1.1 OVERVIEW
California’s        housing        and
planning laws require every
town, city, and county to
have a General Plan with at
least         seven         elements,
including a Housing Element.
The General Plan is the
constitution for development
in Corte Madera. The General
Plan is a long range planning
document          that      describes
goals, policies and programs
to guide decision-making in
land use and other important
areas of local government.                                    San Clemente Place
Unlike the other mandatory
General Plan elements, the
Housing Element is required
to be updated every eight years, and is subject to detailed statutory requirements and
mandatory review by a State agency — HCD (Department of Housing and Community
Development). According to State law, the Housing Element must:
     •    Provide goals, policies, quantified objectives and scheduled programs to preserve,
          improve and develop housing.
     •    Identify and analyze existing and projected housing needs for all economic segments
          of the community.
     •    Identify “adequate sites” that are zoned and available within the 8 year housing
          cycle to meet the city’s fair share of regional housing needs at all income levels.
     •    Be reviewed by the State Department of Housing and Community Development
          (HCD) to determine whether or not the element complies with state law.
     •    Be internally consistent with other parts of the General Plan.
This document is an update of the Town’s State-certified Housing Element that was adopted
in April 2011.
1.2 HOUSING IN CORTE MADERA
The Town of Corte Madera is located in Marin County, approximately eight miles north of
the Golden Gate Bridge. Incorporated in 1916, the Town of Corte Madera encompasses
approximately 4.5 square miles in total. However, 1.25 square miles of this area is
submerged under bay waters and .67 square mile is protected marshland, leaving a net land

                                                           1.0 INTRODUCTION
area of 2.55 square miles. Parks, open space, and flood control areas comprise 0.38 square
mile of this net land area. Highway 101, the main freeway connecting San Francisco with
the Marin communities and Sonoma County, bisects Corte Madera. The Town’s most
significant growth period was from 1940 to 1970 when the community’s population
increased from 1,098 to 8,464.
Housing affordability in Marin County and in the Bay Area as a whole has become an
increasingly important issue. Corte Madera’s housing conditions are reflective of many area-
wide and even nation-wide trends. Over the past several decades, housing costs have
skyrocketed out of proportion to many people’s ability to pay, with increasing construction
and land costs contributing to the rise in housing prices, and in the Bay Area in particular,
the high demand for housing pushing prices even higher. This mismatch in household
incomes and housing costs has a number of implications: it becomes more difficult for
employers to recruit and retain employees; roadways are clogged with workers traveling
longer distances; and many young families, longtime residents, and other community
members relocate because they can no longer afford to live in the community.
There are limitations to what the Town of Corte Madera can do about these housing
affordability problems. The Town is essentially built out, with extremely limited land
remaining for additional housing. Available residential sites are mostly limited to steep
parcels with restrictions due to access problems, soil stability, drainage, parking, etc. The
primary means Corte Madera has to address its affordable housing needs is the
development of a very limited number of vacant and underutilized parcels and through
development of second units on single-family parcels. One of the challenges of Corte
Madera’s Housing Element update will be to properly address local housing needs and
regional fair share requirements while ensuring that new housing will “fit-in” with the
character, quality, environmental constraints and resources of the community.
1.3 THE 2009 GENERAL PLAN
State law requires a community’s General Plan to be internally consistent. This means that
the policies of one element are not legally superior to the policies of another. Every element
of the General Plan must be consistent with all other elements. Each element’s analysis and
goals, policies, and implementation programs must be consistent and complementary. The
2015-2023 Housing Element has been drafted to be consistent with the rest of the General
Plan, which was updated in 2009. When any Element of the General Plan is amended in the
future, the Housing Element will be reviewed and amended, if necessary, to ensure
consistency.
In 2011, the Governor signed SB 244 which requires local governments to make
determinations regarding “disadvantaged unincorporated communities,” defined as a
community with an annual median income that is less than 80 percent of the statewide
annual median household income.           The Town has determined that there are no
unincorporated island, fringe or legacy communities, as defined in the legislation, inside or
near its boundaries.

1.4 HOUSING ELEMENT LAW
State law establishes requirements for all portions of the General Plan. However, for the
Housing Element, the State requirements tend to be more specific and extensive than for
other elements. The purpose of a housing element is described in Government Code
§65583.
          “The housing element shall consist of an identification and analysis of
          existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies,
          quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled programs for the
          preservation, improvement, and development of housing. The housing
          element shall identify adequate sites for housing, including rental housing,
          factory-built housing, mobile homes, and emergency shelters, and shall
          make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all
          economic segments of the community.”
While jurisdictions must review and revise all elements of their General Plan on a regular
basis to ensure that they remain up to date (approximately every ten to fifteen years), State
law requires that Housing Elements be reviewed and updated every eight years. The
process of updating Housing Elements is to be initiated by the State through the ‘regional
housing needs’ process, described below.
State law is also quite specific in terms of what the Housing Element must contain:
     a. “An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints
          relevant to meeting these needs;”
     b. “A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to
          the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing;” and,
     c. “A program, which sets forth a schedule of actions...to implement the policies and
          achieve the goals and objectives.”
Most importantly, the Housing Element must: (1) Identify adequate sites with appropriate
zoning densities and infrastructure to meet the community’s ”fair share” housing needs
(including housing for extremely low, very low, low and moderate income households); and
(2) address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints
to housing development.
State law requires that every updated Housing Element be submitted to the State of
California’s Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to ensure
compliance with the State’s minimum requirements. This ‘certification’ process is unique
among the General Plan elements.
Housing Elements are submitted twice to HCD for review and comment: Once during
development of the Housing Element (in draft form), and again after adoption of the
Housing Element by the local jurisdiction. The first review period requires a maximum 60
days and must take place prior to adoption by the Corte Madera Town Council. During the
first review, HCD will provide comments to the Town regarding compliance of the draft
Element with State law requirements and HCD guidelines. Modifications to the draft Housing
Element in response to these comments are appropriate. The Town Council must consider
HCD’s comments prior to adoption of the Housing Element as part of the General Plan. The
second review requires a maximum 90 days and takes place after adoption. It is after the

second review that written findings regarding compliance are submitted to the local
government.
For this housing element cycle, HCD is providing eligible local governments with an option
to utilize a streamlined review process. This new process is intended to create efficiencies
in the preparation of the updated element as well as clarity and brevity in HCD’s review
process. Recognizing that much of the information in an existing and previously-certified
housing element may still be current, the streamlined review allows the local government to
submit a housing element that indicates where changes have been made. HCD will review
the changes that have occurred since the prior planning period and will accept those
sections that have not changed as continuing to be in compliance with statutory
requirements.
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION (RHNA)
A unique aspect of State Housing Element law is the “regional fair share” standard. Every
town and county in the State of California has a legal obligation to provide for its “fair
share” of the projected future housing needs in the region in which it is located. For Corte
Madera and other Bay Area jurisdictions, the Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) is
determined by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), based upon an overall
regional housing need number established by the State. That need is divided into four
income categories of housing affordability. The Housing Element must demonstrate that the
Town has adequate suitable sites and the development of the community’s RHNA allocation
is feasible within the 2015-2023 timeframe. Table 1 shows Corte Madera’s RHNA for the
current Housing Element.
       Table 1 Regional Housing Needs Allocation, January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2022

approved since January 1, 2014.
1.5 SOURCES OF HOUSING DATA
The main sources of data used to prepare the Housing Element were the 2010 U.S. Census
and the 2012 American Community Survey (five-year estimates). The Census remains the
most comprehensive and widely accepted source of information on demographic

characteristics, and provides consistency with other regional, State and federal housing
plans. The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing statistical survey that samples a
small percentage of the population every year. The ACS survey can have wide margins of
error, especially for small communities, but the survey collects information that is not
covered by the decennial Census. All ACS figures reported in this housing element should be
regarded as estimates.
Additional data sources included:
    •    Population projections and housing counts from the California State Department of
         Finance;
    •    The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) Projections 2013 document
         provides population, household and employment projections;
    •    Household income and affordability data by type of household is derived from the
         Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) prepared by HUD utilizing 2011
         American Community Survey 5-year estimates;
    •    Housing market information is updated through RealFacts rental surveys, Marin
         County Assessor sales data, and internet real estate listings and sales data;
    •    ABAG’s 2014-2022 Regional Housing Needs Plan for the San Francisco Bay Area
         provides information on existing and projected housing needs; and
    •    The Marin Housing Authority and the Marin Countywide Housing Workbook (2009);
    •    Commuting data is obtained from the Census Transportation Planning Package
         utilizing the 2010 American Community Survey 5-year estimates;
    •    Wage data is from the State of California Economic Development Department.
1.6 PREPARATION OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The Housing Element must identify community involvement and decision-making processes
and techniques that are affirmative steps to generate input from low-income persons and
their representatives, as well as from members of the community. This means that input
should be sought, received, and considered before the draft Housing Element is completed.
Requirements for public participation are described in Section 65583(c)(8) of the
Government Code.
The Corte Madera Housing Element update process began with two community workshops
held on June 30 and July 24, 2014, to solicit comments from the community on directions
for the Housing Element. This input helped identify key issues and strategic directions to
pursue in the Housing Element update.
The overall intent of the community workshop was to solicit ideas for the update of the
Town of Corte Madera Housing Element. Specific purposes of the community workshop
were to (1) share information on demographic trends, housing needs, and existing housing

conditions; (2) review progress made to date in implementing the housing element and
provide a forum to hear from community members about how the Town can improve
housing policies and programs, (3) identify possible housing strategies to consider in the
Housing Element Update, (4) share perspectives on barriers and opportunities for the
development of affordable housing in Corte Madera, and (5) review affordable housing
opportunity sites to retain in the Town’s Housing Element Update.
Noticing for the community workshop included outreach via the Town’s e-notification system
and on the Town’s website, contact with affordable housing advocates and providers,
advertisements in the locally published newspapers, and a notice posted on the Corte
Madera Recreation Center reader board. The Marin Environmental Housing Collaborative,
Fair Housing of Marin, and the Marin Workforce Housing Trust were notified of the
workshop.         In addition, the following organizations were notified of the Planning
Commission and Town Council meetings on the housing element: EAH; Housing Leadership
Alliance; League of Women Voters; Legal Aid of Main; Marin Center for Independent Living;
Marin Community Housing Action Initiative; Marin Grassroots; Marin Partnership to End
Homelessness; Northbay Family Homes; Public Advocates; Ritter Center; and West Bay
Housing.
Items identified in the community outreach effort that are addressed in the updated
Housing Element through current, modified and/or new policies or programs include:
     1. Encourage the development of second units, recognizing that these can provide
         an important source of income for lower-income seniors who want to age in
         place, as well as affordable housing for caretakers and other lower-income
         service providers or family members.
     2. Improve housing options for seniors.
     3. Consider commercial sites that can accommodate mixed use housing.
     4. Look at underutilized sites with aging and/or functionally obsolete buildings for
         potential affordable housing sites.
     5. Advance sustainability goals, e.g., encourage housing within walking distance of
         transit and major destinations, and promote home offices and live-work spaces.
A summary of the community workshops is included in Appendix A.
Other community outreach includes public work sessions on the Preliminary Draft Housing
Element with the Corte Madera Planning Commission and Town Council, review of the Draft
Housing Element by the public and the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) as required by State law, and then public hearings on the Draft
Housing Element with the Planning Commission and Town Council.
1.7 2011 HOUSING ELEMENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Government Code Section 65588 requires that the Housing Element include an analysis of
the effectiveness of the Element, progress in implementation, and the appropriateness of
goals, policies, and programs.

Corte Madera’s current Housing Element was adopted by the Town Council on April 5, 2011.
The California Department of Housing and Community Development certified the Housing
Element on July 18, 2011. The goals policies and programs have been successful, despite
the great recession which significantly reduced housing production in all jurisdictions. The
Town met 75% of its low and very low income housing need through the development of an
affordable housing project at San Clemente Place . Table 2 shows housing production during
the last housing element cycle, based on certificates of occupancy issued between 2007 and
2013.

In addition to new housing production, the Town conserved 31 affordable ownership units,
in addition to other rehabilitated homes, meeting its quantified objective for the 2007-2014
planning period. Seventy two units of the 126-unit Madera Vista project (now known as the
Preserve at Marin) were rehabilitated, while the remaining units are currently under
construction.
Implementation programs completed since adoption of the 2011 Housing Element include:
     •     Adopted zoning provisions to accommodate emergency shelters pursuant to
           Government Code Section 65583(a)(4)(A). Emergency shelters are now a permitted
           use in the Public/Semi-Public District. (Program H-1.5.a.b)
     •     Revised the Zoning Ordinance to comply with Government Code Section 65583(a)(5)
           to allow transitional and supportive housing as a residential use in all zoning
           districts, subject to the same permitting procedures and development standards
           required of housing of a similar type in the same zone. (Program H-1.5.a.a)
     •     Adopted a Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance to establish a procedure for
           individuals with disabilities to make requests for reasonable accommodation in land
           use, zoning and building regulations, policies and procedures. (Program H-1.5.b)
     •     Amended the Zoning Ordinance to include Mixed Use at the Corte Madera Gateway
           Area (MUGD) Overlay District. A 180-unit multifamily development is now under
           construction on the site. (Program H-2.7.b)
     •     Adopted an ordinance to establish provisions for complying with State density bonus
           law (Government Code Section 65915 to 65918).
     •     Adopted a Nuisance Ordinance that authorizes the Town to abate poorly maintained
           properties. (Program H-3.7.b)

2.1 OVERVIEW
This section of the Housing
Element describes charac-
teristics of Corte Madera’s
population and housing stock
and assesses the community’s
existing and future housing
needs. The data and analysis
in this section are intended to
satisfy, in part, Government
Code Section 65583(a),which
requires an assessment of
housing needs including an
analysis of population and
employment trends (GC 65583
(a)(1)) and household charac-
                                                             Aegis Assisted Housing
teristics (GC 65583 (a)(2)).
2.2 POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT
POPULATION GROWTH
The population of Marin County continues to grow, but the rate of growth is slowing. In
2010, the population was 252,409 (2010 U.S. Census), up from the 2000 figure of 247,289
(2000 U.S. Census). This represents an annual increase of about 0.2%. In 2012, the
population of Marin County was estimated to be 256,069 (2012 American Community
Survey). Over the next several decades, the average annual growth rate is expected to rise
slightly to about 0.5% due to household and employment growth in the county and nearby
job centers, including San Francisco.

Similarly, Corte Madera will grow, but at a slower rate. In the year 2000, the U.S. Census
found a total population of 9,100. By 2010, the population had grown to 9,253 at an annual
growth rate of about 0.2%. The average annual growth rate is expected to fluctuate
between 0.2% and 0.4% over the next three decades, similar to most other Marin
communities. The Association of Bay Area Governments projects the Corte Madera
population will increase by approximately 450 people by 2025.

AGE CHARACTERISTICS
Table 4 shows the age distribution of Corte Madera residents in 1990, 2000, and 2010.
Important changes since 1990 include a substantial increase in the number of school
age children, a decline in the number of people from 20 to 44 years old, and significant
increases in age groups 45 years old and over.

children (the 5 to 19 year group) increased by 18% during this period. This age group
comprised about 20% of the total Corte Madera population in 2010, up from 12% in
1990.
Children under the age 18 comprised 25% of the population in 2010, up from 18% in
1990 (Figure 2). The percentage of the senior population also increased over these two
decades, from 14% to 16% of the total population. The population of adults aged 18 to
64 dropped significantly, from 69% to 59% of the population (Figure 2).

These age group patterns reflect the community’s niche in the housing market. The
excellent public schools, proximity to high paying jobs, and easy freeway access are
attractive to middle- and upper middle-income families with children who can afford to
buy homes in Corte Madera.
The Corte Madera senior population is increasing at a rate that far surpasses the
national rate for this population. Between 2000 and 2010, the population of Corte
Madera residents age 65 or older grew by 23 percent, while the rest of the Corte Madera
population (under 65 years old) fell by 1.6 percent. By comparison, the population of
seniors in the United States grew by 15 percent, while the rest of the population grew
by 9 percent.
The Department of Finance predicts significant increases in Marin’s elderly population as
the baby boom generation ages. While the Department of Finance expects the total
population in Marin to increase by less than one percent between 2010 and 2030, the
number of seniors 65 and over is projected to increase by over 57 percent. 1 By the year
2030, approximately 26 percent of the Marin population will be aged 65 or more;
currently, 16 percent of the Corte Madera population is 65 or older. Many of these older
residents will choose to “age in place,” increasing demand for home supportive services,
or stay in their community if adequate senior housing is available. The aging population
is also expected to increase demand for assisted living and senior residential facilities.
Finally, the median age in Corte Madera at 44.8 years is slightly above the countywide
median of 44.6, but significantly higher than the statewide median of 35.2 years in 2012
(Figure 4). The median age in Corte Madera has increased about 5 years since 1990.

RACE AND IDENTITY
Table 5 displays the racial/ethnic distribution of Corte Madera’s population in 2000 and
2010. The community has experienced small changes since 2000, with persons who self-
identify as “white” continuing to make up the majority of the population at about 84%.
Hispanics and Latinos, the second largest ethnic or racial group in Corte Madera, are
also the fastest growing group, increasing 77% over the decade. Hispanics currently
comprise about 8% of the total population in Corte Madera and 16% of the total Marin
County population.

It is generally considered ideal to have a range of 1.0 to 1.5 jobs per housing unit in a
jurisdiction. A balance between the number of jobs and occupied housing units can help
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, freeway congestion, and fuel consumption as well as
improve air quality due to the theoretical self-sufficiency it implies. However, a one-to-
one balance of jobs to housing does not guarantee a reduction in commute trips. With
a total of 3,793 occupied housing units, Corte Madera had an estimated average of 2.1
jobs for every household in 2010. This is significantly higher than the Marin County rate
of 1.1 jobs per household. ABAG projects that the jobs/housing balance will remain at
the same level, falling to 2.0 jobs per household by 2035. At the same time, the
County’s job/housing balance is expected to increase slightly, to 1.2 jobs per household
by 2040.
There is a significant disparity between the types of jobs and the cost of housing
throughout Marin, including in Corte Madera. In 2013 the median sales price for a single
family home in the county was $1,131,772, and the median price for a condominium
was $505,285 These prices were far out of reach for the annual wage of $368,095 for
Marin-based jobs. Average annual wages for a sampling of jobs held by those who live
or work in Corte Madera are shown in Table 12.

The mismatch between jobs and housing in Corte Madera is particularly acute. The
job/housing imbalance in Corte Madera is due to growth of office and retail jobs in the
1970s, 80s and 90s, a relative lack of multi-family housing, and limited building site
opportunities.

2.3 HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
This section describes characteristics and trends in Corte Madera households that help
to define current and future housing needs in the community. The U.S. Census Bureau
defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit, including families, single
people, or unrelated persons. Persons living in licensed facilities or dormitories are not
considered households.

HOUSEHOLD GROWTH
While total population grew by 12% from 1990 to 2010, the number of households in
town increased by only 6%. Data from the 2012 American Community Survey (ACS)
shows an increase of 129 households between 2010 and 2012. 2

HOUSEHOLD SIZE
The difference between the rate of population growth and the increase in the number of
households is reflected in an increase in the average size of households since 1990. In
part at least, this is due to younger households with children, who are attracted to the
excellent public and private schools in the area, replacing households without children.

  Although 2012 ACS data is included in the housing element in order to provide the most recent data available, these
ACS datasets should be viewed with caution as they are based on survey data with relatively small sample sizes and
typically have large margins of error for smaller jurisdictions. For example, the estimated number of households in Corte
Madera in 2012 has a margin of error of +/- 187 households. All ACS figures reported in this housing element should be
regarded as estimates.

TENURE
Corte Madera is predominantly a community of homeowners, reflecting the stock of
single family detached homes and the market demand of middle- to upper-income
households who can afford to buy their own homes. In 2012, approximately 72% of the
housing units were owner-occupied and 28% were renter-occupied (2012 American
Community Survey).

In 2012, more than one half of the households in Corte Madera had incomes of
$100,000 or more. For statistical purposes, income is often analyzed in terms of mean
household income and median household income. The U.S. Census Bureau determines
mean housheold income by dividing total income by the number of households. Median
income is the amount which divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half
having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount.
The estimated median household income for California in 2012 was $61,400 (American
Community Survey). In 2012, the median household income in Corte Madera was
$107,723 and the mean (average) household income was $147,461.

RECENT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TRENDS
In the post-World War II era and into the 1990s, most residential construction in Corte
Madera was single-family detached homes. However, in the late 1990s, this trend began

to shift as the last remaining large tracts of vacant residentially zoned land were
subdivided and built out. Between 1996 and 1998, 138 single family homes were built in
Madera del Presidio. Beginning in 2000, building permits and housing construction in
Corte Madera began to focus on multifamily housing. After 2000, single family
construction has occurred on few of the remaining individual lots in the community,
rather than as part of a subdivision.
The California Department of Finance estimated there were 4,026 housing units in Corte
Madera as of January 2014 (Table 19).

Two projects – San Clemente Place and Aegis of Corte Madera – accounted for the
majority of new housing from 2000 to 2013. San Clemente Place, located at 33 San
Clemente Drive, is predominantly family housing; most of the apartments have two and
three bedrooms. Aegis of Corte Madera, at 5555 Paradise Drive is rental housing for
seniors. The rental package at Aegis includes assisted living services. Both San Clemente
Place and Aegis developed as privately sponsored, high density, mixed-use
redevelopment projects. San Clemente Place with a density of 29 units per acre,
occupies the site of a former lumberyard. The residential project developed as a
partnership with a self-storage property on an adjacent property. The density at Aegis of
Corte Madera is 40 units to the acre. Aegis developed as part of the redevelopment of
the Paradise Shopping Center.

In addition, a new 180-unit multifamily project, Tam Ridge Residences, is under
construction and is expected to be completed by spring 2015. The project consists of six
buildings with 38 one-bedroom units, 95 two-bedroom units, and 29 three-bedroom
units. The project was built at a density of 40 units per acre.
NUMBER OF BEDROOMS
The majority of owner-occupied homes (53%) in Corte Madera have three bedrooms,
while the majority (38%) of rental units have two bedrooms. Sixty-four percent of the
housing stock consists of three or more bedrooms. It is likely that many Corte Madera
households are “over-housed” since only 37% of households have three or more
persons.

VACANCY RATES
The high demand for housing throughout the County results in consistently low vacancy
rates in Corte Madera. The American Community Survey estimates nearly 2% of Corte
Madera’s housing units were vacant in 2012. Approximately one-quarter of the vacant
units were either sold or rented, but not occupied.
Housing experts recommend that a 5% rental vacancy rate is needed to assure choice in
the marketplace and to promote economic competition that moderates price. Low
vacancy rates make it difficult for tenants to find appropriate units, and strong market
pressure inflates rents. Countywide data reports a rental vacancy rate of 2.8% in Marin
in the second quarter of 2014, with vacancy rates fluctuating between 2.7% and 4.9%
over the past two years (RealFacts). While comparable data is not available for Corte
Madera alone, it is likely that the vacancy rate in Corte Madera is similar or lower. This
indicates that Corte Madera’s rental market is constrained, with demand outpacing
available supply.

HOUSING PRICES AND TRENDS
Housing sales prices and rental costs directly affect housing problems in the community.
High housing costs that are disproportionate to household incomes will result in
overpayment for residents who do not have other options, and extended commutes for
lower salaried jobs that serve the community. This section describes the rental and
homeownership markets in Corte Madera.
Rental Housing Market
According to RealFacts data rental prices countywide increased 22% between 2001 and
2013. Rents retreated to their lowest level in 2005, but gradually recovered to their
earlier highs by 2011. Over the past two and one-half years, rents have been increasing
at a brisk pace, by about 8% in both 2012 and 2013 and by another 8% in the first half
of 2014 (Figure 10).
                                 Figure 10 Average Rents in Marin County
In the second quarter of 2014, the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom, one-
bathroom apartment in Marin County was $1,924and $2,676 for a two-bedroom, two-
bathroom unit. .
Table 24 compares costs for one-, two- and three-bedroom rentals in Marin County.

Ownership Housing Market
The rate at which homes sold in Corte Madera generally kept pace with the rise and fall
of the economy between 2003 and 2013 (Figure 11). Single family sales ebbed to a low
of 68 sales in 2009 and then rebounded, surpassing the highs set in the 2003-2005
period. By 2013, 121 single family homes were sold annually.

condominiums sold in 2013, just slightly more than the average annual rate of 28 units
over the eleven-year period.

2.5 HOUSEHOLD INCOME, HOUSING COSTS, AND THE
ABILITY TO PAY FOR HOUSING
Housing that costs 30% or less of a household’s income is referred to as ”affordable
housing.” Because household incomes and sizes vary, the price that is considered
“affordable” for each household also varies. For example, a large family with one income
may be able to afford a different type of housing than a two-income household with no
children. Households paying more than 30% of their income for housing are generally
considered to be overpaying or cost-burdened. For homeowners, this includes mortgage
costs, taxes, and insurance. For rental housing, the cost usually includes rent and
utilities.
The impact of housing costs             is most severe on extremely low-, very low- and low-
income households, especially           renters. Higher income households may voluntarily chose
to spend more than 30% of               their income for housing, but lower income households
generally have no choice but            to overpay because of the lack of housing affordable to
their incomes.
Income bands are calculated by several agencies for purposes of calculating housing
affordability. Income levels are expressed as a percentage of Area Median Income
(AMI). Table 27 lists the income levels by household size for Marin County as defined by
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

RENTER AFFORDABILITY
Table 28 compares the maximum affordable rents (30% of household income) for
extremely low-, very low-, lower and moderate-income households to median apartment
rents in Corte Madera. This analysis indicates that there are no market-rate rentals in
Corte Madera affordable to very low-income households. While a one-person low-income
household could afford a studio rental, a larger low-income household would not be able
to find an apartment they could afford and that would meet their space needs. The
Corte Madera rental market does offer units that moderate-income households can
afford.

The median sales price for a Corte Madera condominium in 2013 was $583,500, which is
beyond reach of moderate income households in Corte Madera. This represents an
affordability gap of about $140,000 for a one-bedroom condominium and $86,000 for a
two-bedroom condominium. As is true for most of the Bay area, home sales prices in
Corte Madera are not affordable for moderate-income households.
2.6 OVERPAYING
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides a special
tabulation of American Community Survey data that local governments use for housing
planning as part of HUD’s Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS). The
CHAS tabulations rely on the state and federal standard of an income-to-housing ratio of
30 percent and above for housing overpayment (cost burden). CHAS data (Table 30)
identifies 35% of Corte Madera households as overpaying for housing.
Rental housing is affordable to most moderate and above-moderate-income households
in Corte Madera. A significant proportion of moderate and above-moderate-income
households (23%) are overpaying, however; higher incomes give these households
more options for absorbing the other costs of living after housing expenses are met.
As would be expected, the housing cost burden weighs most heavily on the lower end of
the household income scale. Seventy-eight percent of extremely low-income households
and 68% of very low-income households pay more than 30% of their income for
housing. Extremely low-, very low- and lower-income renters are more likely to be cost
burdened than homeowners in the same income cohorts. At least a portion of the
extremely low-, very low-, and lower-income homeowners own their homes outright or

have longstanding, relatively low cost mortgages. Nevertheless, retired homeowners,
even if they have paid off the mortgage, may still be overburdened with taxes,
insurance, and utility expenses, which count as part of the cost of housing.

Strategies and Programatic Responses to Meet Projected Overpayment Needs
Resources and programs available to meet the needs of Corte Madera households that
are overpaying include –
    Section 8 –Rental vouchers are available for low income households through the
                  section 8 program administered by the Marin Housing Authority. Currently,
                  there are 31 vouchers issued in Corte Madera. When the Housing Authority
                  opened the waiting list for a week in September 2008, approximately
                  11,200 households applied. Of those, 2831 applicants (25%) were from
                  Marin County, and 92 were Corte Madera households.
    Privately managed affordable rentals – EAH Housing, a nonprofit corporation, owns
                  and operates San Clemente Place, a 79-unit affordable rental project.
    Below market ownership units– There are 31 ownership units with deed restrictions
                  to control the resale prices at rates affordable to moderate- and low-income
                  households.
Extremely low-income needs are particularly acute. San Clemente Place includes 60
units that are available to extremely low-income households, and Section 8 vouchers can
address this need as well.

                                            2.0 HOUSING NEEDS ANALYSIS
The fundamental strategy for addressing the Town’s long-term overpayment problem is
to create new opportunities for redevelopment to mixed use with an emphasis on
affordable housing. This is reflected in Policy H-2.9, Mixed-Use Housing and the
corresponding implementation programs, H-2.9.a and H-2.9.b. Policy H-2.10 provides
incentives for affordable housing developments. Policies in this Housing Element
promote second units are an important option for affordability (H-2.15 Second Dwelling
Units and H-2.16 Second Dwelling Units in New Development). Other policies and
programs address housing overpayment directly, including H-1.11 Rental Assistance
Programs, which would require new apartment projects to accept Section 8, and H-2.5
First-Time Homebuyer Programs. Finally, Policy H-2.11 Long-Term Housing Affordability
Controls assures that units will remain affordable.
2.7 OVERCROWDING

overcrowded.                Overcrowding
increases the risk for health and safety problems and stresses the condition of the
housing stock. Overcrowding affects only a very limited number of households in Corte
Madera and is not addressed with specific policies in this Housing Element.
2.8 ASSISTED DEVELOPMENTS AT RISK OF CONVERSION
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65583, subdivision (a), paragraph (8), this sub-
section should include an analysis of existing assisted housing developments (as defined
by the statute) that are eligible to change from low-income housing uses during the next
ten years due to termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage prepayment, or expiration
of restrictions on use. For purposes of the Housing Element, assisted housing
developments are defined as multifamily rental complexes that receive government
assistance under any of the programs listed in Government Code Section 65863.10.
There is a single Corte Madera development that is funded by one or more programs
listed in Government Code Section 65863.10: San Clemente Place. This development is
subject to a 55-year deed restriction to maintain affordability, and as such is not at risk
of changing from low-income use during the next ten years.
2.9 SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
In addition to overall housing needs, the Town must plan for housing for special needs
groups. The elderly, disabled people, large families, farmworkers, families with female
heads of household, and families and individuals with emergency shelter needs often

have a particularly difficult time finding decent, affordable housing due to their
circumstances. In addition, households and individuals in these groups frequently
require specialized housing to accommodate their unique needs. Table 32 summarizes
the number of households or individuals in these special needs categories. Homeless
persons are a special needs group, but were not counted in the American Community
Survey, because data collection was residence-based, and the homeless do not have
residences.

SENIORS
The 2012 American Community Survey found that nearly 17% of Corte Madera’s
population, or 1,536 residents, were 65 years or older, and that 25% of the heads of
household were senior citizens (Table 31). Older residents have particular housing needs
that can be addressed with local planning policies.
Nearly 90% of Corte Madera’s senior households own their homes, and 75% of the
owner-occupied housing in the community has three or more bedrooms. Many elderly
residents need the option of smaller, more efficient housing as they become less mobile.
The high number of older residents with disabilities, almost 33% of Corte Madera’s
seniors, points to the need for barrier-free, accessible housing. As people age, there is
an increasing need for housing with health care and personal services provided. In many
cases, income drops as seniors age. In 2012, 5.9% of Corte Madera residents 65 years
or older were in poverty (2012 American Community Survey). Analysis of the 2012 CHAS
data (Table 33) shows that 535 of 1,100 senior households in Corte Madera (defined by
CHAS as 62 years and older) had incomes that were 80% or less than the median and

that 58% of these senior households paid more than 30% of their income for housing.
Seniors are more likely to have lower incomes than other members of the community
and have particular issues finding affordable housing that meets their needs.

               Note: CHAS data defines seniors as age 62 and over
The stock of housing in Corte Madera targeted specifically to seniors has increased with
the completion of the 118-unit Aegis project in 2002. Aegis provides for a range of
senior housing needs by offering assisted living and Alzheimer and dementia care. Nine
of the Aegis units are deed-restricted for low and very low income seniors, but these
residents must pay the same fees for services as other market-rate tenants. While Aegis
addresses the continuum of senior housing needs, the cost is out of reach for most
older residents. This is symptomatic of a basic senior housing problem: low- and very
low-income seniors cannot afford the cost of licensed facilities. The Marin County
Division of Aging reports that the rent (including meals and activities) for assisted living
and memory care apartments at Aegis range from $4,200 to $6,900                                   per month.
Personal care is an additional cost above basic rent.
The number of senior residents in Corte Madera is likely to increase substantially over
the next two decades. The projections in Figure 13 below are based on countywide
projections. With the number of persons 65 and older projected to increase 60%
between the years 2010 and 2030, there will be an increasing need for smaller or
detached housing for independent living, including market rate and below market rate
units.

Strategies and Programatic Responses to Meet Projected Senior Housing Needs
The Town of Corte Madera offers services for senior residents through the Recreation
Department including entry-level computer training, exercise and agility classes, safe
driving classes for older adults, and traditional recreation events and programs. The
Division of Aging and Adult Services of the Marin County Department of Health and
Human Services supports a variety of programs to senior citizens through a network of
local non-profit organizations and governmental agencies in Marin County. Services
include assisted transportation, case management, congregate and home-delivered
meals, family caregiver support, information and assistance, personal care and
homemaker services, adult protective services, in-home supportive services, and public
health nursing programs. Corte Madera is currently supporting the efforts to establish
Age-Friendly Corte Madera, under the umbrella of the World Health Organization, to
identify and implement the needs and services of those aged 60 and over.
This Housing Element includes policies and programs to promote multifamily housing
that will increase housing opportunities for seniors, such as encouraging a full range of
housing types (H-1.1 Diversity of Population, H-1.4 Variety of Housing Choices, and H-
2.8 Retention and Expansion of Multi-Family Sites at Medium and Higher Density).
Second units and single room occupancy units are important options for some seniors
(H-1.4.a Housing Types, H-2.15 Second Dwelling Units, and H-2.16 Second Dwelling
Units in New Development). The updated Housing Element has specific policies for
senior residents with special needs including affordability, adaptability, and density
bonuses (H-1.6 Provision for Affordable Housing for Special Needs Households, H-1.7
Density Bonuses for Special Needs Housing and H-1.6.a Adaptable Units for the
Disabled).

PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Persons with disabilities face unique problems in obtaining affordable and adequate
housing. This segment of the population, which includes individuals with mental,
physical, and developmental disabilities, represent a wide range of housing needs.
Housing designed to be barrier-free, with accessibility modifications, proximity to
services and transit, and group living opportunities are some of the considerations and
accommodations that are important in serving this need group. The need for affordable,
handicapped-accessible housing will increase as the population ages.
Living arrangements for the disabled vary, depending on the type and severity for their
disability, as well as personal preference and lifestyle. Many disabled people live
independently at home with the help of family. Assistance may be necessary to maintain
independent living, including income support, accessibility improvements to the home,
and in-home supportive services.
Housing types that address the needs of the disabled include:
     • single-room occupancy units;
     • group homes for specific need groups with support services;
     • set-asides in larger multifamily affordable projects including senior housing
          developments.
The 79-unit San Clemente Place project is 100% affordable. Five of these units are fully
accessible, and another 53 units are designed to be converted to full accessibility with
simple and inexpensive modifications.

Description of Need
A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more
major life activities. The 2012 American Community Survey found that 8.5% of Corte
Madera residents (786 people) are disabled (Table 34). Approximately 33% of Corte
Madera residents who were 65 years of age or older in 2012 had a disability. An
estimated 43 people had self-care disabilities and required assistance in daily living.
Disabled persons often have fixed or limited incomes due to their disabilities. Of the 772
disabled people aged 18 to 64 identified in the 2012 American Community Survey, 98
individuals were not in the labor force and had a disability (Table 35).

A "developmental disability" means a disability that originates before an individual
attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and
constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes mental retardation,
cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy
are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) provides community-based
services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their
families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers,
and two community-based facilities. The Golden Gate Regional Center is one of 21
regional centers in the State of California that provides point of entry to services for
people with developmental disabilities. The center is a private, non-profit community
agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to
individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. According to the
Department of Developmental Services, there are 16 children and 32 adults over the age
18 with developmentally disabilities within the Corte Madera zip code area of 94925.
This information points to the need for affordable housing with support services.
Licensed group homes and single-room occupancies can address a portion of this need.

Strategies and Programs to Meet Projected Disabled Persons Needs
Appropriate housing for persons with mental or physical disabilities include very low cost
units in large group home settings (near retail services and public transit), supervised
apartment settings with on- or off-site support services, outpatient/day treatment
programs, and inpatient/day treatment programs, crisis shelters and transitional
housing.
There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a developmental
disability: rent subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes,
inclusionary housing, Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, HUD
housing, and SB 962 homes. The design of housing-accessibility modifications, the
proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities
represent some of the types of considerations that are important in serving this need
group.
Title 24 of the State Uniform Building Code mandates that all new multi-family
residential construction projects containing six or more units must conform to specific
disabled adaptability/accessibility regulations. The Title 24 mandate and high density
residential zoning address the needs of several categories of disabled persons, especially
the needs of people with physical disabilities. The needs of other disabled people, in
addition to basic affordability, range from needing slight modifications of existing units
to the need for a variety of supportive housing arrangements. Some of the disabled
population can only live successfully in housing that provides a semi-sheltered, semi-
independent living, such as clustered group housing or other group- living quarters.
Others are capable of living independently if affordable units are available. Group homes
caring for up to 6 persons are allowed by right in all residential districts.
Policies and programs in this Housing Element recognize the special needs of disabled
persons including basic civil rights in housing, the need for physical accommodation, and
the difficulty many disabled persons have finding housing they can afford (H-1.2 Equal
Housing Opportunity, H-1.2.a Anti-Discrimination Ordinance, H-1.5 Special Needs
Housing, H-1.6 Provision of Affordable Housing for Special Needs Households, H-1.6.a
Adaptable Units for the Disabled, H-1.6.b Residential Care Homes, and H-1.7 Density
Bonuses for Special Needs Housing) In addition, the Town has adopted procedures for
people with disabilities to request reasonable accommodation in the application of
zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures.
LARGE FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS
The Census Bureau defines large-family households as households with five or more
persons. Large families tend to have a difficult time finding adequate housing due to the
limited supply of adequate units, particularly affordable rentals.
Description of Need
The 2012 American Community Survey estimates there ae 119 large-family households,
of which 36 households are renters (Table 36).

The market provides an adequate selection of larger units for homeowners who can
afford them, but the stock of rentals with three or more bedrooms is very limited. The

There are 2,507 homes with 3 or more bedrooms in Corte Madera, an amount that
exceeds the current estimated need for large families. However, all of the cost-burdened
large family households in Corte Madera are very low-income households, and these
households are unlikely to be able to afford adequately-sized apartments at market
rents (Table 38). Overpayment data (see Table 38) indicates that 10 large-family renting
households spent more than 30% of their income for housing. This represents 15% of
all large family households.
Strategies and Programs to Meet the Projected Needs of Large-Family Households
Large families would benefit from multifamily housing that includes childcare facilities.
Housing with large-family units should include adequate recreation facilities for children,
and should be located near public transit.
The preceding needs analysis indicates that the number of homes in Corte Madera with
three or more bedrooms is greater than the number of large families. However, the
Housing Element recognizes that there is a need for three bedroom rental units (H-1.8
Housing for Families with Children and H-1.8.a Family Housing Amenities). More
broadly, the Housing element sets fundamental policy that commits the Town to
planning for all households of all sizes and types, and protecting all households from

SINGLE PARENT AND FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
Female-headed households fall into three basic groups in Marin – single professional
women, single parents, and seniors. 3 Single parents and the elderly are particularly
likely to have affordable housing needs. Single mothers not only have difficulty finding
affordable housing, but they also have special needs for childcare, health care, and
other services. Single-parent households may find their choices limited by discrimination
against children.
Description of Need
The 2012 American Community Survey estimates there are 377 female-headed
households, slightly less than 9% of all households in Corte Madera (Table 39).
Moreover, 111 of the female-headed households included children.

Strategies and Programs to Meet Projected Needs
This Housing Element recognizes the potential for discrimination against families with
children, especially in rental housing (H-1.2 Equal Housing Opportunity and H-1.2.a Anti-
Discrimination Ordinance). This Element includes policies promoting affordable,
multifamily housing near transit that would address the needs of many single-parent and
female-headed households (H-2.8 Retention and Expansion of Multi-Family Sites at
Medium and Higher Density and H-2.9 Mixed-Use Housing). Housing for single parent
households should include adequate recreation facilities for children, and should be
located near public transit (H-1.8 Housing for Families with Children and H-1.8.a Family
housing amenities). New single parent households may be assisted with first-time buyer
programs and employee housing (H-2.5 First-Time Homebuyer Programs and H-2.5.a
First-time homebuyer programs).
FARMWORKERS
State law requires that Housing Elements evaluate the need for farmworker housing in
the local jurisdiction. The 2012 American Community Survey estimates there are no
Corte Madera residents employed in farming, and there is no farmworker housing in the
community. Agricultural jobs are concentrated in the western part of Marin County. The
Marin County Housing Element establishes policies to address farmworker housing needs
in West Marin close to job sites.
FAMILIES AND PERSONS IN NEED OF EMERGENCY SHELTERS
Effective January 1, 2008, SB 2 (Chapter 633, Statutes of 2007) requires every California
city and county to develop policy for emergency shelters and transitional and supportive
housing in their next Housing Element revision. To comply with SB2, jurisdictions must
identify and estimate the housing and service needs of homeless persons and families
and assess the unmet need for emergency shelter, transitional and supportive housing.
The Sites Analysis section includes a detailed explanation of the policies that must be
developed to comply with SB 2. The following is a discussion of the special needs of
homeless persons.
The homeless are people who need temporary or emergency shelter. They are
individuals who do not have a fixed income or a regular nighttime residence. Their
needs may be for short-term shelter, or they may have chronic, long-term, unmet
housing needs. The homeless population includes single persons, couples, families,
youth without parents, and seniors. Underlying issues for homeless people often include
recent or extended unemployment, physical disability, substance abuse, teenage
pregnancy/parenthood, domestic violence, AIDS, and other difficult personal and social
circumstances.

Description of Need
The best source of data for estimating the daily average number of homeless people is
the 2013 Marin Homeless Point in Time Count, which was conducted by the Marin
Health and Human Services on January 24, 2013. Health and Human Services, in
partnership with housing and service providers, faith-based groups, and schools
gathered data on unsheltered homeless people (those living on the streets), and those
who were sheltered (living in emergency shelters and transitional housing and other
housing) on the night of the count. The count found 933 homeless persons in the
county, 174 of whom met the HUD definition of unsheltered and in immediate need of
housing. Approximately 0.3% of Marin’s population, or 693 people, meets HUD’s
definition of homeless, which is “a person sleeping in a place not meant for human
habitation (including living on the streets, in an abandoned building, or in a vehicle), or
residing in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.” Statewide, the
homeless are 0.4% of the total population. 4 In addition to the HUD-defined categories
for sheltered and unsheltered homeless people, Marin Health and Human Services
counts sheltered homeless people in other setting not recognized by HUD, such as
motels, jail, hospitals and temporary residence with friends or family (Table 40).

The one-day count does not include a breakdown of unsheltered homeless people by
jurisdiction. Table 41 provides a rough estimate of the number of unsheltered homeless
people by jurisdiction based on the percentage of Marin’s total population that lives in
each community. There were an estimated 6 unsheltered homeless persons in Corte
Madera when the Point in Time Count was taken.
Similarly, data is not available on the breakdown of the sheltered homeless population
by jurisdiction. However, since the vast majority of Marin’s emergency shelters and
transitional housing are located in either San Rafael or Novato, it is likely that most of
the 519 sheltered homeless people were residing in either of those jurisdictions on the
night of the count.

Strategies and Programs to Meet Projected Needs
The Town amended the Zoning Ordinance to comply with Government Code Section
65583(a)(5) to define transitional and supportive housing as residential uses and to
allow these uses in all zones that allow residential uses, subject to the same restrictions
as housing of the same type. The Town also adopted zoning provisions to allow
emergency shelters as a permitted use in the Public/Semi-Public District in order to
comply with Government Code Section 65583(a)(4). This Housing Element includes
policy H-1.5 Special Needs Housing that renews the Town’s commitment to remove
barriers and promote housing to meet special needs, including the needs of the
homeless.

Note: This data is a snapshot of the locations of homeless housing in September 2013. Many of the programs included in
this summary rent market rate housing from private landlords so the distribution of units will definitely change over time. In
addition, vacant units at these types of programs were not counted in this summary so these numbers are slightly lower
than our overall capacity.

2.10 REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) is required to
allocate the region’s share of the statewide housing need to Councils of Government
(COGs) based on California Department of Finance population projections and regional
population forecasts used in preparing regional transportation plans. The COGs in turn
are required to prepare Regional Housing Need Plans allocating the region’s share of the
statewide need to cities and counties within the region. The quantification of each
jurisdiction’s share of the regional housing need is called the Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA).
Town of Corte Madera Housing Element                                                                                        44

                                          2.0 HOUSING NEEDS ANALYSIS
The RHNA is a minimum number. Jurisdictions may plan for and accommodate a larger
number of dwelling units. Jurisdictions must identify adequate sites at appropriate
densities and development standards to accommodate the RHNA allocation. Jurisdictions
must also show how they will facilitate and encourage development of these units, but
they are not required to build or finance the units.
HCD has allocated 187,990 units to the nine-county Bay Area as the region’s share of
the statewide housing need for the period 2014 through 2022. The Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG), the region’s COG, adopted a RHNA for the 2014-2022
planning period that assigns 2,298 housing units (Table 44) to Marin cities and towns
and the county unincorporated area. The Town of Corte Madera’s Regional Housing
Need Allocation is 72 units.

Housing Element law allows jurisdictions to take credit for units constructed or under
construction between the base year of the RHNA period (January 2014) and the
beginning of the new planning period (January 31, 2015). The Tam Ridge Residences
project is currently under construction. Accordingly, the 180 units, including 18
affordable units, in that project can be credited toward the Town’s 2014 to 2022 RHNA
allocation (Table 45). In addition, 3 single family homes are under construction and one
second unit has been developed.

Strategies and Programs to Meet Projected Needs
Corte Madera is a built out community. The few remaining vacant properties tend to be
constrained and difficult to build due to physical conditions such as steep slopes.
Accordingly, the Town’s overarching strategy for achieving its remaining RHNA
objectives will be to develop affordable housing on high-potential housing opportunity
sites (H.2.6 High Potential Housing Opportunity Areas, H-2.6.b Actions for Robin Drive,
H-2.6.c Action for 1421 Casa Buena Drive, and H-2.6.d Actions for Wornum Drive
Extension). These efforts will be supported with affordable housing incentive programs
including overlay zoning districts and bonus programs (H-2.12 Inclusionary Housing
Approach and H-2.10 Incentives for Affordable Housing). The Town will continue to
build on its success supporting second units (H-2.15 Second Dwelling Units and H-2.16
Second Dwelling Units in New Development).
2.11 OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
Housing Elements are required to identify opportunities for energy conservation in
residential development. The Housing Element must inventory and analyze the
opportunities to encourage the incorporation of energy saving features, energy saving
materials, and energy efficient systems and design for residential development. Planning
to maximize energy efficiency and the incorporation of energy conservation and green
building features can contribute to reduced housing costs for homeowners and renters,
in addition to promoting sustainable community design and reduced dependence on
vehicles. Such planning and development standards can also significantly contribute to
reducing greenhouse gases.
The 2009 General Plan includes Chapter 3, the Resource Conservation and Sustainability
Element. Chapter 3 includes policies and programs that promote community
sustainability and effective management of renewable and non-renewable natural
resources through energy conservation, solid waste management and recycling, natural

remaining unmet housing need in Corte Madera is 29 units.
3.2          AVAILABLE LAND INVENTORY
Table 47, Available Land Inventory, identifies specific sites that are available for
residential development.
The inventory incorporates data from a combination of resources, including Assessor’s
information, field surveys, and a review of the Town’s Land Use Element and the Zoning
Ordinance. The inventory lists vacant, residentially zoned properties in the community as
well as developed, non-residential properties that can be redeveloped for, and/or
rezoned for, residential or mixed-use development that includes residential. The
inventory determined that there are no underutilized, residentially zoned sites that are
capable of being developed at a higher density. Similarly, the inventory found that there
are no vacant, non-residentially zoned sites that allow residential uses.
The Available Land Inventory lists individual properties by General Plan land use
designation and zoning. To demonstrate the realistic unit capacity of the sites, the
Inventory lists the following information for each property:
     •    Allowable density – the number of dwelling units permitted per acre is listed to
          support the analysis of realistic unit capacity. In some cases, rezoning may be
          required to conform to the General Plan land use designation. In those cases, the
          allowable density figure listed in the inventory is the density set by the General
          Plan land use designation.
     •    Size – The size of each site in the inventory is listed in acres to support the
          analysis of realistic unit capacity.
     •    Infrastructure capacity – In all cases, infrastructure is available at or adjacent to
          the site.

 Realistic Development Capacity
 The following is an analysis of three sites, larger than one acre, that are likely to
 develop during the planning period for this Housing Element. In addition, a number of
 small sites, each capable of supporting one single family detached unit, are also
 analyzed.
 Site 1: Wornum Drive Extension
 This 1.4-acre property is owned by the Town of Corte Madera. This single-parcel site is
 flat, long, and narrow. The site is vacant, except for a public pedestrian/bike path that
 extends east/west through the property, ultimately extending more than 2.5 miles and
 connecting to residential and commercial neighborhoods in Corte Madera and the
 adjacent City of Larkspur. Vegetation on the site is grass and weeds, and includes
 approximately 0.4 acres of salt marsh wetlands.
 The property is located on Tamal Vista Boulevard, a major arterial that has sidewalks on
 both sides. Adjacent uses are a light industrial/office complex on the north and medium
 density condominiums on the south side. A 180-unit apartment building, currently under
 construction, is located directly across the street to the east. A shopping center that
 includes a grocery store and pharmacy is located within 0.3 mile of the site. The
 Highway 101 bus pad is within easy walking distance.

 A site utilization study (Table 48) shows that a -20-unit multi-family project with one-
 bedroom units can be accommodated on the property within the regulations of the AHE-
 B Overlay District (see box next page). The units would be in two two-story buildings
 with 22 parking spaces. This hypothetical project is below the maximum density
 permitted by the district, and the lot coverage would be 13.1% where 35% is allowed.
 The length and width of the parcel are adequate to accommodate the required setbacks.
 The 38-foot height limit in the AHE-B would allow a 2-story building.

 EIR).
 Realistic development capacity at the Wornum Drive Extension site
 The AHE-B overlay district is intended to enhance the development potential of the
 properties it regulates. The AHE-B district includes the following incentives for affordable
 housing in addition to the potential density bonus:
     •    Reduced parking requirements.
     •    All town processing and impact fees may be waived by the Town Council.
     •    Application process includes a single design review approval.
 In order to advance development on the site, the Town will partner with a qualified non-
 profit developer to explore the feasibility of building affordable housing on the site as
 described in Implementation Program H-2.6.d.The Town has recent experience
 partnering with developers to facilitate higher density affordable projects. The Town
 worked closely with the non-profit sponsor of the San Clemente Place project,
 completed in 2008. That project was developed at 29 units/acre with zoning incentives
 similar to the AHE-B district. The program outlined in Table 48 would result in a
 residential project similar in character to the adjacent condominium project.
 Based on the development controls and incentives in the AHE-B district, the ease of site
 development, the findings of the 2002 Housing Element EIR, the Town’s experience
 implementing a similar overlay district for the San Clemente Place project,
 Implementation Program H-2.6.d, and compatibility with the adjacent residential
 development, the Wornum drive Extension property has a realistic development capacity
 of 20 units.

 Site # 2 – 1421 Casa Buena Drive
 This 1.23-acre property is flat and roughly rectangular (approximately 135’ X 420’). The
 property is accessed from Casa Buena Drive, a secondary arterial that serves as a
 frontage road to Highway 101. The property is partially developed with one vacant,
 dilapidated, and uninhabitable home and a second single-family home, currently
 occupied, that was built in the 1950’s. Vegetation on the site is weeds and native trees
 (see Figure 15). The adjacent properties to the north and south are medium density
 residential developments. A single-family home abuts the site on the west property line.
 On January 20, 2015, the Town Council approved a use permit, design review, and
 tentative map for a 16 unit condominium project on the site. The attached townhomes
 will vary between two- and three-story units, with units having either three or four
 bedrooms. Access to the project site will be from Casa Buena Drive. The project will
 provide three deed restricted affordable housing units, with one unit affordable to a very
 low income household, one unit affordable to a low income household, and one unit
 affordable to a moderate income household.

 Land use controls
 The Robin Drive property is designated Low Density Residential (0.2 to 6.0 dwelling
 units per acre) and Open Residential (up to 0.2 dwellings per acre). The site is in two
 “base” zoning districts and one overlay district. The northern 7 acres of the property are
 zoned R-1 Medium Density Residential, which would permit up to 40 units at the upper
 end of the R-1 density range. However, the property is also zoned Hillside Land Capacity
 (HLC), an overlay district that limits the number of units with a slope/density formula.
 The HLC formula is shown in Table 50 below. The formula applies a sliding scale – the
 capacity factor – to portions of the gross site area by slope category. The result is a net
 site area, which is then used to calculate the density yield for the property using the
 development standard for the underlying base zoning district. Data for the northern 7
 acres (325,920 sf) of the Robin Drive property is entered into the formula in italics.

 district is 1 unit per five acres, and the minimum lot size is 1 acre. Both the base and the
 overlay districts permit at least one unit per parcel irrespective of lot size or slope.
 Accordingly the southern portion of the Robin Drive parcel will yield 1 single-family
 detached market rate unit. The 8.17 acres of the southern portion of the Robin Drive

 Housing Element Implementation Program H-2.6.b states that second units shall be
 required for at least 50% of the market rate units approved for development on the
 Robin Drive property. The slope density formula does not limit second units, and second
 units are allowed by right in both the R-1 and R-1-C districts. Accordingly, zoning would
 permit 8 second units in addition to 16 market rate homes permitted pursuant to the
 general plan density zoning for the property.
 Site improvement requirements
 The principal required site improvement is grading to accommodate individual building
 pads and access driveways. Considering the slopes on the property, the potential lots
 sizes described above and the ease of access provided by the existing roadway, grading
 will not be a significant engineering challenge.
 Environmental constraints
 There is no environmental determination available for this property; however, site
 inspections reveal the presence of oak trees near the center of the property that may
 require mitigation when development is proposed. Potential mitigation measures include
 reducing the number of housing units below the number permitted by zoning, adjusting
 lot lines to and the location of building pads to minimize tree loss, and/or replacing trees
 that are removed to accommodate construction.
 Realistic development capacity at the Robin Drive site
 From 2000 through 2013, 10 single-family detached homes were built in Corte Madera
 and 13 second units were approved. A project of single-family detached homes and
 second units at the Robin Drive site would be consistent with recent development
 trends, especially now that single family sales and prices have rebounded to pre-
 recession levels. However, the need to avoid or mitigate potential tree loss at the site
 could reduce the number of housing units that could be developed. Assuming that tree
 loss would be reduced by the elimination of one house lot in addition to the other

 Availability of water, sewer and other facilities
 The Marin Municipal Water District (MMWD) supplies water to all properties in Corte
 Madera. The MMWD has indicated there is adequate water supply to accommodate the
 growth projected under the Town’ updated General Plan, adopted in April 2009. The EIR
 for the 2009 General Plan found that the district currently has water supply shortages
 for multiple dry years. In 2009, the District certified an environmental impact report for
 a desalination plant to supplement water supplies in drought conditions. However, in
 August of 2010, the District adopted Ordinance 420 requiring a majority vote by District
 voters prior to approval of financing or construction of a desalination facility. Water
 distribution lines are located at or nearby all of the parcels listed in the Available Land
 Inventory.
 Sanitary District No. 2 of Marin County, a member of the Central Marin Sanitation
 Agency (CMSA) provides wastewater services to the Town of Corte Madera. CMSA owns
 and operates the CMSA Wastewater Treatment Plan, which treats sewage from member
 districts. The EIR for the Town’s 2009 General Plan determined that Sanitary District No.
 2 and CMSA have the capacity to service all of the growth that is projected through the
 year 2025 for Corte Madera. Sewer lines are located at or nearby all of the parcels listed
 in the Available Land Inventory.
 The 2009 General Plan EIR determined that solid waste services and electrical, natural
 gas, and telephone services are available to accommodate the growth projected for the
 Town through the year 2025.

 Chapter 727, statues of 2005, requires local governments to provide a copy of the
 adopted housing element to water and sewer providers. In addition, water and sewer
 providers must grant priority for service allocations to proposed developments that
 include housing units affordable to lower-income households. Chapter 727 also requires
 cities and counties to immediately deliver the adopted housing elements of the local
 general plan and any amendments to water and sewer service providers within a month
 after adoption. Appendix E provides draft letters the Marin Municipal Water District and
 the Central Marin Sanitation Agency transmitting copies of this Housing Element. The
 transmittal letters explain Corte Madera’s regional housing need allocation and other
 appropriate housing information.
 3.3 MEETING RHNA OBJECTIVES
 The Town will meet its share of the regional housing need by implementing a variety of
 strategies. The primary method for addressing the adequate sites requirement will be
 through the identification of available vacant and non-vacant sites that are suitable and
 appropriately zoned and that are likely to develop within the planning period. A
 secondary method of addressing the adequate sites requirement is through an inventory
 of dwellings that were approved or under construction since January 1, 2014, the
 beginning of the new planning period for compliance with RHNA.
 Residential development between January 2014 and December 2014
 Table 51 lists units under construction or approved since January 1, 2014, showing
 progress in meeting the 2014-2022 regional housing needs. The 180 units listed at Tam
 Ridge Residences are all multifamily units; 18 of these units are required to be deed-
 restricted at the affordability levels shown in Table 51. The rental prices of these units
 are subject to a recorded 55-year agreement between the owner and the Town that
 preserves affordability at these income levels. In addition, three single family homes
 have been issued building permits and one second unit has been developed.

      Capacity for lower-income housing
 Site #1 , identified in the inventory as having the greatest potential to accommodate
 housing affordable to lower-income households, allows densities of at least 20 units per
 acre. Per Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B) the Town’s zoning is consistent
 with the 20 dwelling unit per acre standard for suburban jurisdictions and is therefore
 appropriate to accommodate housing for lower-income households. The realistic

 capacity of Site #1 is 20 units, which exceeds the Town’s remaining need of 18 lower-
 income units.
     Second units
 In 2004, in compliance with Government Code Section 65852.2, the Town amended the
 Zoning Ordinance to allow second units by right in all single-family residential districts.
 Planning and Building Department staff approve applications for second units that
 comply with second unit regulations (see box at right). The approval process usually
 takes four weeks.
 The Town approved 13 second units between 1999 and 2013. Ten of the 13 second
 units were approved after the Town updated the Second Unit Ordinance in 2004.
 Between 2004 and 2013, the Town approved an average of one second unit permit per
 year. Based on this pattern and local housing demand and development trends, the
 Town projects 8 second units will be approved on scattered sites during the current
 planning period. This is in addition to the realistic unit capacity of 8 second units on the
 Robin Drive property, Site #3 in the Available
 Land Inventory (Table 47).

 In 2012, the County of Marin mailed surveys to 257 second unit owners in the
 unincorporated area of Marin County. Based on a 37 percent response rate, the survey
 found that 80 percent of second units are being rented, with rents ranging from $0 to
 $4,250. Approximately 22 percent of the units have no or reduced rent charged because
 a relative, friend or employee lives in the unit. Data from the survey revealed that
 affordability levels had remained fairly constant since 2008, as follows:
     •    6% as very low income (vs. 8% in 2008)
     •    50% as low income (vs. 51% in 2008)
     •    20% as moderate income (vs. 29% in 2008)
     •    22% as above moderate income (vs. 9% in 2008)
 Similarly, the City of Novato conducted a second unit survey in 2012. Novato’s survey
 determined that 66 percent of the second units were affordable to very low income
 households and 34 percent were affordable to low income households.
 A recent review of Craigslist found that 40 percent of asking rents for second units in
 central Marin are affordable to low income households and 60 percent are affordable to
 moderate income households. It is important to note that this sample does not reflect
 units that are charged no or reduced rent because they are occupied by friends,
 relatives, or employees.
 Based on the affordability data in the Marin Countywide Housing Element Workbook and
 the updated second unit surveys, the Town projects affordability levels for new second
 units will be as follows: one-third affordable to very low income households, one-third
 affordable to low-income households, and one-third affordable to moderate income
 households.
     Adequate sites
 As demonstrated in Table 53, the Town of Corte Madera has sufficient sites that are
 currently zoned to accommodate the unmet RHNA need of 29 units. A total of 78 units
 can be accommodated on sites identified in Table 53. Site #1, which is zoned for high
 density development, has capacity that exceeds the unmet need for units affordable to
 lower income households.

     Zoning for a Variety of Housing Types
 Housing Element Law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate the availability of sites,
 with appropriate zoning, that will encourage and facilitate a variety of housing types
 including multi-family rental housing, factory built housing, mobile homes, single room
 occupancy units, housing for agricultural employees, supportive housing, transitional
 housing, and emergency shelters. Table 54 summarizes the housing types currently
 permitted in each of Corte Madera’s residential zoning districts.
 Second Units
 Second units are allowed by right in all single family zoning districts (see page 70 above
 for a description of the Town’s second unit regulations).
 Multi-Family Rental Housing
 Multi-family rentals are allowed by right in the R-2 district and in the Town’s four
 affordable housing overlay districts. The R-2 district is a relatively standard, medium
 density zoning district that allows up to 10.9 units per acre, with additional density
 permitted for deed restricted senior housing. Development standards such as setbacks,
 coverage allowances, and height restrictions have not been a barrier to development in
 the R-2 zone. Residential development in the R-2 zoning district is approved through the
 design review permitting process.
 The affordable housing overlay districts (the AHO, AHE-A, AHE-B, AHMU, and MUGD
 districts) provide strong incentives for both market rate and affordable housing. In each
 of these districts, the “base” density is set by the underlying district. The overlay
 districts allow density at 25 units per acre in return for providing affordable housing. In
 the AHO and AHE-B districts, 100% of the units must be affordable to qualify for the
 higher density. The AHE-A and AHMU districts specify that 50% of the units will be
 affordable in return for the 25 units per acre density. The AHMU also offers a
 commercial FAR bonus of up to 300% in return for affordable housing. The parking and

 site development standards are reduced, relative to lower density districts, as a further
 incentive for affordable housing development. Bonuses for affordable housing are
 allowed up to a maximum density of 33.75 units per acre in all of the affordable housing
 overlay zones. The MUGD district specifies that 10% of the units will be affordable in
 return for a density of 40 units per acre.

 Factory Built Housing and Mobile Homes
 The Town Zoning Ordinance does not specify a permit process or development
 standards for manufactured housing or mobile homes. Accordingly, the Town applies the
Town of Corte Madera Housing Element                                                                             66

 same development standards and design review process to manufactured housing and
 mobile homes as it uses for stick-built single-family detached housing.
 The California Government Code requires that the siting and permit process for
 manufactured housing must be regulated in the same manner as a conventional or stick-
 built structure. Specifically, Government Code Section 65852.3(a) requires that, with the
 exception of architectural requirements, a local government shall only subject
 manufactured homes (mobilehomes and other factory built housing) to the same
 development standards to which a conventional single-family residential dwelling on the
 same lot would be subject, including, but not limited to, building setback standards, side
 and rear yard requirements, standards for enclosures, access, and vehicle parking,
 aesthetic requirements, and minimum square footage requirements. A program has
 been added to the Housing Element to add the term “manufactured housing” to the
 Zoning Ordinance and to specify development standards to bring the ordinance into
 greater conformity with State law.
 Single-Room Occupancy Units
 Single room occupancy units (SROs) are small, one-room units intended for occupancy
 by one person. SROs are usually in hotels, and they are distinct from efficiency or studio
 units that include a kitchen and bathroom. Currently, the Corte Madera Zoning
 Ordinance does not include specific standards for SROs. This Housing Element includes a
 program to add a definition and standards to the Zoning Ordinance that would regulate
 SROs in the same manner as hotels.
 Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing
 Effective January 1, 2008, SB 2 (Chapter 633, Statutes of 2007) requires every California
 town, city, and county to engage in a detailed analysis of emergency shelters and
 transitional and supportive housing in their next Housing Element revision, regulates
 zoning for these facilities, and broadens the scope of the Housing Accountability Act to
 include emergency shelters as well as supportive and transitional housing.
 Transitional housing is a type of housing used to facilitate the movement of homeless
 individuals and families to permanent housing. A homeless person may live in a
 transitional apartment for a predetermined period of time while receiving supportive
 services that enable independent living. Every locality must identify zones that will allow
 the development of transitional housing. Supportive housing is permanent rental
 housing linked to a range of support services designed to enable residents to maintain
 stable housing and lead fuller lives. Typically, supportive housing is targeted to people
 who have risk factors such as homelessness, or health challenges such as mental illness
 or substance addiction.
 The Corte Madera Zoning Ordinance treats transitional and supportive housing in the
 same manner as other residential uses. The ordinance does not require transitional or
 supportive housing to obtain permits or approvals other than those required for any
 other residential development. In January 2015, the Town adopted a Zoning Code
 amendment to include transitional and supportive housing to the definitions of single-
 family dwelling, multiple dwelling, and multiple house, thereby ensuring that supportive

                                    3.0 SITES INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS
 housing and transitional housing are treated as residential uses subject to the same
 restrictions as residential dwellings of the same type in the same zoning district.
 Homeless Shelters
 Government Code Section 65583(a)(4) requires jurisdictions to accommodate at least
 one year-round emergency shelter with the capacity to provide for the unmet needs of
 homeless individuals. Effective January 1, 2008, Senate Bill 2 amended State Housing
 Element law to require jurisdictions to allow emergency shelters without discretionary
 approvals such as use permits.
 In January 2015, the Town adopted a Zoning Code amendment to allow emergency
 shelters as a permitted use in the P/SP Public and Semi-Public Facilities District, subject
 to operational standards permitted by State law including parking requirements, on-site
 management and security requirements, location of waiting/intake areas, proximity to
 other shelters, lighting, and length of stay. The maximum number of beds or clients
 permitted to be served in an emergency shelter is 13. As documented in section 2.0
 Housing Needs Analysis of this Housing Element, there is an existing unmet need for 6
 emergency shelter beds in Corte Madera.
 SB 2 requires that the Housing Element analyze the compatibility and suitability of
 zoning districts proposed for homeless shelters. The Housing Element must demonstrate
 that a zone permitting homeless shelters by right has sufficient capacity to
 accommodate the need and that it has a realistic potential for development or reuse
 opportunities in the planning period. The analysis of capacity must also consider physical
 features and location.
 The P/SP Public and Semipublic Facilities District applies to all public and semipublic
 facilities and public service installations except flood control and drainage facilities, and
 parks, open space and natural habitat districts. Uses allowed in the P/SP district include
 public schools; town, county, state, and federal facilities; places of religious assembly;
 and eleemosynary institutions and facilities. A total of 160.2 acres are zoned P/SP in
 Corte Madera. Existing uses in the P/SP districts are consistent with the range of allowed
 uses, including public and private schools, Town Hall, a public library, and a church.
 P/SP zoning is scattered throughout the town. Ten sites are zoned P/SP, ranging in size
 from 1.1 acres to 10.4 acres.
 The Town anticipates that homeless shelters would develop in the P/SP district by
 reusing existing structures rather than constructing new buildings. However, in the
 event that new construction is needed to develop a homeless shelter, the development
 standards for the P/SP district would not be a constraint. There is no FAR, coverage, or
 frontage standard for the P/SP district. Rather, the Zoning Ordinance provides that the
 site area and frontage requirements shall be “sufficient and appropriate for the intended
 use” as determined by the design review approval. The setback standards are the same
 as the closest residential district. Using this standard, the front setback is 20 feet, the
 side yard requirement is 6 feet, and the rear yard setback would be 25 feet. These
 setbacks would not be a significant constraint to development on any of the three
 potential shelter sites, which range from one-half to 2.7 acres in size.
 The P/SP district is judged to be compatible and suitable for a homeless shelter because
 it is intended for public service and assembly. Properties with P/SP zoning are designed

 to have an attractive, healthy, and positive environment and avoid the potential adverse
 effects or stigma that may be associated with industrial or commercial zoning districts.
 In all but one case, P/SP-zoned properties are located on or within one block of an
 arterial street, assuring convenient vehicle and pedestrian access. The exception is the
 Granada School site, which is located two blocks from an arterial street. All of the P/SP
 properties are adjacent to residential neighborhoods. None of the P/SP properties is
 vacant, although a number could be converted to emergency shelter use.
 Housing for Employees and Agricultural Workers
 The housing needs analysis in this Housing Element found that there are no
 farmworkers or agricultural employment in Corte Madera. Accordingly, the Town has not
 identified a need for specialized farmworker housing beyond overall programs for
 housing affordability.
 The Town complies with the Employee Housing Act. Pursuant to Health and Safety
 Code Section 17021.5, the Town deems any employee housing providing
 accommodations for six or fewer employees as a single family structure. No conditional
 use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance is required of employee housing
 serving six or fewer employees that is not required of a single family dwelling in the
 same zone.

4.1       OVERVIEW
The Housing Element must identify and analyze potential and actual governmental
constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing for all income
levels, including housing for persons with disabilities. The analysis must identify the specific
standards and processes and evaluate their impact, including cumulatively, on the supply
and affordability of housing. The analysis must determine whether local regulatory standards
pose an actual constraint and must also demonstrate local efforts to remove constraints that
hinder a jurisdiction from meeting its housing needs. The Housing Element must analyze
non-governmental constraints as well.
4.2       GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Corte Madera’s regulatory standards assure procedural consistency, promote a cohesive built
environment, and protect the long-term health, safety, and welfare of the community.
However, regulations can conflict with policies and constrain the development of affordable
housing. The following analysis assesses the Town’s land use regulations, procedures, and
fees to identify possible conflicts.
     General Plan Land Use Element
The General Plan Land Use Element provides five residential land use designations, which
are summarized in Table 55 below.

Most land designated for residential development in Corte Madera has been built upon. Most
of the remaining vacant residential parcels are constrained by steep slopes that increase
development costs and limit development potential. In response to the continuing need to
develop housing, the Town adopted four mixed-use designations in the 2009 General Plan
that are intended to encourage residential development in commercial areas. Mixed-use land
use designations are shown in Table 56. Each of these designations is designed to provide
incentives for redevelopment projects that include affordable housing. These designations
will be implemented with new zoning districts that will be developed as a follow-up to
adopting the 2009 General Plan. The Mixed-Use Region Serving designation will be
implemented with planned development zoning or the AHMU overlay. The Mixed-Use
Gateway designation was put into effect with a single-site zoning district developed solely for
the former WinCup property. AHO zoning was applied to the area designated Mixed-Use, Old

In addition to the mixed-use land use designations, the Town has adopted policies in the
Land Use Element of the General Plan to further encourage in-fill and mixed-use
development in the commercial areas of the community, especially along the Highway 101
corridor that provides access to transit routes and the freeway. The Town does not have
growth controls or prohibitions against multifamily in the General Plan or in any other part of
its regulatory system. The Town Council adopted a temporary moratorium on the issuance of
land use entitlements for a relatively small area designated the Tamal Vista East Corridor on
October 7, 2014. The moratorium is in effect through October 7, 2015. The area is bounded
by Madera Boulevard, Tamal Vista Boulevard, Wornum Drive and Highway 101. It does not
include any of the sites listed in the Available Land Inventory on Table 47.
The General Plan provides a comprehensive program, including mixed-use land use
designations, to promote housing development at all income ranges. The General Plan is not
a constraint to housing development.
     Residential Development Standards
The Town of Corte Madera zoning ordinance includes five “base” low- and medium-density
residential districts with typical suburban development standards and four high-density
overlay districts that are designed to encourage affordable housing. The development
standards for the base residential districts and the affordable housing overlay districts are
summarized in Table 57 on the following page.

Low density residential districts
Description. The R-1-A, R-1-B, and R-1-C districts regulate steeply sloped and potentially
geologically unstable areas of the community. These single-family districts allow one home
per parcel; second units are allowed by right. Lot size is the controlling standard in these
districts, which serves to minimize grading for home sites, roads, and utilities by requiring
larger lots for steeper topography. The R-1-C district applies to the steepest areas of the
town, requiring a five-acre minimum lot size. The R-1-B and R-1-A districts address
progressively less steep parcels and permit smaller lot sizes at 1 acre and 20,000 s.f.
respectively. The lot width and setback standards are designed to minimize grading,
drainage impacts, and tree loss, while maintaining a separation between homes that is
characteristic of these hillside neighborhoods. The R-1 district comprises most of the single-
family neighborhoods in Corte Madera, including all of the “flat land” neighborhoods and
portions of the older hillside residential areas. The R-1 district is designed to maintain the
low-density character of these areas, and the development standards are structured
accordingly. Minimum lot sizes are 7,500 square feet, and front side and rear yard setbacks
are 20, 6, and 25 feet respectively.
The R-1 and the R-1-A, -B, and -C districts share the same FAR formula, which ranges from
0.6 for properties smaller than 5,000 square feet to 0.4 for parcels larger than 7,500 square
feet. All of the zoning districts in the R-1 series have a height limit of 30 feet. Similarly, all of
the R-1 series require 2 parking spaces per dwelling unit.
Analysis. R-1 and the R-1-A, -B, and -C districts development standards are analyzed below:
    •    Building height. Corte Madera’s standard for measuring height is generous. "Building
         height” is defined as the vertical distance from the finished grade to the highest
         point of the structure. Maximum height is measured from finished grade to an
         imaginary plane located the allowed number of feet above and parallel to the
         finished grade. Thus, the height envelope “flexes” with the finished grade of the
         property, thereby assuring that the 30-foot height limit allows at least two stories
         can be built on any parcel. The method for measuring height also allows portions of
         building to be below grade without a height penalty, and places no limits on the
         number of levels that may be allowed. For this reason, it is possible to build three
         story homes on flat lots in the low-density districts, and four-level houses have been
         approved and developed on sloped lots.
    •    Minimum Lot width. The 30-feet minimum lot width in the R-1 and R-1-A districts
         allows maximum flexibility in lot configuration, and in this sense minimizes one of the
         typical obstacles to housing development. The larger minimum widths required for
         the R-1-B and R-1-C districts – 50 and 100 feet respectively – do not act as
         constraints in these districts due to the large lot sizes (1 and 5 acres). For example,
         if a property owner chose to create a minimum-size parcel in the R-1-C with the
         minimum frontage, the parcel could be more than 2,175 feet deep. This example
         demonstrates that the lot-width requirement in the R-1-C is not unduly restrictive.
         The same analysis applies to the R-1-B lot width standard, with the same result.
    •    FAR. The floor area ratio standard ranges from .6 for parcels of 4,600 square feet or
         less, to a maximum of .4 for lots of 7,700 square feet or larger. Thus, for example, a
         2,760 square foot home can be built on a 4,600 square foot parcel. While .4 is the
         maximum FAR for larger lots, there is no maximum home size. The generous FAR for
         small lots promotes development in the pre-1920’s neighborhoods, where parcels
         tend to be smaller, and the lack of a maximum home size standard allows builders to
Town of Corte Madera Housing Element                                                                 73

                                               4.0 HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
         meet market expectations on the larger hillside lots. For these reasons, the FAR
         standard is not a constraint on development.
    •    Setbacks. The standard parcel in the R-1 district measures 75 feet wide by 100 feet
         deep. When front, rear and side setbacks are subtracted, 3,465 square feet of lot
         area remains available to accommodate a footprint of up to 2,250 square feet as
         allowed by the 30% coverage factor. Thus, the two dimensional development
         envelope created by the R-1 setbacks is substantially larger than needed for the
         building foundation, allowing the builder flexibility in locating and configuring the
         home, and avoiding artificial, and possibly costly, constraints. The R-1 district
         recognizes that many parcels in the district are substandard size and allows reduced
         front and side yard setbacks for lots that have less than the minimum lot area. As
         another example, a minimum size, square lot (approximately 141 feet wide by 141
         feet deep) in the R-1-A district has an envelope slightly larger than 9,800 square feet
         that can easily accommodate the 5,000 square foot building footprint allowed by the
         35% coverage limit. Narrower lots result in larger envelopes because they have the
         effect of minimizing the lot area devoted to the front and rear yard setbacks, which
         are proportionately larger than the side yard setbacks. In the unlikely situation that
         an otherwise conforming R-1-A lot were so wide that it resulted in an envelope too
         small to accommodate the maximum coverage standard, the property would qualify
         for a variance. As in the R-1 district, the R-1-A setback standards create a generous
         envelope for construction and are not a constraint on housing development. The
         R-1-B and - C setbacks are slightly larger than the R-1-A requirements, but due to
         the substantially larger lot sizes (1 and 5 acres) the resulting development envelope
         is proportionally larger.
    •    Minimum lot area. As discussed above, lot size standards are set by hillside
         conditions in the case of the R-1-A, -B, and –C districts, and by the prevailing
         neighborhood development patterns in the R-1 district. However, the zoning
         ordinance recognizes the existence of many substandard size lots, and provides that
         development is permitted on all lots irrespective of parcel size. The ordinance also
         states that development on substandard size lots shall not be considered “legal
         nonconforming” by virtue of lot size, thereby avoiding the need for use permits to
         replace a damaged or destroyed building on a non-conforming lot. Further, the R-1
         district has reduced setback and coverage standards for substandard size lots.
    •    Lot coverage ranges from 35% for substandard sized lots in the R-1 to 15% in the
         R-1-B district. This range is appropriate for the minimum lot sizes of the respective
         districts and is not a constraint on housing development. For example, the coverage
         standard allows a 1,750 square foot building footprint on a 5,000 square foot lot in
         the R-1 district to accommodate up to 2,350 square feet of building floor area. In the
         R-1-B district, the maximum lot coverage on a standard size lot is 6,524 square feet.
         Based on these examples, the coverage standards are not unduly restrictive. In the
         R-1-C district, coverage is determined based on site characteristics. These properties
         are generally the steepest lots in the community and therefore need to be evaluated
         for coverage on a case-by-case basis, due to soil conditions and the possible need to
         correct landslide conditions.
Conclusions. The R-1 and the R-1-A, -B, and -C development standards have not constrained
housing construction in Corte Madera, nor have they been a barrier to the development of
affordable housing. Existing densities generally match General Plan land use designations,
and the larger lot sizes of the R-1-A, -B, and -C districts are necessary due to hillside
conditions. In the past decade, the Town approved 10 single-family homes and 12 second
units in the R-1 and the R-1-A, -B, and -C districts. The cumulative effect of the low-density

housing regulations has been to permit the development of 22 homes, by right, in the past
decade. More the 50% of these homes were affordable second units.
Medium density residential district
Description. The R-2 district is Corte Madera’s “base” multi-family zoning district. The R-2
district is distributed throughout the flat areas of the community. The minimum lot size is
8,000 square feet, with 4,000 square feet required per dwelling unit. This formula equates to
a density of 10.9 units per acre, however, densities up to 21.75 units per acre are allowed
for senior housing. The R-2 district allows multiple dwellings (structures with 2 or more units
for rent or for lease) by right with no requirement for a use permit and allows multiple
houses (structures with 2 or more units for sale) with a conditional use permit. Setback and
height standards in the R-2 zoning district match those in the R-1 district. The R-2 district
has a usable open space standard of 300 s.f. per unit. There is no FAR formula for the R-2
zoning district. Parking in the R-2 district is based on the number of bedrooms in each
dwelling unit, with 1.5 spaces required for an efficiency or single bedroom unit, and 2 spaces
required for each unit with more than 1 bedroom. One guest parking space must be
provided for every 10 units.
Analysis. Essential elements of the R-2 development standards are assessed below:
    •    Building height, lot width, setbacks, and coverage. These development standards
         match the corresponding R-1 standards. As discussed above in the analysis of the R-
         1 standards, the definition and method for measuring height allow for three-story
         buildings. The lot width and setback standards are minimal and do not act as
         constraints. The 35% coverage standard allows adequate space to accommodate
         required parking and landscaping without unduly restricting the potential
         development yield.
    •    Minimum lot area. The requirement for an 8,000 square foot minimum lot size does
         not constrain housing development because it is consistent with the lotting patterns
         in the areas where the R-2 district is applied. Also, the zoning ordinance permits
         development of substandard lots without the requirement for a variance from the lot
         area standard.
    •    Lot area per dwelling unit. The requirement for 4,000 square feet of lot per unit
         results in a density range of up to 10.9 units per acre. The R-2 standards facilitate
         senior housing by allowing 2,000 square feet of lot area for age-restricted housing.
Conclusions. The R-2 standards are minimal and do not constrain housing development.
There are currently two applications for developments that include affordable housing in the
R-2 district.
Overlay districts
Description. While the base residential districts are not an obstacle to housing development,
the lack of vacant residentially zoned property zoned for medium- and high-density housing
is a significant impediment. In response to this problem, in 2003 the Town amended the
zoning ordinance to include four housing overlay districts (see Table 57) as part of the
implementation program for the 2002 Housing Element. The AHO, AHE-A, AHE-B, and AHMU
districts allow densities at 25 units per acre by right without the requirement for a use
permit and provide other incentives to redevelop properties for affordable housing. In AHE-A
districts, 50% of the units must be affordable to qualify for the increased density allowance.
The affordability requirement in the AHE-B district is 100% to qualify for the 25 unit per acre
Town of Corte Madera Housing Element                                                           75

                                               4.0 HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
density standard. The AHO and AHMU districts are designed to overlay commercial districts.
The AHMU district allows 25 units per acre in return for 50% of the units being affordable.
The AHO district is similar to the AHMU, except that it requires 100% affordability.
In 2011, the Town amended the zoning ordinance to include a Mixed Use Gateway Overlay
(MUGD) district. The MUGD district allows 40 units per acre in return for 10% of the units
being affordable.
Analysis. Relevant development standards for the overlay districts are discussed below:
    •    Base districts. The AHO district applies to the Old Corte Madera Square
         neighborhood, where the base zoning is R-2 Low Density Multiple Dwelling and C-1
         Local Shopping. Applying the AHO establishes a density standard to properties zoned
         C-1 where there is currently no density standard, and more than doubles the density
         standard in the R-2 district. The AHE-A and -B districts can be used to overlay the R-
         2 district outside the Old Corte Madera Square area, thereby more than doubling the
         allowed residential density in return for providing affordable housing. The AHMU
         district may be placed over the C-1, C-2 and C-4 commercial districts. The effect is to
         allow high-density housing by right without the requirement for a use permit in
         commercial districts that otherwise require a use permit for housing for which there
         is no density standard. The overlay allows mixed use multifamily residential and
         local serving commercial uses.
    •    Building height. The AHO limits building height to 30 feet. This effectively limits
         housing to two stories, which is a necessary constraint to preserve the historic
         character of the Old Corte Madera Square neighborhood. The AHE and the AHMU
         districts allow building heights up to 38 feet, which is generally considered an
         incentive for higher densities and affordable housing. The MUGD district allows
         building heights of 38 feet along the street frontage and 48 feet on inner portions of
         the lot.
    •    FAR. The AHO, AHE and MUGD districts do not regulate floor area ratios. The AHMU
         allows a 1.0 FAR for commercial development in return for providing affordable
         housing. This is a significant increase over the .34 FAR allowed by the base districts.
    •    Setbacks. In the AHO, the front set back is the same as the base district – 20 feet in
         the case of the R-2 and 10 feet for the C-1 district. The purpose of this standard is to
         maintain the character of the street frontage in Old Corte Madera Square. The AHO
         requires 5-foot setbacks for the side and rear yards, which is considered a minimum
         standard necessary for access. The AHE-A and -B districts have the same front, side,
         and rear yard setbacks as the R-2 district; historically, these setbacks have not
         constrained high-density housing in Corte Madera. The AHMU overlay has the same
         setbacks as AHO district. The front setbacks are set by the base district in order to
         preserve the existing street frontage patterns. The requirement for 5-foot side and
         rear yard setbacks is necessary for pedestrian access. The MUGD district has flexible
         setbacks.
    •    Minimum lot area. With the exception of the MUGD district, the overlay districts do
         not have minimum lot area standards, thereby avoiding a potential constraint on
         housing development. The MUGD district has a minimum lot area of one acre.
    •    Lot coverage. Lot coverage for the AHO overlay is set by the base districts, which
         have a 35% coverage standard in the case of the R-2, and no coverage limits in the
         C-1 base district. The AHO relies on the base districts in order to maintain the design
         character of the Old Corte Madera Square neighborhood, where it is applied. The
         AHE districts have the same 35% coverage requirement as the R-2 base district, so
Town of Corte Madera Housing Element                                                             76

                                              4.0 HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
         as to be consistent with adjacent R-2 properties where the overlay may not be in
         effect. The coverage standard for the AHMU is set by the underlying base districts,
         which have no coverage standards. The MUGD district has no lot coverage standard.
Conclusions. The overlay districts promote high density and affordable housing with a variety
of incentives, including increased densities, density bonuses in excess of state density bonus
law requirements, increased height limits at 38 to 48 feet, a commercial FAR bonus in the
AHMU, reduced setbacks in the AHO and AHMU, and reduced parking and open space
requirements in all five overlay districts. To date, two projects have used standards in the
overlay districts as a basis for developing affordable housing. The 79-unit San Clemente
Place project was developed in the AHMU district, and the 180-unit Tam Ridge Residences
project was developed in the MUGD district. This experience has shown that the
development standards in the overlay districts are an effective incentive for affordable
housing.
Neither the base residential districts nor the affordable housing overlay districts have
restrictions or require use permits for multifamily rental housing, factory-built housing,
mobile homes, supportive housing or transitional housing. The R-2 district and the overlay
districts allow multifamily rental housing by right without the requirement for a use permit.
In order to clarify current practice, the Housing Element includes a program to add
definitions of factory-built housing and mobile homes to the Zoning Ordinance as permitted
uses in the base residential, and affordable housing overlay districts.
     Non-Residential Development Standards for Commercial Districts
     Permitting Residential Uses
Corte Madera has 10 non-residential zoning districts. Two non-residential districts, the C-1
and C-3 commercial districts, allow housing, subject to approval of a conditional use permit.
Program H-2.9.a will add a Mixed-Use Zone to the Zoning Ordinance to establish clear and
objective development standards that will facilitate mixed use in areas that are currently
zoned C-1 and C-3.
     Affordable Housing Ordinance
Adopted in 2003, the Corte Madera Zoning Ordinance sets inclusionary housing requirements
for residential development projects (CMC 18.24.120 – Affordable Housing). Development
projects that include from 1 to 9 units are required to provide 1 unit affordable to a lower
income household. As an alternative, developers of these smaller projects may pay an in-lieu
fee that is based on the difference between the cost of constructing an affordable unit and
what a low-income family of three can afford. For purposes of the calculation, the size of the
unit is set at 1,500 square feet and the cost of construction at $125 per square feet, for a
total construction cost of $187,500. In 2014, the in-lieu fee was determined to be $36,836
per unit. This fee is significantly lower than what other Marin jurisdictions charge. Marin
County, for example, charged $232,020 per unit in 2014, while Tiburon charged $405,000
per unit.        Given that Corte Madera’s fee is among the lowest in Marin County, the
affordable housing in-lieu fee is not a constraint on development.
Projects that include 10 or more dwelling units must include affordable units at the following
ratios:
     •   5% of the units for very low-income households;
     •   10% of the units for low-income households;

     •    10% of the units for moderate-income households.
Projects that meet the inclusionary ordinance are entitled to a density bonus in accordance
with State law. The inclusionary ordinance does not allow projects with 10 or more units to
pay the in-lieu fee or to provide the required affordable units off-site. Projects in the
affordable housing overlay zones are exempt from the ordinance because by definition they
provide affordable housing at ratios in excess of the inclusionary requirements.
As shown in Table 58, the Town’s inclusionary requirements for market-rate developments
with 10 or more units are higher than other jurisdictions in Marin County. Corte Madera
requires 25 percent of units to be affordable while most other jurisdictions require 15 to 20
percent affordable units. However, recent experience indicates that the inclusionary
affordable housing requirement is not constraining development. The proposed 16-unit
project at 1421 Casa Buena Drive (Site #2) provides an example. The Town’s inclusionary
requirement, in concert with a State density bonus, increased the number of units that could
be built on the site from 12 to 16 units. The inclusionary requirement, which is calculated on
the number of units before the density bonus is applied, requires three affordable units to be
built (one unit affordable to a very low income household, one unit for a low income
household, and one unit for a moderate income household). State density bonus law
provides a 27.5% density bonus for this project, allowing an additional four units to be built,
and thereby offsetting the increased cost of development. Based on this experience, there
appears to be no need to revise the inclusionary requirements to more closely align with that
of other communities. Nonetheless, Program H-2.12.b states the Town will monitor the
Inclusionary Ordinance throughout the planning period and consider adjusting the number
and/or percentage of required affordable units as necessary in order to achieve the Town’s
affordable housing goals without unduly impacting overall housing production and supply.

    Fees and Exactions
Development fees charged by the Town of Corte Madera fall into three categories:
    1. Processing fees for direct Town services.
    2. Development impact fees charged to finance the cost of capital improvements or
         mitigate project impacts.
    3. Fees collected by the Town for other governmental agencies.
Processing fees are collected when a development application is filed. The Town sets the
rate for application fees based on the cost to process the application, including the initial
receipt of the application materials, analysis and approval of the application, and post-
approval administration such as filing and inspections. Most application fees are charged on
a time and materials basis. In these cases, the applicant pays a deposit, and the Town
draws down on the deposit based on the number hours worked based on an hourly rate that
covers the salary of the employee performing the service and a fixed percentage for
overhead. Applications for services that require minimal review times are charged flat rates.
These rates are based on time studies that have determined the average processing time for
a particular service. Table 59 lists the processing fees for residential development. The Town
has received only two applications for General Plan amendments or rezonings in recent
years, due to the lack of vacant property, and these applications will be exceptions to the
rule for the foreseeable future. It is Town policy to consider waiver of processing fees for
affordable housing projects.
The Town of Corte Madera collects four impact fees, listed in Table 60 below, to mitigate the
effects of residential development projects on the local environment. The impact fee rates
were set based on nexus studies as required by the Mitigation Fee Act (Government Code
section 66000–66025).
New subdivisions are required to dedicate land for parks or pay an in-lieu fee pursuant to
the Quimby Act. The Park Dedication Ordinance sets a formula for the amount of land to be
dedicated for each new lot resulting from subdivision. Due to the small amount of vacant
land remaining for subdivision, a fee is collected in lieu of land dedication. The fee formula is
based on the appraised value of the property being subdivided.
The Town may waive impact fees for affordable housing projects. The Town waived the
Traffic impact fee for the San Clemente Place project.
The Town collects a connection fee for the Marin Municipal Water District and collects impact
fees for the Larkspur-Corte Madera and Reed school districts as listed in Table 61 below.
Compared to the fee information provided in the 2011 Housing element, only two fees have
increased. The sewer connection fee increased 13%, and the Larkspur-Corte Madera School
District impact fee increased 50%.

Table 62 lists the fees that would be collected for a single-family infill home and a 10-unit
multifamily apartment or condominium project. The single-family unit is assumed to be 3
bedrooms, with 2,400 s.f. of floor area on a 10,000 s.f. lot with a 400 s.f. garage at a
density of 2 units per acre and a construction valuation of $500,000. The multifamily project
is assumed to be ten 2-bedroom units, each with 1,200 s.f. of floor area, on a .5-acre parcel
with a construction valuation of $400,000 per unit.
The distribution of fees by type for a single family dwelling is shown in Figure 17. The water
connection fee, sewer connection fee, and school impact fee comprise about 54% of the
total fee cost. The Town’s Building Division collects the school impact and water connection
fees when building permits are issued and passes the proceeds to the respective school

districts and the Marin Municipal Water District. The Town does not have the authority to
waive or reduce them. The Town’s planning and building fees represent about 19% of the
total fee for a single family dwelling. As a matter of policy, the Town considers a waiver of
planning and building fees for affordable housing projects.

In 2009, the Marin Countywide Housing Workbook, a joint effort by Marin’s towns, cities,
and the county, surveyed development fees charged by each of the jurisdictions for a single
family home and for a 10-unit condominium project. Although the survey is dated, it
provides a good comparison of jurisdictions’ fees, as fees have not changed much over the
past five years. The assumptions for the size and value of these hypothetical projects are
the same as for the projects analyzed in Table 63. Within the jurisdictions that contributed
data, a single family home development is subject to average fees totaling $46,633. A ten-
unit condo development is subject to average fees totaling $321,071. These figures exclude
affordable housing fees.

Corte Madera’s residential development fees are in line with the fees charged by other
jurisdictions in Marin County. The fees for a single home that are attributable solely to the
Town (the “jurisdiction fees” in Figures 18 and 19) are approximately 3% higher than the
median for Marin communities and the county. However, the total development fees charged
by the Town for both the hypothetical single family home and the 10-unit condominium
project are below the median charged by Marin towns, cities and the county. Accordingly,
Corte Madera’s fees have not affected the Town’s competitiveness with neighboring
communities in terms of affordable housing.
Corte Madera’s second unit fee is $1,195, which is higher than most jurisdictions’ second
unit fees in Marin County. In order to encourage second unit development, Housing
Element Program H-2.15.c commits the Town to consider waiving or reducing the second
unit application fee and to work with special districts to reduce their impact fees.
The preceding analysis shows that the total development fee in Corte Madera represents
9.0% of the construction valuation of a single family home, and 7.5% of the value of a 10-
unit multifamily project. When the fees charged by other jurisdictions are discounted from
the totals, the Town’s fees represent about one half of the fee burden. Recognizing that,
while these costs are typical for the market area, the Town Council has readopted Housing
Element Policy H-2.10 Incentives for Affordable Housing Developments waiving Town fees
for affordable housing.
     Processing and Permit Procedures
The Town’s Zoning Ordinance specifies residential uses allowed in each district and the
required permits (see Table 53). Single-family homes are allowed in all of the “R” districts
and the affordable housing overlay districts without discretionary review, except design
review. Similarly, multifamily rental projects are allowed in the R-2 district and the affordable
housing overlay districts with design review. Conditional Use Permits are required for
housing in the C-1 and C-2 commercial districts and for multifamily for-sale projects in the R-
2 district.
The Planning Department has prepared information sheets for each permit type in an effort
to clarify the application process. Application forms for each permit type include a checklist
that guides property owners and their consultants through the process of preparing a
complete application. Permit procedures and standards are discussed below.
Permitted uses
Permitted uses are allowed without any type of permitting requirement, except Building
Permits if construction is involved. Residential care facilities are permitted uses pursuant to
California Health and Safety Code section 1502. Residential uses listed in Table 65 as
requiring a Design Review permit may be treated as permitted uses if they do not involve
significant exterior building modifications that would otherwise trigger Design Review. For
example, converting a single family home to a duplex in the R-2 district would be treated as
a permitted use if the exterior building modifications were modest.

Design Review Permits
A Design Review Permit is required in the “R” districts for any structure or addition larger
than 250 square feet or taller than 15 feet. Design Review Permits do not regulate or allow
residential uses per se. Rather, the design review process controls architecture and site
development including the following:
    •    Location of the structure on the site, especially in relation to adjoining sites in terms
         of view and privacy impacts.
    •    Grading and tree loss.
    •    Size and bulk of the proposed building in relation to the character of other buildings
         in the vicinity.
    •    Site planning, architectural, and landscaping details.
    •    Improvements to existing buildings and site features.
Design Review Permits may be approved at the staff level by the Zoning Administrator
without a public hearing or by the Planning Commission with a public hearing. Residential
remodeling projects that are confined to the first floor are generally reviewed by the Zoning
Administrator. Design Review applications for second story additions and new homes,
including multifamily projects, are approved by the Planning Commission.
The Design Review chapter of the Zoning Ordinance provides the following design
guidelines:
    •    Single story design is encouraged in all residential districts. This guideline has been
         superseded by policies in the Land Use Element of the 2009 General Plan. It will be
         revised in a project to update the Zoning Ordinance.
    •    In hillside areas, natural land forms and vegetation should be preserved to the
         maximum extent possible, natural materials and earth tone colors should be used,
         and grading should be minimized.
    •    In bay front areas, views are to be preserved by clustering development.
    •    On exposed hillsides, building design should follow the natural contours of the site.
    •    Landscaping should use native plants and drought-tolerant species.
    •    New utilities are to be underground.
    •    Senior housing proposals requesting density bonuses are reviewed for proximity to
         services, compatibility with the character of the surrounding neighborhood, ambient
         noise levels, parking, and pedestrian access.
The Planning Commission approves Design Review permit applications at public hearings.
Most Design Review applications are approved with a single hearing, and the Planning
Commission’s decision is final unless appealed to the Town Council. The Planning
Commission, or the Town Council on appeal, must make the following findings to approve a
Design Review Permit application:
    •    The application is consistent with the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance.

    •    The project will not unnecessarily remove trees or natural vegetation, and will
         preserve natural land forms.
    •    The project will not significantly affect views, privacy, and sunlight.
    •    The project is in scale and harmonious with development in the vicinity.
    •    Development materials and techniques are high quality.
    •    The structure(s), site plan, and landscaping have an internal sense of order.
    •    To the maximum extent feasible, the project would improve existing sites structures
         and landscaping and correct code violations.
    •    Signs are consistent with the character of building on site.
Second Unit Permits
Consistent with Government code Section 65852.2, second units are allowed in all of the “R”
districts as a permitted use. A ministerial Second Unit Permit approved by the Zoning
Administrator is required. Second Unit Permit applications that meet the second unit
regulations in the Zoning Ordinance are approved. Notice that an application is pending is
sent to surrounding properties, but there is no public hearing. The approval process usually
takes four weeks. A larger discussion of second units, including the second unit regulations,
can be found in Section 3.0, Sites Inventory and Analysis.
Use Permits
Housing may be allowed in the C-1 Local Shopping District and the C-3 Highway Commercial
District with a discretionary Conditional Use Permit approved by the Planning Commission.
Zoning Ordinance standards for the C-1 and C-3 districts allow “residential units in locations
and at densities determined by the Planning Commission to conform to the General Plan.”
The Town used this authority to approve the 118-unit Aegis senior assisted living complex at
the Paradise Shopping Center, which is zoned C-1 Local Shopping District.
The Planning Commission conducts public hearings to review applications for Use Permit for
housing in the C-1 or C-3 districts. After considering information in the application and
evidence presented at the hearing, the Planning Commission may approve a Use Permit if it
makes the following findings:
    •    The proposed location of the conditional use is consistent with the objectives of the
         Zoning Ordinance and the provisions of the applicable zoning district.
    •    The proposed location and the conditions under which the use would be operated
         will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare.
    •    The proposed conditional use will comply with the General Plan and with the
         applicable Zoning Ordinance regulations.
In 2009, the Town updated the General Plan to revise the land use designations that support
the C-1 and C-3 zoning districts. The 2009 Plan applies the Mixed-Use: Old Corte Madera
Square designation to a C-1 commercial area on the west side of town. This designation
allows housing at up to 25.0 dwelling units per acre. Similarly, the 2009 General Plan
provides a Mixed-Use Commercial designation subject to a mixed use zoning district that has
yet to be developed by the Town.

Variance Procedure
The Corte Madera Zoning Ordinance includes a variance procedure to allow development on
properties that have special circumstances such that literal enforcement of the zoning
regulations would cause practical difficulties or hardships that would be inconsistent with the
intent of the ordinance and the General Plan. In Corte Madera, most variance applications
are approved by the Zoning Administrator without a public hearing. A limited number of
variance applications are reviewed by the Planning Commission at public hearings, usually in
tandem with design review applications. The Zoning Administrator and the Planning
Commission may grant variances, subject to making the following findings:
    •    There are special circumstances that apply to the property, including size, shape,
         topography, location or surroundings that do not apply to other properties with the
         same zoning.
    •    Due to the special circumstances, strict application of the zoning regulations would
         result in practical difficulty that would deprive the property of privileges available to
         other properties in the same zoning classification.
    •    The variance would not constitute a special privilege.
    •    Granting the variance would not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to
         property in the vicinity.
    •    The variance would be consistent with the objectives of the Zoning Ordinance and
         the General Plan.
Most variances for housing projects are for relief from setback standards. The special
circumstances are usually substandard lot size or steep topography.
Design Review Permits often require variances. In these cases, the Town’s policy is to
process the applications jointly for a single fee in a combined public hearing. This saves time
and costs, and generally simplifies the process.
Land Division
The Corte Madera Municipal Code recognizes three types of land division:
    •    Lot line adjustment in which property lines between two or more parcels are moved
         and no new lots are created.
    •    Parcel maps that divide a property into four or fewer parcels.
    •    Subdivision of a property into more than four lots.
Lot line adjustments are ministerial, and are approved by the Planning Director without
public hearing. No further Town approvals are required to allow the property owner to
record a lot line adjustment.
The Planning Commission conducts public hearings to review applications for parcel maps.
Subdivision improvement standards apply to parcel maps. The Planning Commission may
grant exceptions from the subdivision standards when it approves parcel maps subject to
making findings that match the findings for variance approval. The exception process is
integral to parcel map hearings and does not involve a separate review process. The
Town of Corte Madera Housing Element                                                              88

                                              4.0 HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
applicants may record a final parcel map after the Town Engineer has reviewed the
documents for compliance with the Planning Commission’s action.
Subdivision is a three-step hearing process involving public hearings on the Tentative Map
by the Planning Commission and the Town Council, and a third hearing by the Town Council
on the Final Map. The Planning Commission’s determination on the Tentative Map is advisory
to the Town Council. The Town Council considers the Planning Commission’s
recommendation on the Tentative Map, but the Council’s hearing is de novo. The Town
Council acts on the Final Map without a recommendation by the Planning Commission. The
Council’s action on the final map is ministerial.
The requirement for duel hearings on Tentative Map applications before both the Planning
Commission and the Town Council is not a significant constraint on development. The need
to conduct a Town Council hearing adds three weeks to the process. However, given that
the public is unfamiliar with the subdivision process because subdivision occurs so
infrequently in Corte Madera, it is reasonable to expect that Planning Commission Tentative
map approvals would be appealed to the Town Council if the requirement for a Council
hearing were not already in place. An appeal hearing would add more time to the process
than the requirement for a Town Council de novo hearing given the need for ten day filing
window before the appeal hearing can be scheduled. Also, once an appeal has been filed,
the Planning Department must prepare a separate staff report on the matters under appeal,
in addition to the reporting that is required for the Tentative Map application. The need to
draft a staff report on the appeal would extend the Tentative Map processing time line.
Accordingly, by eliminating the need for an appeal process, the duel hearing requirement for
Tentative Map applications is not a constraint on housing development.
Rezoning
Property owners or the Town may initiate rezonings. The Planning Commission considers
rezoning proposals at public hearings. If the Commission concurs with the request, it must
make a finding that the revision is consistent with the General Plan and forward its
recommendation to the Town Council. The Council in turn considers the requested rezoning
at public hearings and may approve the proposal on a finding that the change would be
consistent with the General Plan. The Town’s rezoning process is the minimum required by
the California Government Code and does not involve any unusual constraints on
development.
The Town initiated and completed the rezonings on the Wornum Drive Extension property
(Site #1 in the Available Land Inventory, Table 47), Old Corte Madera Square, and the San
Clemente Family Housing site in 2003. More recently, the Town rezoned the WinCup site in
2011 to the Mixed Use Gateway Overlay (MUGD) district. These actions applied affordable
housing overly districts to the respective properties.

     Codes and Enforcement
Corte Madera adopts and enforces the California Building Standards Code and subsidiary
regulations, contained in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. While these
standards raise construction costs, they are necessary to protect the public health and safety
and are required pursuant to State law. Title 24 results in energy savings and lower
operating cost for property owners and residents. The Town has amended the Fire Code to
require sprinklers for all new residential structures and for any addition or substantial
remodel that exceeds 50% of the original structure. The Town believes that this amendment
is critical to life safety. Corte Madera has also adopted the Wildland-Urban Interface Code,
which reduces fire exposure to buildings that are in or near fire-prone open space areas.
The Town’s code enforcement program is complaint-driven. The Town’s planners and the
Building Official investigate alleged code violations and most complaints are resolved
voluntarily. The Town has a nuisance abatement ordinance that may be used if necessary.
The Town may charge additional fees when work has been done without permits and require
that the work be brought up to code standards.
The Town is cognizant of Health and Safety Code section 17980(b)(2) and administers code
enforcement accordingly.

    On- and Off-Site Improvements
The Town of Corte Madera is built out, and all infrastructure, including curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, streets, and utilities are in place. Residential development involves hooking up to
the existing utilities, which already exist in the right-of-way.
On-site grading and drainage improvements are frequently required for new and remodeled
housing, especially in Corte Madera’s older, hillside neighborhoods. Although the public
improvements are in place, extensive on-site drainage improvements are often necessary on
steep lots to channel flows to the Town’s system. On-site drainage improvements can also
involve grading and retaining wall work to mitigate erosion and sliding, both for the safety of
the property and its occupants and for the protection of adjacent public infrastructure. While
these improvements may add to the cost of housing on affected properties, they are
necessary for public safety.
    Housing for Persons with Disabilities
As noted in the Special Needs section of the Housing Needs Analysis, persons with
disabilities have a number of housing needs related to the accessibility of dwelling units;
access to transportation, employment, and commercial services; and alternative living
arrangements that include on-site or nearby supportive services. The Town ensures that new
housing developments comply with the California Building Standards Code and federal
requirements for accessibility.
Reasonable Accommodation
Federal and State law impose an affirmative duty on local government to make reasonable
accommodations in their zoning and other land use regulations to remove barriers to
disabled persons who are seeking housing. The Housing Element must contain policies and
programs to implement fair housing laws and to provide housing for all needs groups. In
particular, the Housing Element should identify and remove constraints to the development
of housing for persons with disabilities, including land use and zoning regulations, and
provide reasonable accommodation as one method of promoting equal access to housing.
The fair housing laws require that municipalities apply flexibility or waive standards when
necessary to eliminate barriers to persons with disabilities. For example, it may be necessary
to waive setback standards to allow installation of a ramp to facilitate access to a home.
The California Attorney General has opined that the usual variance or use permit procedure
does not provide the correct standard for making fair housing determinations. In the typical
process of granting relief from a zoning standard, the focus is on special characteristics of
the property. However, in the case of disabled access, the issue is the special need of the
individual that makes the zoning standard a barrier to accessing housing. In response to this
problem, many California municipalities are adopting fair housing reasonable accommodation
procedures to address barriers in land use and zoning regulations.
Procedures for Ensuring Reasonable Accommodations
In 2014, the Town amended the Zoning Ordinance to provide a procedure for people with
disabilities to request reasonable accommodation in the application of zoning laws and other
land use regulations, policies and procedures. Applications are reviewed and approved by
the Planning and Building Director if no discretionary permit approval is required other than

the request for reasonable accommodation. Otherwise, the request is reviewed by the
appropriate reviewing authority.
The Town of Corte Madera does not impose additional zoning, building code, or permitting
procedures on group homes other than those allowed by State law. There are no Town
initiated constraints on housing for persons with disabilities caused or controlled by the
Town of Corte Madera. The Town also allows residential retrofitting to increase the suitability
of homes for persons with disabilities in compliance with accessibility requirements. Such
construction is regulated under Chapter 11A, Housing Accessibility, of the California Building
Standards Code.
Zoning and Other Land Use Regulations
Corte Madera implements and enforces Chapter 11A, Housing Accessibility, of the California
Building Standards Code. The Town provides information to all interested parties regarding
accommodations in zoning, permit processes, and application of building codes for housing
for persons with disabilities.
The Town has not identified any zoning or other land-use controls that could discriminate
against persons with disabilities or restrict access to housing for disabled individuals.
Examples of the ways in which the Town of Corte Madera facilitates housing for persons with
disabilities through its regulatory and permitting processes include:
     •   The Town permits group homes in all residential districts with no regulatory
         restrictions, except compliance with the building code.
     •   The Town does not restrict occupancy of unrelated individuals in group homes and
         does not limit the number of persons living in a housing unit.
     •   The Town permits housing for special needs groups, including persons with
         disabilities, without regard to distances between uses. The Land Use Element of the
         General Plan does not restrict the sites of special needs housing.
Permitting Procedures
The Town does not impose special permit procedures or requirements that could impede the
retrofitting of homes for accessibility. The requirements for building permits and inspections
are the same as for other residential projects and not burdensome. Town officials are not
aware of any instances in which an applicant experienced delays or rejection of a retrofitting
proposal for accessibility to persons with disabilities.
As discussed above, the Town of Corte Madera allows group homes by right, as required by
State law. No use permit or other special permitting requirements apply to such homes. The
Town does not impose special occupancy permit requirements or business licenses for the
establishment or retrofitting of structures for residential use by persons with disabilities. If
structural improvements were required for an existing group home, a building permit would
be required. If a new structure were proposed for a group home use, design review would
be required as for any other new residential structure. The Town’s design review process
has not been used to deny or substantially modify a housing project for persons with
disabilities to the point where it is no longer feasible. All residential projects in the Town
require the same level of design review.

Land Costs
Two major factors contribute to high land costs in Corte Madera: high demand and short
supply. 5 Land costs in Marin vary both between and within jurisdictions based on factors
such as the desirability of the location and the permitted density. In Corte Madera, a 0.59
acre vacant lot at 530 Chapman Drive (Site #9 in Table 47) sold in December 2013 for
$350,000 6.
Generally, land zoned for multifamily and mixed-use developments is more expensive than
property zoned for single-family. Based on the assessed land value of the 180-unit Tam
Ridge Residences project ($15,063,560 for 4.54 acres), the estimated value of land zoned
for multi-family housing is $3,300,000 per acre, or approximately $84,000 per unit.
In Marin County, land costs average around 15-20 percent of construction costs for
multifamily developments. Even though land costs for single-family homes vary widely
throughout the county, the costs (as a percentage) are significantly higher than for
multifamily developments.
Multifamily Construction Costs
Construction costs include both hard costs, such as labor and materials, and soft costs,
including architectural and engineering services, development fees, and insurance. According
to local developers, hard construction costs (including site improvements) for a typical two
or three-story multi-family development average approximately $200 per square foot. Thus,
a 25-unit development with a gross building area of 21,000 square feet would have hard
construction costs of approximately $4.2 million, or about $168,000 per unit. Soft costs
typically add 45 to 50 percent to this base cost, yielding a per unit total construction cost of
approximately $252,000.
  Single Family Construction Costs
According to local contractors and realtors, construction costs in Marin County vary between
$200 and $250 per square foot for average construction and can go up to (and over) $500
per square foot for a high-end, custom-built single family house. Soft costs (including
architectural and engineering fees, property taxes during construction, city and utility fees,
and construction loan interest and fees) typically increase these costs by approximately 35 to
40 percent. Construction costs can be higher if lots require substantial site work due to
steep slopes, unstable soils, waterways, and other environmental concerns.
Financing
Over the past year, mortgage rates for conventional 30-year fixed rate loans have ranged
between 4.2 percent and 4.6 percent for a 30-year fixed rate loan (HSH.com). These
conforming loans, which are backed by the federal government through the Federal Housing
Administration and the Government Sponsored Entities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are
generally available to home buyers with good credit histories and adequate down payments.
5
  According to the Marin Economic Commission’s Marin Profile 1999: A Survey of Economic, Social and Environmental Indicators,
84 percent of land area in Marin is designated for agriculture, park lands and open space and watershed. Of the remaining land,
11 percent is developed and five percent is listed as potentially developable development.

Interest rates on non-conforming loans (also known as “jumbo” loans) for loan amounts
over $625,500 (in Marin County) are about one-quarter percentage point higher than
conforming loan rates, and are more difficult to secure. Tighter lending standards have
made it harder to get a home loan, especially for those with poor credit scores and virtually
impossible for a borrower with undocumented income.
Small changes in the interest rate for home purchases dramatically affect affordability. A 30-
year home loan for $400,000 at five percent interest has monthly payments of roughly
$2,150. A similar home loan at seven percent interest has payments of roughly 20 percent
more, or $2,660.
Construction loans for new housing are very difficult to secure in the current market. In past
years, lenders would provide up to 80 percent of the cost of new construction (loan to cost
ratio). In recent years, due to market conditions and government regulations, banks require
larger initial investments by the builder. Many builders are finding it difficult to get
construction loans for residential property at the current time, with the exception of limited
funding available through local banks, and must rely on private funds or seller carry-back
loans. Banks that are underwriting construction loans are requiring 25 to 35 percent cash
equity; interest rates range from 4 to 6 percent. Loans for land acquisition are extremely
difficult to secure, and lenders will typically provide financing for only 50 to 65 percent of the
land value, at an interest rate of approximately 7.5 percent, for projects that are permit-
ready.
Affordable housing developments face additional constraints in financing. Though public
funding is available, it is allocated on a highly competitive basis and developments must
meet multiple qualifying criteria, often including the requirement to pay prevailing wages.
Smaller developments with higher per unit costs are among the hardest to make financially
feasible. This is because the higher costs result in a sale price that is above the affordability
levels set for many programs. Additionally, smaller projects often require significant inputs of
time by developers, but because the overall budget is smaller and fees are based on a
percentage of total costs, the projects are often not feasible. These conclusions were
developed in research done for the 2009 Marin Housing Element Workbook.
Rental developments tend to be easier to finance than for-sale projects, as there are more
sources of funding available. However, recent cuts in public spending statewide have put
pressure on these sources. Tax credits used to be valuable source of revenue for low-income
housing developers, but programs have been cut and the tax credit resale market has
softened.
Affordable Housing Fund
In 2001 the Corte Madera Town Council adopted a nonresidential development impact fee
ordinance and established an Affordable Housing Fund. The impact fee is assessed on a
sliding scale based on the expected density of employees, ranging from $.40 per square foot
for warehouse space to $4.79 per square foot for office buildings. Nonresidential impact fee
proceeds are deposited in the Affordable Housing Fund. The Fund also receives affordable
housing in-lieu fees that are paid by market rate housing projects to comply with the
inclusionary housing ordinance. Expenditures from the Affordable Housing Fund including
any interest derived from the fund can only be for “the land or building costs associated with
developing housing affordable to low- and very low-income households” (CMC §3.48.030).
In 2005 the Town awarded $84,000 from the fund as a grant for the San Clemente Place
housing project. The Town collected approximately $155,000 in affordable housing impact

and (6) promote equal housing opportunities for all persons. The goals, policies, and
programs listed in this section outline the means the Town will use to achieve the
quantified objectives represented by the Regional Needs Housing Allocation analyzed in
section 3.3 and the quantified objectives discussed below.
    Quantified Objectives
California law requires that housing elements include quantified objectives for the
number of units likely to be constructed, rehabilitated and conserved/preserved by
income level for the planning period. The Town of Corte Madera quantified objectives
for the 2015-2023 Housing Element are shown in Table 65 below.

Corte Madera can meet its remaining Regional Housing Needs Allocation for new
construction by October 31, 2022, with the sites described in the available land
inventory and the programs described in this section. While the available land inventory
shows additional capacity, the new construction objectives are a conservative estimate
recognizing current economic trends. The rehabilitation objective assumes completion of

at Marin Apartment Homes) that was approved in 2010. As a condition of approval, the
Town required that these badly deteriorated units be brought up to code.
There are 79 privately managed affordable units in the community at San Clemente
Place. These were built in 2008, and are subject to restrictions to keep them affordable
for 55 years. Given this restriction that is set in part by the project funding as well as the
conditions of approval, these units are not part of the objectives for
conserving/preserving affordability. However, there are 31 below market ownership
units in the community that must be monitored to assure that they remain affordable on
resale. The Marin County Housing Authority, under contract to the Town, monitors these
units and is required to advise the Town when there is a risk that affordability could be
compromised.
5.2       GOALS, POLICIES & PROGRAMS
Corte Madera’s housing goals, policies, and programs have been revised in response to
the outreach process and the evaluation of the 2011 Housing Element as summarized in
Section 3 of this updated edition of the Housing Element and as described in detail in
Appendix A.
The goals, policies, and programs are organized as follows:
     •    Goals are broad statements reflecting community values and ideal future vision.
          Goals are numbered H-1, H-2, etc.
     •    Policies are specific statements that guide decision-making in order to promote
          the achievement of a goal. In some instances, a policy may be specific enough to
          provide clear direction as to how implementation will occur. Policies are listed
          with corresponding goals and are numbered H-1.1, H-1.2, etc.
     •    An implementation program is an action or procedure that carries out a policy.
          Most policies have one or more corresponding implementation programs.
          Implementation programs are in sequence with goals and policies, and are
          numbered H-1.1.a, H-1.1.b etc.
Goal H-1            Promote housing opportunity.
Assist in developing housing opportunities for all types and sizes of households and for
all economic segments of the community.
Policies and Implementation Programs:
Policy H-1.1.
Diversity of Population. Consistent with the community's housing goals, it is the
desire of the Town to maintain a diversity of age, social, and economic backgrounds
among residents throughout Corte Madera by matching housing size, types, tenure, and
affordability to household needs. Housing opportunities for families with children should
not be limited because necessary facilities are not provided on site.

                    component.
               b. Negotiate a Development Strategy. Develop and implement an
                    appropriate strategy for achieving affordable housing on the property.
                    Elements of a strategy include partnering with a developer and providing
                    land.
               c. Market Affordable Housing Units. The Town will oversee marketing the
                    units to assure that Housing Element goals are maximized.
               d. Income Categories. At a minimum, implement the affordable housing

          Monitor the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. Consider the following issues as
          part of the process to update the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance as necessary.
               a. Ongoing evaluation to determine if the Town needs to adjust the number
                    and/or percentage of affordable units required by income category to rates
                    that promote the achievement of the Town’s affordable housing goals
                    without unduly impacting overall housing production and supply.
               b. Adjust the in-lieu fee schedule to assure that the fee rate adequately
                    addresses the cost of providing an affordable unit or the required fraction
                    of an affordable unit.
               c. Evaluate the threshold for requiring inclusionary housing for small
                    residential developments (1-9 units).

Policy H-2.13
Options for Meeting Inclusionary Requirements. The primary intent of the
inclusionary requirement is the construction of new units on-site, with the focus being
multi-family housing developments with deed restrictions to support long periods of
affordability. Second priority for meeting inclusionary requirements shall be the
construction of units off-site or the transfer of land and sufficient cash to develop the
number of affordable units required within the same community or planning area. If
these options are not practical, other alternatives of equal value such as in-lieu fees or
rehabilitation of existing units may be considered.

Payment of In-Lieu Fees. Payment of in-lieu fees will only be accepted when it is
determined that transfer of land and/or dedication of units would prohibit any residential
development on the site or would provide fewer affordable housing units than could be
obtained by the expenditure of in-lieu fees on affordable housing development within
the planning area. Fees paid in-lieu of providing units on site shall be of a value to
adequately address the number of units required to be provided. The amount of the fee
shall be established by a schedule that is periodically reviewed and updated by the Town
Council.

                    districts on parcels in excess of 7,500 square feet.
               b. As a condition of approval of any parcel map or tentative map, resulting
                    in five or more parcels, 50% plus one of all parcels created by the land
                    division in excess of 7,500 square feet would be subject to the mandatory
                    second unit requirement. In the event that only one of the new parcels is
                    larger than 7,500 square feet, that lot would be subject to the
                    requirement.
               c. Any new unit on any parcel covered by this requirement would be
                    required to build a second unit. A new unit would include any
                    construction that would increase the size of an existing unit or tear-down
                    by 75% or more.
               d. Mandatory 2nd units would not be counted for purposes of calculating the
                    inclusionary requirement or development density.
               e. The 2nd unit and the main unit would not be counted as dwelling units
                    for the purposes of determining inclusionary housing requirements (i.e.,
                    the requirement to provide inclusionary units or pay an in-lieu fee).

Policy H-3.2
Housing Design Principals. The intent in the design of new housing is to provide
stable, safe, and attractive neighborhoods through high quality architecture, site
planning, and amenities that address the following principals:
    a. Reduce the Perception of Building Bulk. In multi-unit buildings, require designs
          that break up the perceived bulk and minimize the apparent height and size of
          new buildings, including the use of upper story step backs and landscaping.
          Create multi-family buildings that have the appearance of gracious single-family
          homes. Windows and doors, for example, are an important element of building
          design and an indicator of overall building quality.
    b. Recognize Existing Street Patterns. Incorporate transitions in height and setbacks
          from adjacent properties to ensure development character and privacy. Design
          new housing so that it relates to the existing street pattern and creates a sense
          of neighborliness with surrounding buildings.
    c. Enhance the "Sense of Place" by Incorporating Focal Areas. Design new housing
          around natural and/or designed focal points, emphasized through direct
          pedestrian/pathway connections. Respect existing landforms, paying attention to
          boundary areas and effects on adjacent properties.
    d. Minimize the Visual Impact of Parking and Garages. Discourage home designs in
          which garages dominate the public facade of the home (e.g. encourage
          driveways and garages to be located to the side of buildings and recessed, or
          along rear alleyways or below the building in some higher density
          developments).
    e. Use Quality Building Materials. Building materials should be high quality, long
          lasting, durable and energy efficient.
          Im plem entation Program H-3.2.a:          Housing Design Principals

                                     Monday, June 30, and Thursday, July 24, 2014
Overview
On Monday, June 30, and Thursday, July 24, the Town of Corte Madera held two public meetings to
provide information and receive input on the Town’s Housing Element Update. The July 30
workshop was held at the Corte Madera Recreation Center and had approximately 6o attendees. The
July 24 meeting was held at Corte Madera Town Hall and had approximately 20 attendees, some of
whom also attended the June 30 workshop. Both meetings were noticed to the public via the Town’s
e-notification system, the Town’s website, advertisements in the Marin Independent Journal and the
Twin Cities Times, and the Corte Madera Recreation Center reader board.
The meetings were identical in scope and content. Meetings began at 7 pm and concluded at 9 pm.
Adam Wolff, Corte Madera Planning Director, provided introductory remarks, and Christine
O’Rourke, contract housing element planner, presented a slide show that covered the following
material:
     Background on
          housing element
          requirements and the
          Regional Housing
          Need Assessment
          (RHNA) process.
     Historical and current
          RHNA, broken down
          by income categories
          for the 2015-2023
          planning period.
Town of Corte Madera Housing Element              Page A-1                         Appendix A

     Housing production over the 2007-2014 planning period.
     Demographic statistics, including population and employment trends, age group trends, and
          household types and characteristics.
     Current rents and sale prices for housing, and how these prices relate to the various
          household income categories (very low, low, moderate and above moderate).
     Existing affordable housing in Corte Madera, both rental and ownership.
     Strategies to meet the RHNA for the 2015-2023 planning period, including the retention of
          housing opportunity sites identified in the prior Housing Element, adopted in 2011.
Participants asked questions following the presentation and engaged in a group discussion. Staff
posed the following questions to the group:
     Are there any additional housing strategies the Town should pursue to meet its affordable
          housing needs and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) requirements?
     Are there other housing issues or concerns that should be addressed?
The agendas, presentations and minutes are available on the Town’s website at http://www.ci.corte-
madera.ca.us/planning/HousingElementUpdate2015-2023.html.
Summary of Comments and Input
While concerns were raised about state housing requirements and the accuracy of the RHNA
numbers (particularly in the prior cycle), development patterns, and traffic in general, there was a
general understanding that meeting the 2015-2023 RHNA requirements would not require
endorsing major new housing projects or significant new housing policy. As presented, housing
potentially developed through the continued production of second units, the proposed project at
1421 Casa Buena Ave., and the remaining sites identified in the 2007-2014 Housing Element Update
would sufficiently meet the Town’s RHNA requirements and would not require any rezoning
actions.
Discussion related to housing policy and
strategies focused on facilitating second
units and junior second units as a way to
address affordable housing needs and
evolving housing demand, while the
resulting traffic from any new housing
production remained a concern.
Participants also noted that the Housing
Element Update should address the
Town’s jobs/housing imbalance and
expanding senior population.

The following comments were provided both during the meeting and on submitted comment forms
and letters.
Housing Policy
     Since the Town can meet its RHNA with the existing housing opportunity sites, the Town
          has a chance to identify priorities people want to see in housing, senior housing and second
          units.
     Provide housing so that people who work in Corte Madera can also live in the community.
     Corte Madera has twice as many jobs as housing units. Housing element polices should
          promote development that addresses the jobs/housing imbalance and reduce commuting.
     Corte Madera’s aging population presents both challenges and opportunities for the
          community. Many are empty nesters, which means a good portion of the already built
          environment is underutilized and could possibly be converted to second units. The
          community should also consider adding another senior residential facility, although this
          would require a larger parcel with enough units to make the project economically feasible.
     The housing element should advance sustainability goals, e.g., encourage housing within
          walking distance of transit and major destinations, and promote home offices and live-work
          spaces.
     Limit future housing density to less than 20 units per acre and two stories. Require new
          development to include enough low income units to meet RHNA requirements. Require
          sufficient green space and landscaping to beautify the transition from the street.
     The Town should limit the size of units in multifamily developments in order to reduce FAR
          and require 20% of the units to be affordable.
     Do not build housing in environmentally sensitive areas.
     Return to having representation in ABAG and fight for zero regional requirements.
Second Units
     Allow amnesty for second units and relaxed zoning for second units.
     Consider traffic impacts if second units are allowed in certain neighborhoods.
     Adopt an ordinance to allow junior second units which would create a less expensive, more
          energy-efficient and less intrusive housing option for the community. Several participants
          supported the concept of junior second units, while others were concerned about traffic and
          parking impacts.
     Fees for second units are very high and keep property owners from adding second units to
          their homes. Consider reducing building permit and development fees.
     Consider Town subsidies for low-income second units.
     Rental income generated from second units can make it possible for homeowners to keep
          their homes.
     Rely on second units to meet RHNA requirements and take the Wornum Drive Extension
          parcel off the list of housing opportunity sites.

     Encourage property owners to divide their large homes into duplexes.
Housing Sites
     There are some underutilized commercial areas that could be designated for redevelopment
          and housing – in particular, the area at the corner of Paradise Drive and Madera Del Presidio
          where the Town must provide flood protection. These buildings are very old and could be
          renovated for mixed use with housing on the second floor, and the area could be elevated
          above the base flood elevation.
     An additional potential site may be the triangle formed by Paradise and San Clemente Drive,
          which currently has some residential.
     Traffic congestion around Madera Gardens, and particularly around the schools, is a major
          concern.
     Consider mixed-use housing at Corte Madera Square and Park Madera Center.
     Preserve the bicycle/pedestrian pathway on the Wornum Drive Extension site.
     The Wornum Drive Extension site is a sensitive ecological area.
     Development of the Wornum Drive Extension site will make traffic unbearable in the area.
Next Steps
In response to the input gathered from the community, staff will consider policies related to the
concept of junior second units. Existing programs and policies will be reviewed to determine if any
modifications are needed to support identified needs for senior housing, live/work opportunities,
and sustainability goals. Existing development standards and inclusionary requirements will also be
evaluated. A draft Housing Element Update is scheduled to be presented to the Planning
Commission and Town Council in October.

   Corte Madera, CA 94925
   Dear Mr. Kumar,
   Chapter 727, Statutes of 2005 (SB 1087) requires local governments to provide a copy of the
   adopted housing element to water and sewer providers. As you know, water and sewer
   providers must grant priority for service allocations to proposed developments that include
   housing units affordable to lower-income households. Enclosed please find a copy of Corte
   Madera’s most recent housing element, which the Town Council adopted on May 19, 2015.
   California law requires towns, cities, and counties to periodically update their housing elements
   to address their share of the regional housing need as determined by the council of
   governments for the area. The Association of Bay Area Governments has assigned Corte
   Madera a Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) of 72 units.
   The 2015-2023 Housing Element sets out a range of policies to meet these needs, focusing on
   in-fill development strategies. Please note the sites inventory and analysis in Chapter 3. The
   Town will be putting particular emphasis on promoting development of second units and “high
   potential” sites identified in the inventory. As opportunities present themselves at these
   properties, Town staff will be working with your agency to assure that these sites get the
   highest priority for water service.
   As always we appreciate your continuing cooperation and assistance. Please do not hesitate to
   call me at 927-5059 if I can answer and questions.
   Sincerely,
   Adam Wolff
   Director, Planning and Building

2.1         INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Chapter establishes the framework for the goals, policies and implementation
Programs that will guide the Town’s physical form and growth over the next 20 years. In
addition to addressing the intensity and distribution of land uses, this chapter addresses
other closely related topics, including Population, Demographics and Housing, and
provision of public services and facilities.
2.2         HISTORIC LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT IN CORTE
            MADERA
In 1834, John Reed was awarded a nine-square mile
Mexican land grant, which stretched from the tip of the
Tiburon peninsula to several miles northwest, and was
designated as Rancho de Corte Madera del Presidio.
Present-day Corte Madera lies within the boundaries of
John Reed’s Rancho. Soon after its occupation, gold
discoveries brought squatters to the area. The National
Homestead Act of 1862 led many of these people to
establish small dairy farms on the grassy hillsides in the
Rancho.
Completion of the North Pacific Coast railroad in 1875 was a turning point for the residents
of the area. The railroad tunnel under Corte Madera Ridge (just south of the terminus of
Tunnel Road) encouraged growth and development because it provided a fast and
convenient connection to San Francisco. Hillside roads, trails, and small tracts for summer
cottages were laid out and sold in the 1890s. In 1916 the citizens of Corte Madera voted in
favor of incorporation.
                                       Development continued, including filling in
                                       marshlands and reclaiming tidelands. Construction of
                                       the Redwood Highway (Highway 101) in 1929 and the
                                       opening of the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937 marked
                                       great changes in the area. Corte Madera’s most
                                       significant growth period saw population increasing
                                       from 1,098 in 1940 to 8,464 in 1970. By the 1970s,
                                       however, community sentiment began to change, and
                                       citizen and government efforts lead to acquisition and
                                       dedication of regional open space areas and
ecologically sensitive lands in and around the Town, including the Corte Madera State
Ecological Reserve.
Today, the Town of Corte Madera has a wide range of land uses and many distinct
neighborhoods. It includes low-density residential development on steep tree-covered hillsides,
as well as more urbanized residential lowland areas by San Francisco Bay. Commercial
development is a significant economic factor for the Town, with two large regional shopping

 centers (The Village and Town Center), as well as older neighborhood commercial centers.
 Offices, parks, schools and other uses are also found in the Town. The physical forms of the Town
 offer interesting contrasts, from extensive marsh and tidal lands along San Francisco Bay to
 hillsides that provide gateways to Mount Tamalpais and regional open spaces of Marin County.
 This diversity in the built and natural environments helps define the land use character of the
 Town.
 2.3          REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
 California Government Code §65302(a) requires that the General Plan include a Land Use
 Element, which addresses
          “the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the
          uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, including
          agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty,
          education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal
          facilities, and other categories of public and private uses of land. The land
          use element shall include a statement of the standards of population density
          and building intensity recommended for the various districts and other
          territory covered by the plan…”
 Through diagrams and text, this Chapter defines the distribution, density and planned
 intensity of development throughout the Town, including residential, commercial, mixed-
 use and public uses. It also includes a Land Use Diagram which provides a graphic
 representation of land use distribution.
 PLANNING BOUNDARIES AND TOWN SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
 The Town of Corte Madera encompasses approximately 2,500 acres or four square miles.
 California Government Code §65300 requires a municipality’s general plan to address “any land
 outside its boundaries which in the planning agency’s judgment bears relation to its planning. “
 Additionally, the Town has identified a Sphere of Influence, a boundary including lands around
 the Town limits which may ultimately be provided with Town services or which may be annexed.
 The Sphere of Influence for the Town includes all lands within the incorporated Town limits, as
 well as additional lands just beyond the Town limit line. In Corte Madera, there are only three
 areas in the Sphere of Influence beyond the Town limits:
 1) A large area within San Francisco Bay, east of the Town limits,
 2) Lands just beyond the southern Town limit near Tiburon and the Ring Mountain Open
      Space Preserve, and
 3) The area encompassed by the Greenbrae Boardwalk area at the north edge of the Town
      near Highway 101 and the northern edge of the Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve.
 The Town does not plan to annex any of these lands, which total approximately 400 acres,
 within the foreseeable future. The Town limits and Sphere of Influence are shown in
 Figure 2.1.

The effective Planning Area boundary for the General Plan is coterminous with the Town’s
Sphere of Influence. Policy documents from the surrounding cities and the County of Marin
which address areas beyond the Sphere of Influence were also considered in preparing the
Corte Madera General Plan. Of note is the boundary for Sanitary District No. 2, which
provides services to the Town. The boundary includes all lands within the Town limit, as
well as smaller portions of lands to the west, north and southeast of the Town.
ZONING ORDINANCE
The most recent Zoning Ordinance for Corte Madera was adopted by the Town Council in
1994 under Ordinance 785. The Zoning Ordinance is a primary tool for implementing the
policies of the General Plan, and addresses physical development standards and criteria for
the Town.
Government Code §65860 requires municipalities to maintain consistency between their
Zoning Ordinance and their adopted General Plan. The relationship between the Zoning
Districts established in the Zoning the General Plan Land Use designations are discussed in
Section 2.5 of this chapter.
CORTE MADERA DOCUMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS
Corte Madera Bayfront Vision Plan
In April 1994, a Steering Committee recommended a series of potential implementation
programs for the improvement of bayside Corte Madera. The implementation actions
included working with Caltrans on freeway exit signs, installation of Town identification
signs, installation of freeway landscaping, installation of pedestrian and bicycle paths,
preparation of a specific plan for the San Clemente/Paradise Drive commercial area and the
Paradise Drive Shopping Center, and Tamal Vista Boulevard improvements.
San Clemente/Paradise Drive Specific Plan
The San Clemente/Paradise Drive Specific Plan was adopted by the Town Council in 1979.
The Plan primarily addresses design issues for the “island” of land contained within the
boundaries of Paradise Drive and San Clemente Drive. A draft update to the Plan was
considered in 1999 to respond to 1989 General Plan policies and the Corte Madera Bayfront
Vision Plan. The update was never adopted, and is readdressed in policies in Section 2.7 of
this chapter.
Christmas Tree Hill Community Plan
The Christmas Tree Hill Community Plan was adopted by the Town in May 1992. It was
established in response to the 1989 General Plan that called for preparation and execution of

 Neighborhood Planning (Homeowners Associations)
 The Town has many homeowners associations, some of which consist of small, loose
 affiliations of homeowners in a particular neighborhood, while others are larger and more
 formal in their structure. Many of the active associations focus on maintenance of
 properties within their association boundaries, considering issues such as general
 neighborhood character, building additions, landscaping, storage of boats and vehicles, and
 similar issues. Other associations respond to issues as they arise within their particular
 neighborhood. Town representatives meet with the leaders of the homeowners associations
 on a regular basis to discuss issues of concern to the neighborhoods.
 LOCAL DOCUMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS
 Marin County General Plan
 The Town of Corte Madera is one of 11 incorporated cities and towns within Marin County.
 Marin County’s unincorporated lands adjoin Corte Madera on its western border.
 Marin County is in the process of updating its General Plan. Marin’s Draft Countywide
 Plan focuses largely on sustainability with updated elements addressing current issues.
 Issues emphasized include: traffic congestion (specifically, Highway 101 during rush hour)
 and the expansion of public transportation systems; affordable housing needs; energy
 conservation; and the preservation of Marin’s natural beauty.
 Neighboring Cities General Plans
 The Cities of Mill Valley and Larkspur and the Town of Tiburon are adjacent to Corte
 Madera. Due to their locations, each of these jurisdictions’ General Plans is relevant to the
 Corte Madera General Plan. In particular, shared land-use related issues between Larkspur
 and Corte Madera include shared public school acreage, police services, and open space.
 KEY LAND USE REGULATORY AGENCIES (LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL)
 Association of Bay Area Governments
 The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) was established in 1961 to protect local
 control, plan for the future, and promote cooperation on area wide issues. ABAG is the
 regional representative of the Bay Area, and its members consist of all cities and counties in
 the Bay Area. As such, state and federal governments have designated ABAG as the official
 comprehensive planning agency for the Bay Area. Its Regional Plan provides a policy guide
 for Bay Area municipalities.

 2.0 LAND USE
 While a balanced jobs:housing ratio is generally considered a positive factor for a
 community, the higher number of jobs in Corte Madera compared to residents results in
 increased local traffic congestion.
 The Town’s density and distribution of land uses in the future may contribute to air
 pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Recent research at the time of this General Plan
 has found that there is a connection between both density and local jobs with vehicle miles
 traveled (VMT). Residents tend to drive less and shorter distances if job opportunities and
 shopping opportunities are close to where they live. Studies show that the number of VMT
 and vehicle trips tends to decline as accessibility, density and mixed land use increase in an
 urban environment.
 According to the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), the population of Corte
 Madera is projected to grow to just over 10,000 by 2025 (an average increase of 0.4% per
 year). The Housing Element projects that the greatest increases in population levels over the
 next 40 years will be among elderly and young adult households. The Marin Commission
 on Aging (MCA) predicts that by the year 2020, one third of Marin County residents will be
 over the age of 60.
 The majority of households in Corte Madera (65%) are family households, and an additional
 25% are persons living alone. Marin County and Corte Madera have lower average
 household sizes than other portions of the Bay Area. Household size in Corte Madera is
 currently 2.43 persons, which is identical to that for all of Marin County. This size is
 projected to decrease to 2.37 persons by 2020, while average household size in Marin
 County is projected to decrease to 2.39 persons.
 INCOME
 The median household income in Corte Madera in 2000 was $79,839. The majority of
 households in Corte Madera are achieving moderate- and above moderate-income, and are
 headed by citizens between the ages of 35-54. The 2000 census estimated that 36% of
 existing Corte Madera households fell into the extremely low-, very low-, and low-income
 categories.
 EMPLOYMENT
 In the year 2000, 5,378 (58%) of Corte Madera’s residents were employed. This ratio has
 stayed fairly constant over time and is similar to the ratio for Marin County as a whole.
 Differences exist, however, in total jobs. Corte Madera provided jobs for 9,630 people in
 2000, almost twice the number of its employed residents and more than twice the number of
 its households. The majority of these jobs (approximately 42%) are in the retail sector (see
 Figure 2.3), and are filled by workers from outside of Corte Madera. The second largest,
 and fastest growing, sector is service, accounting for almost 28% of jobs. Agriculture and
 mining (0.3%) and manufacture and wholesale (8.1%) are minor sectors.

Marin County, in contrast, had fewer total jobs (123,000) than employed residents (141,000)
in 2000. The dominant sector is service, (45% of jobs), followed by retail, which provides
approximately 22% of County jobs. The agriculture/mining and manufacture/wholesale
sectors are minor job sources.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Corte Madera’s location is an advantage for its retail economy. Corte Madera has two
freeway exits and shares a third with Larkspur, is within 10 miles of the Golden Gate
Bridge, and has the first regional shopping centers north of San Francisco that have
adequate parking and are perceived as being safe, clean, and well maintained.

Corte Madera’s retail sector is the predominant influence on its economy, as well as the
major generator of sales tax revenues to the Town. Two regional shopping centers
dominate the retail environment: The Village at Corte Madera, and Corte Madera Town
Center.

 2.0 LAND USE
 Corte Madera’s retail economy is constrained by limited space for new or expanded
 development. Given that the Town is essentially built out, there is limited room for
 additional large-scale commercial development. Existing commercial and office centers
 could be redeveloped if landowner and market interests support such actions. Corte
 Madera has recently seen more opportunity for success in small, high-end retail shops, as
 well as office and service sector developments.
 Corte Madera’s vacancy rate in retail and office commercial tends to parallel but stay below
 the San Francisco North Bay Area average. For example, Corte Madera currently (Summer
 2004) has a 10% vacancy rate, while the North Bay Area has close to 17%. This reflects the
 Town’s favorable conditions within the region.
 HOUSING
 Housing Stock
 Corte Madera offers approximately 3,900 homes, 80% of which are single-family, detached
 houses. The majority of these were built between 1950 and 1970 (50.5%). More recently, an
 additional 189 units were constructed between 1990 and 2000, 81% of which were single-
 family and 19% of which were multi-family. Renovating the existing built environment,
 specifically existing residences, offers an opportunity for the Town to promote energy
 efficiency.       Chapter 3 (Resource Conservation and Sustainability) and Chapter 5
 (Community Design) of this Plan address energy conservation and green building
 principles in further detail.
 Housing Types and Costs
 The majority of housing units in Corte Madera are owner-occupied, single-family homes.

Work-Force Housing
The average cost of homes and rental units in Marin County is high compared to income
levels, and approximately 28,000 workers commute into Marin County daily.
Within Corte Madera, average wage rates do not allow the typical worker to purchase a
home in the Town. Many of the Town’s residents have higher wage rates tied to
employment centers elsewhere in the Bay Area; approximately 85 percent of the employed
residents in Corte Madera work outside the Town, and 48 percent work outside Marin
County. Most of the people who work within Town commute in and out of Corte Madera
daily to reach their jobs, causing high VMT and vehicle trips. Increasing the amount of
work force and affordable housing is one way to reduce the number of job-related VMT.
Encouraging higher density in the Town’s built environment where appropriate and
supporting housing that is affordable for the local workforce, are strategies to reduce criteria
pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions
Housing Needs
ABAG determines each City’s and County’s “regional fair share” of the projected future
housing needs for the Bay Area. These estimates are based on the overall regional housing
need number as established by the State of California. ABAG allocates “fair shares” to local
jurisdictions based on four factors:
     ♦ The vacancy rate in each town and its existing housing needs
     ♦ The projected growth in the number of households
     ♦ The local and regional income distribution
     ♦ The need for housing generated by local job growth.
Table 2.3 summarizes fair share housing needs as determined by ABAG.

 2.0 LAND USE
 In addition to accommodating overall housing needs, Corte Madera is responsible for
 planning housing for special needs groups. These groups include the local workforce,
 seniors, people living with disabilities, farm workers, homeless persons, people with
 HIV/AIDS or other illnesses, people in need of mental health care, single parent families,
 single persons with no children, and large households. Special needs housing is often
 enriched to provide services that promote independent living.
 Table 2.4 summarizes existing special needs housing, and is of particular relevance because
 of the anticipated increase in this population as society ages.

 HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS
 Land and development costs are higher in Corte Madera than in many other Bay Area
 municipalities. The amount of vacant land in the Town is limited. Most remaining lots are
 characterized by development-inhibiting properties such as steep slopes, irregular
 topography, Bay mud, or slide-prone areas. Costs for vacant land are estimated at
 approximately $1 million per acre (Corte Madera Housing Element, 2002).
 The Town’s adopted Housing Element includes policies to provide additional sites for
 multiple-family housing, and to allow increased densities to make affordable housing
 feasible. Policies are included to promote mixed-use sites that can effectively provide
 higher-density housing opportunities. Additionally, infrastructure, services and utilities are
 available to adequately serve in-fill development in the Town.
 Available Land and Ability to Meet “Fair Share” Housing Needs
 The Background Report for the Corte Madera General Plan Update identified vacant lands
 within the Town. Within these areas, several sites were identified in the 2002 Housing
 Element as potential sites for affordable housing units in Corte Madera. These sites are
 listed in Table 2.5.

 LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
 The Town of Corte Madera has identified 15 land use designations to describe typical land
 uses accommodated within the Town. The following designations are used to define the
 type, intensity, general distribution and general location of land uses proposed by the
 General Plan. While each designation identifies the intended range of land uses, the Zoning
 Ordinance will identify allowable, conditionally allowable and prohibited uses, as well as
 establishing development standards.

Residential Designations
Open Residential
Open Residential land use is intended for areas with special characteristics such as steep
slopes or potentially unstable soils or geologic conditions. This designation is also intended
for areas having special open space value due to their visual character or habitat resource
potential, including site proximity to regional open space areas. Single-family houses and
accessory residential uses with very low intensity characteristics (such as low parking
generation) are allowed, including second residential units. Minimum lot size is five acres,
but smaller existing parcels would not be precluded from developing one housing unit.
Minimum Lot Size: Five acres
Residential Development Density: From 0 to 0.2 dwelling units per gross acre
Approximate Population Density: Up to 2.5 persons per five acres, or up to 0.5 persons per acre
Applicable Zoning District: R-1-C (Open Residential District)
Hillside Residential
This residential designation applies to areas located in the Chapman Hill and Christmas
Tree Hill areas of Town. These areas are generally characterized by unique development
constraints, including steep slopes, ridgelines, limited accessibility, and limited
infrastructure capacity. Development within these areas is limited to single-family homes
and related accessory uses that have low intensity characteristics, including second
residential units.
Minimum Lot Size: 20,000 square feet
Residential Development Density: From 0.2 to 2.2 dwelling units per net acre
Approximate Population Density: From 0.5 to 5.5 persons per acre

 2.0 LAND USE
 Applicable Zoning Districts: C-2 (Regional Shopping District); AHMU (Affordable Housing Mixed
 Use District); PD (Planned Development Overlay District); BRNH (Baylands Risk Zone and
 Natural Habitat Overlay District)
 Mixed-Use – Gateway Area
 This designation applies to the 4.5 acre WinCup property at the northeast corner of the
 intersection of Tamal Vista Boulevard and Wornum Drive. This designation is intended to
 allow the continued use of the existing office, manufacturing, warehouse, and storage
 activities of the land, or a similar but less intense commercial/storage use. Should the
 property be redeveloped the mixed land use designation encourages higher-density
 residential development in conjunction with local-serving commercial uses, to promote
 efficient use of land resources, pedestrian and bicycle friendly environment, minimization of
 the visual impact of parked automobiles, and promote the use of transit over the private
 automobile.
 The Mixed-Use Gateway designation includes local-serving commercial uses (such as small
 retailers, restaurants, and cafes; spa, bicycle shop, convenience grocery stores; and
 residential support services such as dry cleaners, shoe repair, banks, and beauty saloons)
 and higher residential density uses combined in a single building or on a single site in an
 integrated development pattern.
 Minimum Lot Size: 20,000 square feet
 Non-Residential Floor Area Ratio: Up to 0.34
 Residential Development Density: From 25.1 to 40.0 dwelling units per gross acre.
 Approximate Population Density: 40 to 98 persons per gross acre.
 Applicable Zoning Districts: M (Light Industrial), MUGD (Mixed Use Gateway District); PD
 (Planned Development Overlay District).
 Mixed-Use: Old Corte Madera Square
 This designation is intended for areas fronting on or near Old Corte Madera Square, where
 local-serving commercial uses (such as retailers, small restaurants, grocery stores, drug
 stores, beauty salons, cleaners and banks) and residential uses may be combined in a single
 building or on a single site in an integrated development pattern. A “single site” may
 include contiguous properties. Development standards will allow for flexibility in
 application of development standards, and reduced and shared parking based on the use
 mix. This designation is intended to encourage residential development in conjunction with
 local-serving commercial uses or redevelopment, to promote efficient use of land resources,
 pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, minimization of the visual impacts of automobiles, and
 compatibility with the existing character of Old Corte Madera Square. Implementation of
 this approach shall be achieved through preparation of a Community Plan (Policy LU-1.4).
 Minimum Lot Size: 8,000 square feet
 Floor Area Ratio: Up to 1.0

Overlay Zone); H-P (Historic Preservation Overlay District); also, the Town will amend the Zoning
Code to include MRX (Mixed Use District)
Mixed-Use Commercial
This designation is intended to support infill activities, and site and building redevelopment
of existing neighborhood commercial centers and along commercial corridors. Allowable
uses include office, light industrial (non-manufacturing), and commercial services, as well
as new housing developments. The designation is intended to encourage a variety of
community activities and services to co-exist in close proximity to one-another (such as jobs,
housing and services), thereby reducing the need for extensive automobile travel. Reduced
parking standards may be allowed when the site is located within 0.25 mile of a transit stop.
Minimum Lot Size: 6,000 square feet

 COMMUNITY PLAN STUDY AREA MAPS
 Public Resources Code §21083.3 authorizes cities to adopt Community Plans to implement
 the General Plan in designated areas. A Community Plan is intended to provide more finite
 specification of the types of uses to be permitted, development standards (setbacks, heights,
 landscape, architecture, etc.), and circulation and infrastructure improvements.            A
 Community Plan is adopted by resolution as a document of policies and standards.
 The Corte Madera General Plan identifies four areas for which Community Plans shall be
 prepared:
      ♦ Old Corte Madera Square Area
      ♦ San Clemente Drive/Paradise Drive/Koch Road Area
      ♦ Fifer/Tamal Vista Area
      ♦ Tamalpais Drive/Casa Buena Drive area
 Figures 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 depict the study area boundaries within which Community
 Plans are recommended.
 Detailed descriptions of the proposed Community Plans are included in the Goals, Policies
 and Implementation Programs described in Section 2.7.

2.7         GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS FOR
            LAND USE
GOAL LU-1
A mix and distribution of land uses that enhances community character and serves the
needs of existing and future Town residents.
Land Use Policies and Implementation Programs:
POLICY LU-1.1
Maintain and implement the General Plan Land Use Diagram that describes the distribution
and location of land uses prescribed by General Plan policies (see Figure 2.4). Land use
designations are generalized groupings of land uses and titles that define a predominant
land use type. Land use designations are defined in Section 2.5 of the General Plan. Only
allow development that is consistent with the Land Use Diagram and the land use
designations. All proposed projects must meet density, floor area ratio, and other standards
governing the applicable land use designation.
        Implementation Program LU-1.1.a             Ordinance Revisions
        Prepare and adopt revisions to the Municipal Code, including the Zoning and
        Subdivision Ordinances, that organize and update existing resolutions and
        ordinances of the Town to ensure consistency with the General Plan, including land
        uses, lot sizes and floor area ratios. Uses and structures made non-conforming by
        adoption of the General Plan will be allowed to be continued, and further addressed
        in the Zoning Ordinance update.
                Responsibility:            Planning and Building Department
                Timeframe:                 Within two years of General Plan adoption

        Implementation Program LU-1.1.b             Mixed-Use Zone
        Amend the Corte Madera Zoning Ordinance to add a Mixed-Use Zone to implement
        the Mixed-Use designations, and apply this Zoning to lands so designated on the
        Land Use Diagram. Corollary changes to parking provisions of the Zoning
        Ordinance shall also be made to ensure adequate set-aside of parking spaces for
        residential uses in mixed-use developments.
                Responsibility:            Planning and Building Department

Community Plan Policies and Implementation Programs:
POLICY LU-1.4:
Identify opportunities to achieve desired land uses and physical improvements in and
around Old Corte Madera Square.
    Policy Intent: The area surrounding Old Corte Madera Square, depicted in Figure 2.5,
    effectively serves as one of the "centers" of the Town. It achieves this in part through the
    many historic buildings that adjoin the Square (a reminder of the Town’s development
    origins), in the varied retail and service establishments surrounding the Square, and by
    the primary focal and gathering point in the center of the Square, Menke Park.
    Community events are held at the Park, including the Town’s annual Oktoberfest
    celebration.
    The Town is committed to enhancing the area to promote pedestrian and bicycle activity
    and local businesses, and to improve circulation along the area roads. Circulation
    around Old Corte Madera Square is the focus of several policies included in Chapter 4
    (Circulation). Physically, future development would occur as infill, consistent in scale
    and character with the existing buildings. Expansion of existing uses to include
    residential units would enhance the area's activity and provide additional housing
    opportunities.     Future uses within the area should be considered in parallel with
    enhancement of opportunities for existing uses.
        Implementation Program LU-1.4.a:            Prepare Community Plan
        Prepare a Community Plan for the Old Corte Madera Square area to achieve the
        following objectives:
        Development Objectives:
               Recognize the significance of historic architecture around the Square when
                considering new development.
               Create opportunities for mixed retail, service, professional and residential
                land uses around the Square, including potential for development of
                affordable housing.
               Maintain a relatively low intensity of land use, similar in nature to current
                use in and around the Square, in order to preserve the established character
                in the area. Floor Area Ratios (FAR) shall not exceed a maximum FAR of 1.0,
                subject to Town review of development plans.
               Enhance the passive recreational value of Menke Park as a quiet, scenic
                resource.
               Create an environment to enhance business success around the Square.

 2.0 LAND USE
                 Identify uses that will enhance the Square’s attraction to Town residents.
                 Develop a locational signage program and provide gateway elements.
                 Utilize Design Guidelines for the Square area to maintain the diverse
                  architectural styles found in the area and enhance the appearance of new
                  development and rehabilitation of existing structures.
                 Future development within the Community Plan boundaries shall minimize
                  view impacts to properties with views of Mount Tamalpais and San Francisco
                  Bay through thoughtful building design and placement.
                 Undergrounding of utility lines.
         Traffic, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Objectives:
                 Improve traffic safety and flow around the Square.
                 Improve pedestrian and bicycle safety in and around the Square.
                 Improve the collective traffic, bicycle and pedestrian environment at the
                  intersection of Redwood and Corte Madera Avenues. This shall include
                  installation of accessible facilities for the disabled.
                 Calm traffic around the Square, through methods such as placement of parking
                  spaces, adding raised crosswalks, pedestrian islands, bulb-outs, pedestrian
                  controlled traffic signals, or pedestrian resting places.
                 Provide more convenient pedestrian access between Tamalpais Drive and First
                  Street. This may also include evaluation of a one-way, east-bound street
                  connection between First Street and Tamalpais Drive if pedestrian access and
                  safety can be improved.
                 Develop and implement a streetscape design program to enhance the pedestrian
                  environment and create an engaging gathering place.

POLICY LU-1.5:
Identify opportunities to achieve desired land uses and physical improvements in the San
Clemente Drive/Paradise Drive area.
    Policy Intent: The San Clemente Drive/Paradise Drive area, depicted in Figure 2.6,
    effectively functions as the southern "gateway" point to Bayside Corte Madera from
    Highway 101. The area currently serves various commercial, office and light industrial
    uses. The areas along San Clemente and Paradise Drives are included in the 1979 Town-
    adopted Specific Plan that focuses primarily upon design issues. This area was
    subsequently considered in the 1999 Draft San Clemente/Paradise Drive Specific Plan to
    respond to 1989 General Plan policies and the Corte Madera Bayfront Vision Plan. The
    Draft Specific Plan was not adopted.
    The Town is committed to encouraging mixed-use development in the area to more
    effectively showcase and link the area to adjacent commercial districts and residential
    neighborhoods. This includes recognition of the Town’s commitment to providing
    opportunities for development of affordable housing. Additionally, the Town wishes to
    enhance San Clemente Drive with “boulevard” streetscaping. Physically, future
    development would largely occur as infill (renovations of currently-developed sites), as
    well as improvements such as pedestrian-oriented plazas, walkways, and circulation
    spaces.
        Implementation Program LU-1.5.a:           Prepare Community Plan
        Prepare a Community Plan that encompasses lands in and around the San Clemente
        Drive/Paradise Drive area and which achieves the following objectives:
        Development Objectives:
               Develop the San Clemente/Paradise Drive Commercial Area as the gateway
                to Bayside Corte Madera.
               Allow for the intensity of land use to be relatively intense compared to
                current uses. Higher floor-area ratios (FARs) may be allowed, compared to
                existing development within the Community Plan area, and could include
                substantial redevelopment of existing sites. Higher FARs would be allowed
                when there is a demonstrated and extraordinary benefit provided to the
                Town in terms of job creation, exceptional design character, and other criteria
                established in the Community Plan related to redevelopment of existing sites,
                and where traffic and other environmental impacts can be mitigated to
                acceptable levels.
               Integrate existing land uses with infill development where feasible.

 2.0 LAND USE
                 Provide opportunity for development of housing as a means of reducing local-
                  area vehicle trips.
                 Provide locations for office and employment activities that are compatible with
                  the district and surrounding residential neighborhoods, and consistent with
                  underlying General Plan objectives for mixed uses.
                 Provide sufficient commercial services for adjacent residential neighborhoods.
                 Strengthen and upgrade the scenic quality of this area via improved maintenance
                  and intensity of landscaping along the freeway edges, especially at the south and
                  north entrances to the project area.
                 Limit the size and height of freeway-oriented signage. Adopt design guidelines
                  to improve the quality of signage in the Community Plan Area and reduce the
                  collective visual clutter of freeway-oriented signs.
                 Provide a clear implementation/phasing plan that creates a coherent image for
                  the area upon the phased completion of Community Plan area improvements.
         Traffic, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Objectives:
                 Widen and redevelop San Clemente Drive as a tree-lined boulevard, with
                  planted median, turning lanes, streetscaping, pedestrian and bicycle paths, while
                  also preserving the functionality of the street as an arterial.
                 Develop a central, pedestrian-oriented network of circulation linkages as the
                  focus of the mixed-use district.
                 Develop clear circulation linkages within the project boundaries, and access
                  points to Highway 101 and adjacent streets and boulevards. This may include
                  bicycle and pedestrian access across Highway 101 in the vicinity of the
                  Tamalpais Drive interchange.
                 Improve circulation within the area by installing medians and limiting the
                  number of driveway encroachments onto San Clemente Drive.
                 Develop bicycle linkages to the adjacent residential neighborhoods and to the
                  bicycle lane across San Clemente Drive.
                 Provide a high-quality pedestrian environment with wide sidewalks, safe street
                  crossings, street trees, pedestrian plazas, ample site landscaping and pedestrian
                  lighting. This shall include installation of accessible facilities for the disabled.
                 Provide pedestrian and bike connections to the adjacent residential
                  neighborhoods and mixed-use districts through enhancement of the Bayside
                  Trail Park and open space system.

POLICY LU-1.6:
Identify opportunities to achieve desired land uses and physical improvements in the Fifer
Avenue/Tamal Vista Boulevard area.
    Policy Intent: The Fifer Avenue/Tamal Vista Boulevard area, depicted in Figure 2.7,
    currently hosts a range of public facility, commercial service, and multi-family
    residential uses.
    The Town is committed to enhance the scenic character of the area via improved
    maintenance and intensity of landscaping, as well as to link the existing uses to adjacent
    mixed-use districts and residential neighborhoods. Additionally, the Town has
    identified opportunities for high-density, multi-unit residential uses in the area. Future
    infill development within the area should be considered in parallel with enhancement of
    opportunities for existing uses.
    The area may be impacted through changes to Highway 101 access. Planning and
    engineering studies conducted for the Highway 101/Sir Francis Drake Boulevard
    interchange may result in other interchange upgrades and modifications. Presently, the
    Town of Corte Madera, City of Larkspur and Marin County have agreed to a
    preliminary design that would create a full diamond interchange at Wornum Drive, and
    which would remove ramps to Fifer Avenue from the Highway. If such changes occur,
    they would have significant implications to vehicle access and land use opportunities in
    the Fifer Avenue/Tamal Vista Boulevard area, and should therefore be carefully
    considered in any final land use approach considered by the Town.

 2.0 LAND USE
         Development Objectives:
                 Encourage infill development that is consistent with underlying General Plan
                  objectives for mixed uses.
                 Allow for the intensity of land use to be relatively intense compared to current
                  uses. Higher floor-area ratios (FARs) are anticipated compared to existing
                  development within the Community Plan area, and could include substantial
                  redevelopment of existing sites. Higher FARs would be allowed when there is a
                  demonstrated and extraordinary benefit provided to the Town in terms of job
                  creation, exceptional design character, and other criteria established in the
                  Community Plan, and where traffic and other environmental impacts can be
                  mitigated to acceptable levels.
                 Provide locations for office and employment activities that are compatible with
                  the area and surrounding residential neighborhoods. Consider provisions for
                  multi-family residential use.
                 Upgrade the scenic quality of the area via improved maintenance and intensity
                  of landscaping.
                 Limit the size and height of freeway-oriented signage. Adopt design guidelines
                  to improve the quality of signage in the Community Plan Area and reduce the
                  collective visual clutter of freeway-oriented signs.
                 Provide a clear implementation/phasing plan that creates a coherent image for
                  the area upon the phased completion of Community Plan area improvements.
         Traffic, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Objectives:
                 Develop clear circulation linkages and access points to adjacent streets and
                  boulevards, and between developments.
                 Develop a central, pedestrian-oriented network of circulation linkages as the
                  focus of the district.
                 Develop clear circulation and bicycle linkages to the adjacent residential
                  neighborhoods.
                 Provide a high quality pedestrian environment with wide sidewalks, safe street
                  crossings, street trees, pedestrian plazas, ample site landscaping and pedestrian
                  lighting. This shall include installation of accessible facilities for the disabled.

POLICY LU-1.7:
Identify opportunities to achieve desired land uses and physical improvements in the
Tamalpais Drive/Casa Buena Drive area
    Policy Intent: The Tamalpais Drive/Casa Buena Drive area, depicted in Figure 2.8, is an
    important gateway to the community. The Town Center shopping center is aesthetically
    attractive and commercially strong, and there is a slow revitalization trend among other
    commercial properties in the area. However, a number of retail and service buildings in
    the area are near the end of their economic life and are marginally blighted. Also the
    area is part of the US 101 Corridor Study of ramps and interchanges from Tamalpais
    Drive through Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. The Tamalpais Drive/Highway 101
    intersection and overpass may be rebuilt as a part of the Corridor study during the life
    of this General Plan. A Community Plan that includes a program of public
    improvements and zoning incentives will accelerate the revitalization of this area.
        Implementation Program LU-1.7.a:            Prepare Community Plan
        Prepare a Community Plan that encompasses lands in and around the Tamalpais
        Drive/Casa Buena Drive area and which achieves the following objectives:

Infill Development Policies and Implementation Programs:
GOAL LU-3
Infill development that achieves a more livable, sustainable community.
Policy Intent: The Town of Corte Madera is largely built-out with only a few vacant,
developable parcels remaining. In the future, all development will be “infill” on vacant land
that is surrounded by development, or privately funded redevelopment of previously
developed properties. Redevelopment infill will range from simple remodeling projects to
proposals that call for the complete demolition of existing properties and construction of
new buildings. The following policies and implementation programs are intended to ensure
that infill projects meet the community’s needs and complement the existing fabric of the
Town.
POLICY LU-3.1
Provide for infill development in core Town areas.
        Implementation Program LU-3.1.a:            Infill Locations
        The General Plan Land Use Element includes policies calling for preparation of
        Community Plans for several key areas, and encourages redevelopment of other
        lands in and around commercial and office core areas of the Town. In doing so, the
        General Plan purposefully creates greater potential for more intensive infill
        development of sites that may be underutilized. Infill development can help create
        areas that are more compact with a diverse mixture of land uses, improve
        connectivity between neighborhoods and uses, reduce traffic congestion and provide
        a greater range of community amenities. In keeping with stated goals, infill
        development in core areas should also provide for transit oriented development.
        Infill development may occur within the Town’s four Community Plan areas, and in
        the Mixed Use Commercial, Commercial Services, Region-Serving Commercial and
        Office land use designations. Additionally, redevelopment of older apartment
        complexes, in areas generally designated for Medium Density or High Density
        Residential, are acceptable infill developments if retaining or increasing the number
        of rental units, consistent with density criteria of the General Plan and state density
        bonus regulations.

         Support infill development if findings can be made that the proposal is consistent
         with the infill goals and policies outlined herein, would be consistent with applicable
         provisions of the General Plan and would ensure land use compatibility with
         established neighborhood character. Approvals for infill development projects shall
         be based on findings of fact that the proposed projects have the potential to achieve
         one or more of the following attributes:
                Produce jobs for Town residents
                Create high density, market-rate and/or affordable housing
                Provide convenient access to transportation facilities and public transit, as well
                 as schools, shopping and other local destinations, as a means of increasing
                 residential density and commercial intensity
                Reduce automobile-oriented design
                Reduce creation of traffic congestion
                Utilize existing infrastructure systems
                Provide a desirable built environment, as described in LU-3.5, below
                Include community amenities, such as plazas, public art, street furniture, child
                 care centers, appropriate street landscaping and tree planning, and similar uses
                 or improvements
                Encourage community interaction through use of outdoor gathering and seating
                 areas and inclusion of pedestrian-oriented improvements

Larkspur School District
Neil Cummins Elementary School recently completed an $8.5 million modernization, which
is expected to ensure a facility that should be useable for the next twenty to thirty years.
Additionally, San Clemente School is located within the Town of Corte Madera and is
owned by the Larkspur School District. The building is currently leased to a private school.
Should future additional school facility space be necessary, the San Clemente School space
would allow the District to grow by 400 students, although significant building renovation
would be necessary.
Reed Union School District
The Facilities Master Plan for the Reed Union School District sets forth approximately $68
million of needed improvements to their schools. The work will be completed in phases,
and includes modernization, repairs, remodeling, replacement of heating and other systems,
and ensuring buildings are up to current fire, earthquake and Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) codes. The District’s Granada School campus is located within the Town limits,
with building space leased primarily to private day care schools.
Tamalpais Union School District Facilities
Redwood High School has experienced some growth in recent years, and may be at or near
capacity by 2005.
Private Schools
There are a number of private academic schools in Corte Madera serving preschool through
twelfth grade students. Lycee Francais La Persouse is an International French School,
leasing the San Clemente School, catering to students in preschool through the twelfth
grade. It has a French National Curriculum with a strong English program. Enrollment is
approximately 200 students.
Marin Montessori School is located at 5200 Paradise Drive in Corte Madera. The Allaire
School, located at 50 El Camino Drive in Corte Madera, is a Special Education Academic
school. The Marin Country Day School at 5221 Paradise Drive in Corte Madera offers
education services for pre-kindergarten through the eighth grade students. Two private
schools in Larkspur and Tiburon also serve Corte Madera school-aged children. There are
also several preschools in Corte Madera that provide education for pre-kindergarten
children.
Library Services
The Corte Madera Regional Library is located on Meadowsweet Drive and is a branch of the
Marin County Free Library system. The branch was opened in 1928. The Library’s current
building was built in 1971 and is nearly 10,000 square feet. Support organizations include
the Friends of the Marin County Library and the Friends of the Corte Madera Library.

 WATER SUPPLY AND TREATMENT
 Water Supply
 The Town of Corte Madera obtains its water supply from the Marin Municipal Water
 District, which serves central and southern Marin County. The District operates seven
 reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 79,566 acre-feet (25, 927 million gallons). Five of
 the District’s reservoirs are on Mt. Tamalpais and two are in western Marin County. The
 District is able to provide 75 percent of water usage from rainfall stored in the reservoirs on
 Mt. Tamalpais and west Marin County. In addition, the Water District obtains 6,800 acre-
 feet annually from the Russian River, as well as 10,000 acre-feet from average annual stream
 releases. Average annual use for the Marin Municipal Water District is 28,622 acre-feet, or
 8,784 million gallons.
 Marin County planning projections indicate that the Marin water sources, along with
 Russian River water rights, will provide a sufficient supply for at least the first few decades
 of the 21st century.
 Water Treatment
 Treatment of surface water from the Mt. Tamalpais watershed begins in the reservoirs,
 where the water is seasonally aerated to maintain a proper oxygen balance. The water then
 goes to the Bon Tempe Treatment Plant on Mt. Tamalpais or the San Geronimo Treatment
 Plant in Woodacre. Fluoride has been added to the treated water since 1972.
 Water imported from the Russian River is naturally filtered in the deep sand and gravel
 below the riverbed and requires no further clarification. This water enters the District’s
 system at the Ignacio treatment facility, where water quality is monitored, and treatment is
 similar to the reservoir plants.
 Water Distribution
 The three potable water treatment plants have a total capacity of 82 million gallons. The
 pipeline system pumping units can deliver up to 38,000 gallons per minute. Because of
 Marin County’s hilly terrain, about 90 percent of the water must be pumped at least once
 before it reaches the tap. The District uses 146 storage tanks and 890 miles of pipeline.
 The majority of residences in Corte Madera receive water service from the Ross Valley
 gravity system. The system is fed by water from the San Geronimo treatment Plant via the
 Fairfax Transmission Line and from the Ross Reservoir. Several transmission lines wind
 their way through Ross Valley to Greenbrae and Corte Madera. This system is used to serve
 all properties up to an elevation of about 200 feet. The system also provides capacity for
 pumps to take water and boost it to elevations of about 500 feet to systems serving higher
 elevations.

WASTEWATER CONVEYANCE AND TREATMENT
Wastewater Conveyance
Sanitary District No. 2 of Marin County, a member of the Central Marin Sanitation Agency
(CMSA), provides wastewater services in Corte Madera. The CMSA, formed in 1979, is a
public joint powers agency of Ross Valley Sanitary District, San Rafael Sanitation District,
Sanitary District No. 2, and the City of Larkspur.
Within Corte Madera, sewage is conveyed mostly through a series of 6-, 8- and 10-inch clay
pipes in City streets and related easements to larger collection systems, connected to a series
of pump stations located throughout the Town. In 2006 the Paradise Pump Station was
completely rebuilt with state of the art mechanical and electrical components. This
increased the capacity and added redundancy to the pumping system.
Wastewater Treatment
The CMSA Subregional Wastewater Treatment Plant, located in San Rafael, treats sewage
from member Districts conveyed from several remote pump stations. The Treatment Plant
is capable of processing 125 million gallons of sewage per day during peak rainfall periods,
but has average flows of less than 10 million gallons per day.
CMSA and the Marin Municipal Water District are considering a reclamation plant where
reclaimed wastewater will be used for non-potable uses such as irrigation of pastureland,
parks, schools, and industrial complexes.

2.1         INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Chapter establishes the framework for the goals, policies and implementation
Programs that will guide the Town’s physical form and growth over the next 20 years. In
addition to addressing the intensity and distribution of land uses, this chapter addresses
other closely related topics, including Population, Demographics and Housing, and
provision of public services and facilities.
2.2         HISTORIC LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT IN CORTE
            MADERA
In 1834, John Reed was awarded a nine-square mile
Mexican land grant, which stretched from the tip of the
Tiburon peninsula to several miles northwest, and was
designated as Rancho de Corte Madera del Presidio.
Present-day Corte Madera lies within the boundaries of
John Reed’s Rancho. Soon after its occupation, gold
discoveries brought squatters to the area. The National
Homestead Act of 1862 led many of these people to
establish small dairy farms on the grassy hillsides in the
Rancho.
Completion of the North Pacific Coast railroad in 1875 was a turning point for the residents
of the area. The railroad tunnel under Corte Madera Ridge (just south of the terminus of
Tunnel Road) encouraged growth and development because it provided a fast and
convenient connection to San Francisco. Hillside roads, trails, and small tracts for summer
cottages were laid out and sold in the 1890s. In 1916 the citizens of Corte Madera voted in
favor of incorporation.
                                       Development continued, including filling in
                                       marshlands and reclaiming tidelands. Construction of
                                       the Redwood Highway (Highway 101) in 1929 and the
                                       opening of the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937 marked
                                       great changes in the area. Corte Madera’s most
                                       significant growth period saw population increasing
                                       from 1,098 in 1940 to 8,464 in 1970. By the 1970s,
                                       however, community sentiment began to change, and
                                       citizen and government efforts lead to acquisition and
                                       dedication of regional open space areas and
ecologically sensitive lands in and around the Town, including the Corte Madera State
Ecological Reserve.
Today, the Town of Corte Madera has a wide range of land uses and many distinct
neighborhoods. It includes low-density residential development on steep tree-covered hillsides,
as well as more urbanized residential lowland areas by San Francisco Bay. Commercial
development is a significant economic factor for the Town, with two large regional shopping

 centers (The Village and Town Center), as well as older neighborhood commercial centers.
 Offices, parks, schools and other uses are also found in the Town. The physical forms of the Town
 offer interesting contrasts, from extensive marsh and tidal lands along San Francisco Bay to
 hillsides that provide gateways to Mount Tamalpais and regional open spaces of Marin County.
 This diversity in the built and natural environments helps define the land use character of the
 Town.
 2.3          REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
 California Government Code §65302(a) requires that the General Plan include a Land Use
 Element, which addresses
          “the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the
          uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, including
          agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty,
          education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal
          facilities, and other categories of public and private uses of land. The land
          use element shall include a statement of the standards of population density
          and building intensity recommended for the various districts and other
          territory covered by the plan…”
 Through diagrams and text, this Chapter defines the distribution, density and planned
 intensity of development throughout the Town, including residential, commercial, mixed-
 use and public uses. It also includes a Land Use Diagram which provides a graphic
 representation of land use distribution.
 PLANNING BOUNDARIES AND TOWN SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
 The Town of Corte Madera encompasses approximately 2,500 acres or four square miles.
 California Government Code §65300 requires a municipality’s general plan to address “any land
 outside its boundaries which in the planning agency’s judgment bears relation to its planning. “
 Additionally, the Town has identified a Sphere of Influence, a boundary including lands around
 the Town limits which may ultimately be provided with Town services or which may be annexed.
 The Sphere of Influence for the Town includes all lands within the incorporated Town limits, as
 well as additional lands just beyond the Town limit line. In Corte Madera, there are only three
 areas in the Sphere of Influence beyond the Town limits:
 1) A large area within San Francisco Bay, east of the Town limits,
 2) Lands just beyond the southern Town limit near Tiburon and the Ring Mountain Open
      Space Preserve, and
 3) The area encompassed by the Greenbrae Boardwalk area at the north edge of the Town
      near Highway 101 and the northern edge of the Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve.
 The Town does not plan to annex any of these lands, which total approximately 400 acres,
 within the foreseeable future. The Town limits and Sphere of Influence are shown in
 Figure 2.1.

Sphere of Influence. Policy documents from the surrounding cities and the County of Marin
which address areas beyond the Sphere of Influence were also considered in preparing the
Corte Madera General Plan. Of note is the boundary for Sanitary District No. 2, which
provides services to the Town. The boundary includes all lands within the Town limit, as
well as smaller portions of lands to the west, north and southeast of the Town.
ZONING ORDINANCE
The most recent Zoning Ordinance for Corte Madera was adopted by the Town Council in
1994 under Ordinance 785. The Zoning Ordinance is a primary tool for implementing the
policies of the General Plan, and addresses physical development standards and criteria for
the Town.
Government Code §65860 requires municipalities to maintain consistency between their
Zoning Ordinance and their adopted General Plan. The relationship between the Zoning
Districts established in the Zoning the General Plan Land Use designations are discussed in
Section 2.5 of this chapter.
CORTE MADERA DOCUMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS
Corte Madera Bayfront Vision Plan
In April 1994, a Steering Committee recommended a series of potential implementation
programs for the improvement of bayside Corte Madera. The implementation actions
included working with Caltrans on freeway exit signs, installation of Town identification
signs, installation of freeway landscaping, installation of pedestrian and bicycle paths,
preparation of a specific plan for the San Clemente/Paradise Drive commercial area and the
Paradise Drive Shopping Center, and Tamal Vista Boulevard improvements.
San Clemente/Paradise Drive Specific Plan
The San Clemente/Paradise Drive Specific Plan was adopted by the Town Council in 1979.
The Plan primarily addresses design issues for the “island” of land contained within the
boundaries of Paradise Drive and San Clemente Drive. A draft update to the Plan was
considered in 1999 to respond to 1989 General Plan policies and the Corte Madera Bayfront
Vision Plan. The update was never adopted, and is readdressed in policies in Section 2.7 of
this chapter.
Christmas Tree Hill Community Plan
The Christmas Tree Hill Community Plan was adopted by the Town in May 1992. It was
established in response to the 1989 General Plan that called for preparation and execution of
a work program to address planning and safety issues in the Christmas Tree Hill area. The
Community Plan provides policy direction to the Town to respond to issues of residential

 setbacks, on-street parking, second residential units, and trail easements.
 Neighborhood Planning (Homeowners Associations)
 The Town has many homeowners associations, some of which consist of small, loose
 affiliations of homeowners in a particular neighborhood, while others are larger and more
 formal in their structure. Many of the active associations focus on maintenance of
 properties within their association boundaries, considering issues such as general
 neighborhood character, building additions, landscaping, storage of boats and vehicles, and
 similar issues. Other associations respond to issues as they arise within their particular
 neighborhood. Town representatives meet with the leaders of the homeowners associations
 on a regular basis to discuss issues of concern to the neighborhoods.
 LOCAL DOCUMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS
 Marin County General Plan
 The Town of Corte Madera is one of 11 incorporated cities and towns within Marin County.
 Marin County’s unincorporated lands adjoin Corte Madera on its western border.
 Marin County is in the process of updating its General Plan. Marin’s Draft Countywide
 Plan focuses largely on sustainability with updated elements addressing current issues.
 Issues emphasized include: traffic congestion (specifically, Highway 101 during rush hour)
 and the expansion of public transportation systems; affordable housing needs; energy
 conservation; and the preservation of Marin’s natural beauty.
 Neighboring Cities General Plans
 The Cities of Mill Valley and Larkspur and the Town of Tiburon are adjacent to Corte
 Madera. Due to their locations, each of these jurisdictions’ General Plans is relevant to the
 Corte Madera General Plan. In particular, shared land-use related issues between Larkspur
 and Corte Madera include shared public school acreage, police services, and open space.
 KEY LAND USE REGULATORY AGENCIES (LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL)
 Association of Bay Area Governments
 The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) was established in 1961 to protect local
 control, plan for the future, and promote cooperation on area wide issues. ABAG is the
 regional representative of the Bay Area, and its members consist of all cities and counties in
 the Bay Area. As such, state and federal governments have designated ABAG as the official
 comprehensive planning agency for the Bay Area. Its Regional Plan provides a policy guide
 for Bay Area municipalities.

Bay Area Air Quality Management District
The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) regulates air quality within the
greater Bay Area. Among its responsibilities are preparation and implementation of air
quality regulations and plans intended to reduce air pollutants.
Bay Conservation and Development Commission
The Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) was established in 1965 to
prevent the unnecessary filling of San Francisco Bay and to increase public access to and
along the Bay shoreline. BCDC has jurisdiction over development in shoreline areas within
a band measured 100 feet landward of and parallel to the shoreline of the Bay.
Filling, dredging, new construction, major remodeling, changes in land use, and
subdivisions within this area are subject to review and approval by BCDC.             BCDC
implements the San Francisco Bay Plan, originally adopted in 1968 and periodically
updated, as its policy framework. The Plan focuses on water quality, size of the Bay,
marshes and mudflats, and related issues.
California Department of Transportation
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is responsible for interregional
transportation services, including highways, railways and associated structures. Highway
101, which runs on a north-south alignment through Corte Madera, is a Caltrans maintained
highway. Land use changes along the corridor are subject to review by Caltrans, among
other governmental agencies.

 Federal Emergency Management Agency
 As a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), Corte Madera is required
 to adhere to floodplain management policies that represent sound land use practices. The
 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), through the Federal Insurance
 Administration, administers the NFIP. FEMA produces Flood Insurance Rate Maps
 (FIRMs) for the communities participating in the NFIP, which identify flood hazard areas
 and restrict development in these areas.
 California Department of Fish and Game
 The Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is responsible for the conservation, protection and
 management of wildlife, native plants, and habitat of the State that are necessary to
 maintain biologically sustainable populations. It acts as advisor to other permitting
 agencies and enforces its own regulations. Permits issued to development projects by the
 Department of Fish and Game include Incidental Take Permits, for the taking of threatened
 and endangered species, and Streambed Alteration Agreements. The Department can also
 enforce against discharges into waterbodies that impact aquatic life.

 2.0 LAND USE
 While a balanced jobs:housing ratio is generally considered a positive factor for a
 community, the higher number of jobs in Corte Madera compared to residents results in
 increased local traffic congestion.
 The Town’s density and distribution of land uses in the future may contribute to air
 pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Recent research at the time of this General Plan
 has found that there is a connection between both density and local jobs with vehicle miles
 traveled (VMT). Residents tend to drive less and shorter distances if job opportunities and
 shopping opportunities are close to where they live. Studies show that the number of VMT
 and vehicle trips tends to decline as accessibility, density and mixed land use increase in an
 urban environment.
 According to the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), the population of Corte
 Madera is projected to grow to just over 10,000 by 2025 (an average increase of 0.4% per
 year). The Housing Element projects that the greatest increases in population levels over the
 next 40 years will be among elderly and young adult households. The Marin Commission
 on Aging (MCA) predicts that by the year 2020, one third of Marin County residents will be
 over the age of 60.
 The majority of households in Corte Madera (65%) are family households, and an additional
 25% are persons living alone. Marin County and Corte Madera have lower average
 household sizes than other portions of the Bay Area. Household size in Corte Madera is
 currently 2.43 persons, which is identical to that for all of Marin County. This size is
 projected to decrease to 2.37 persons by 2020, while average household size in Marin
 County is projected to decrease to 2.39 persons.
 INCOME
 The median household income in Corte Madera in 2000 was $79,839. The majority of
 households in Corte Madera are achieving moderate- and above moderate-income, and are
 headed by citizens between the ages of 35-54. The 2000 census estimated that 36% of
 existing Corte Madera households fell into the extremely low-, very low-, and low-income
 categories.
 EMPLOYMENT
 In the year 2000, 5,378 (58%) of Corte Madera’s residents were employed. This ratio has
 stayed fairly constant over time and is similar to the ratio for Marin County as a whole.
 Differences exist, however, in total jobs. Corte Madera provided jobs for 9,630 people in
 2000, almost twice the number of its employed residents and more than twice the number of
 its households. The majority of these jobs (approximately 42%) are in the retail sector (see
 Figure 2.3), and are filled by workers from outside of Corte Madera. The second largest,
 and fastest growing, sector is service, accounting for almost 28% of jobs. Agriculture and
 mining (0.3%) and manufacture and wholesale (8.1%) are minor sectors.

Marin County, in contrast, had fewer total jobs (123,000) than employed residents (141,000)
in 2000. The dominant sector is service, (45% of jobs), followed by retail, which provides
approximately 22% of County jobs. The agriculture/mining and manufacture/wholesale
sectors are minor job sources.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Corte Madera’s location is an advantage for its retail economy. Corte Madera has two
freeway exits and shares a third with Larkspur, is within 10 miles of the Golden Gate
Bridge, and has the first regional shopping centers north of San Francisco that have
adequate parking and are perceived as being safe, clean, and well maintained.

Corte Madera’s retail sector is the predominant influence on its economy, as well as the
major generator of sales tax revenues to the Town. Two regional shopping centers
dominate the retail environment: The Village at Corte Madera, and Corte Madera Town
Center.

 2.0 LAND USE
 Corte Madera’s retail economy is constrained by limited space for new or expanded
 development. Given that the Town is essentially built out, there is limited room for
 additional large-scale commercial development. Existing commercial and office centers
 could be redeveloped if landowner and market interests support such actions. Corte
 Madera has recently seen more opportunity for success in small, high-end retail shops, as
 well as office and service sector developments.
 Corte Madera’s vacancy rate in retail and office commercial tends to parallel but stay below
 the San Francisco North Bay Area average. For example, Corte Madera currently (Summer
 2004) has a 10% vacancy rate, while the North Bay Area has close to 17%. This reflects the
 Town’s favorable conditions within the region.
 HOUSING
 Housing Stock
 Corte Madera offers approximately 3,900 homes, 80% of which are single-family, detached
 houses. The majority of these were built between 1950 and 1970 (50.5%). More recently, an
 additional 189 units were constructed between 1990 and 2000, 81% of which were single-
 family and 19% of which were multi-family. Renovating the existing built environment,
 specifically existing residences, offers an opportunity for the Town to promote energy
 efficiency.       Chapter 3 (Resource Conservation and Sustainability) and Chapter 5
 (Community Design) of this Plan address energy conservation and green building
 principles in further detail.
 Housing Types and Costs
 The majority of housing units in Corte Madera are owner-occupied, single-family homes.
 Table 2.2 represents existing housing types.

Work-Force Housing
The average cost of homes and rental units in Marin County is high compared to income
levels, and approximately 28,000 workers commute into Marin County daily.
Within Corte Madera, average wage rates do not allow the typical worker to purchase a
home in the Town. Many of the Town’s residents have higher wage rates tied to
employment centers elsewhere in the Bay Area; approximately 85 percent of the employed
residents in Corte Madera work outside the Town, and 48 percent work outside Marin
County. Most of the people who work within Town commute in and out of Corte Madera
daily to reach their jobs, causing high VMT and vehicle trips. Increasing the amount of
work force and affordable housing is one way to reduce the number of job-related VMT.
Encouraging higher density in the Town’s built environment where appropriate and
supporting housing that is affordable for the local workforce, are strategies to reduce criteria
pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions
Housing Needs
ABAG determines each City’s and County’s “regional fair share” of the projected future
housing needs for the Bay Area. These estimates are based on the overall regional housing
need number as established by the State of California. ABAG allocates “fair shares” to local
jurisdictions based on four factors:
     ♦ The vacancy rate in each town and its existing housing needs
     ♦ The projected growth in the number of households
     ♦ The local and regional income distribution
     ♦ The need for housing generated by local job growth.
Table 2.3 summarizes fair share housing needs as determined by ABAG.

 2.0 LAND USE
 In addition to accommodating overall housing needs, Corte Madera is responsible for
 planning housing for special needs groups. These groups include the local workforce,
 seniors, people living with disabilities, farm workers, homeless persons, people with
 HIV/AIDS or other illnesses, people in need of mental health care, single parent families,
 single persons with no children, and large households. Special needs housing is often
 enriched to provide services that promote independent living.
 Table 2.4 summarizes existing special needs housing, and is of particular relevance because
 of the anticipated increase in this population as society ages.

 HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS
 Land and development costs are higher in Corte Madera than in many other Bay Area
 municipalities. The amount of vacant land in the Town is limited. Most remaining lots are
 characterized by development-inhibiting properties such as steep slopes, irregular
 topography, Bay mud, or slide-prone areas. Costs for vacant land are estimated at
 approximately $1 million per acre (Corte Madera Housing Element, 2002).
 The Town’s adopted Housing Element includes policies to provide additional sites for
 multiple-family housing, and to allow increased densities to make affordable housing
 feasible. Policies are included to promote mixed-use sites that can effectively provide
 higher-density housing opportunities. Additionally, infrastructure, services and utilities are
 available to adequately serve in-fill development in the Town.
 Available Land and Ability to Meet “Fair Share” Housing Needs
 The Background Report for the Corte Madera General Plan Update identified vacant lands
 within the Town. Within these areas, several sites were identified in the 2002 Housing
 Element as potential sites for affordable housing units in Corte Madera. These sites are
 listed in Table 2.5.

 LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
 The Town of Corte Madera has identified 15 land use designations to describe typical land
 uses accommodated within the Town. The following designations are used to define the
 type, intensity, general distribution and general location of land uses proposed by the
 General Plan. While each designation identifies the intended range of land uses, the Zoning
 Ordinance will identify allowable, conditionally allowable and prohibited uses, as well as
 establishing development standards.

Residential Designations
Open Residential
Open Residential land use is intended for areas with special characteristics such as steep
slopes or potentially unstable soils or geologic conditions. This designation is also intended
for areas having special open space value due to their visual character or habitat resource
potential, including site proximity to regional open space areas. Single-family houses and
accessory residential uses with very low intensity characteristics (such as low parking
generation) are allowed, including second residential units. Minimum lot size is five acres,
but smaller existing parcels would not be precluded from developing one housing unit.
Minimum Lot Size: Five acres
Residential Development Density: From 0 to 0.2 dwelling units per gross acre
Approximate Population Density: Up to 2.5 persons per five acres, or up to 0.5 persons per acre
Applicable Zoning District: R-1-C (Open Residential District)
Hillside Residential
This residential designation applies to areas located in the Chapman Hill and Christmas
Tree Hill areas of Town. These areas are generally characterized by unique development
constraints, including steep slopes, ridgelines, limited accessibility, and limited
infrastructure capacity. Development within these areas is limited to single-family homes
and related accessory uses that have low intensity characteristics, including second
residential units.
Minimum Lot Size: 20,000 square feet
Residential Development Density: From 0.2 to 2.2 dwelling units per net acre
Approximate Population Density: From 0.5 to 5.5 persons per acre

 2.0 LAND USE
 Applicable Zoning Districts: C-2 (Regional Shopping District); AHMU (Affordable Housing Mixed
 Use District); PD (Planned Development Overlay District); BRNH (Baylands Risk Zone and
 Natural Habitat Overlay District)
 Mixed-Use – Gateway Area
 This designation applies to the 4.5 acre WinCup property at the northeast corner of the
 intersection of Tamal Vista Boulevard and Wornum Drive. This designation is intended to
 allow the continued use of the existing office, manufacturing, warehouse, and storage
 activities of the land, or a similar but less intense commercial/storage use. Should the
 property be redeveloped the mixed land use designation encourages higher-density
 residential development in conjunction with local-serving commercial uses, to promote
 efficient use of land resources, pedestrian and bicycle friendly environment, minimization of
 the visual impact of parked automobiles, and promote the use of transit over the private
 automobile.
 The Mixed-Use Gateway designation includes local-serving commercial uses (such as small
 retailers, restaurants, and cafes; spa, bicycle shop, convenience grocery stores; and
 residential support services such as dry cleaners, shoe repair, banks, and beauty saloons)
 and higher residential density uses combined in a single building or on a single site in an
 integrated development pattern.
 Minimum Lot Size: 20,000 square feet
 Non-Residential Floor Area Ratio: Up to 0.34
 Residential Development Density: From 25.1 to 40.0 dwelling units per gross acre.
 Approximate Population Density: 40 to 98 persons per gross acre.
 Applicable Zoning Districts: M (Light Industrial), MUGD (Mixed Use Gateway District); PD
 (Planned Development Overlay District).
 Mixed-Use: Old Corte Madera Square
 This designation is intended for areas fronting on or near Old Corte Madera Square, where
 local-serving commercial uses (such as retailers, small restaurants, grocery stores, drug
 stores, beauty salons, cleaners and banks) and residential uses may be combined in a single
 building or on a single site in an integrated development pattern. A “single site” may
 include contiguous properties. Development standards will allow for flexibility in
 application of development standards, and reduced and shared parking based on the use
 mix. This designation is intended to encourage residential development in conjunction with
 local-serving commercial uses or redevelopment, to promote efficient use of land resources,
 pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, minimization of the visual impacts of automobiles, and
 compatibility with the existing character of Old Corte Madera Square. Implementation of
 this approach shall be achieved through preparation of a Community Plan (Policy LU-1.4).
 Minimum Lot Size: 8,000 square feet
 Floor Area Ratio: Up to 1.0

Overlay Zone); H-P (Historic Preservation Overlay District); also, the Town will amend the Zoning
Code to include MRX (Mixed Use District)
Mixed-Use Commercial
This designation is intended to support infill activities, and site and building redevelopment
of existing neighborhood commercial centers and along commercial corridors. Allowable
uses include office, light industrial (non-manufacturing), and commercial services, as well
as new housing developments. The designation is intended to encourage a variety of
community activities and services to co-exist in close proximity to one-another (such as jobs,
housing and services), thereby reducing the need for extensive automobile travel. Reduced
parking standards may be allowed when the site is located within 0.25 mile of a transit stop.
Minimum Lot Size: 6,000 square feet

 COMMUNITY PLAN STUDY AREA MAPS
 Public Resources Code §21083.3 authorizes cities to adopt Community Plans to implement
 the General Plan in designated areas. A Community Plan is intended to provide more finite
 specification of the types of uses to be permitted, development standards (setbacks, heights,
 landscape, architecture, etc.), and circulation and infrastructure improvements.            A
 Community Plan is adopted by resolution as a document of policies and standards.
 The Corte Madera General Plan identifies four areas for which Community Plans shall be
 prepared:
      ♦ Old Corte Madera Square Area
      ♦ San Clemente Drive/Paradise Drive/Koch Road Area
      ♦ Fifer/Tamal Vista Area
      ♦ Tamalpais Drive/Casa Buena Drive area
 Figures 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 depict the study area boundaries within which Community
 Plans are recommended.
 Detailed descriptions of the proposed Community Plans are included in the Goals, Policies
 and Implementation Programs described in Section 2.7.

2.7         GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS FOR
            LAND USE
GOAL LU-1
A mix and distribution of land uses that enhances community character and serves the
needs of existing and future Town residents.
Land Use Policies and Implementation Programs:
POLICY LU-1.1
Maintain and implement the General Plan Land Use Diagram that describes the distribution
and location of land uses prescribed by General Plan policies (see Figure 2.4). Land use
designations are generalized groupings of land uses and titles that define a predominant
land use type. Land use designations are defined in Section 2.5 of the General Plan. Only
allow development that is consistent with the Land Use Diagram and the land use
designations. All proposed projects must meet density, floor area ratio, and other standards
governing the applicable land use designation.
        Implementation Program LU-1.1.a             Ordinance Revisions
        Prepare and adopt revisions to the Municipal Code, including the Zoning and
        Subdivision Ordinances, that organize and update existing resolutions and
        ordinances of the Town to ensure consistency with the General Plan, including land
        uses, lot sizes and floor area ratios. Uses and structures made non-conforming by
        adoption of the General Plan will be allowed to be continued, and further addressed
        in the Zoning Ordinance update.
                Responsibility:            Planning and Building Department
                Timeframe:                 Within two years of General Plan adoption
                Resources:                 General Plan Maintenance Fee
        Implementation Program LU-1.1.b             Mixed-Use Zone
        Amend the Corte Madera Zoning Ordinance to add a Mixed-Use Zone to implement
        the Mixed-Use designations, and apply this Zoning to lands so designated on the
        Land Use Diagram. Corollary changes to parking provisions of the Zoning
        Ordinance shall also be made to ensure adequate set-aside of parking spaces for
        residential uses in mixed-use developments.
                Responsibility:            Planning and Building Department
                Timeframe:                 Simultaneous with General Plan adoption

Community Plan Policies and Implementation Programs:
POLICY LU-1.4:
Identify opportunities to achieve desired land uses and physical improvements in and
around Old Corte Madera Square.
    Policy Intent: The area surrounding Old Corte Madera Square, depicted in Figure 2.5,
    effectively serves as one of the "centers" of the Town. It achieves this in part through the
    many historic buildings that adjoin the Square (a reminder of the Town’s development
    origins), in the varied retail and service establishments surrounding the Square, and by
    the primary focal and gathering point in the center of the Square, Menke Park.
    Community events are held at the Park, including the Town’s annual Oktoberfest
    celebration.
    The Town is committed to enhancing the area to promote pedestrian and bicycle activity
    and local businesses, and to improve circulation along the area roads. Circulation
    around Old Corte Madera Square is the focus of several policies included in Chapter 4
    (Circulation). Physically, future development would occur as infill, consistent in scale
    and character with the existing buildings. Expansion of existing uses to include
    residential units would enhance the area's activity and provide additional housing
    opportunities.     Future uses within the area should be considered in parallel with
    enhancement of opportunities for existing uses.
        Implementation Program LU-1.4.a:            Prepare Community Plan
        Prepare a Community Plan for the Old Corte Madera Square area to achieve the
        following objectives:
        Development Objectives:
               Recognize the significance of historic architecture around the Square when
                considering new development.
               Create opportunities for mixed retail, service, professional and residential
                land uses around the Square, including potential for development of
                affordable housing.
               Maintain a relatively low intensity of land use, similar in nature to current
                use in and around the Square, in order to preserve the established character
                in the area. Floor Area Ratios (FAR) shall not exceed a maximum FAR of 1.0,
                subject to Town review of development plans.
               Enhance the passive recreational value of Menke Park as a quiet, scenic
                resource.
               Create an environment to enhance business success around the Square.

 2.0 LAND USE
                 Identify uses that will enhance the Square’s attraction to Town residents.
                 Develop a locational signage program and provide gateway elements.
                 Utilize Design Guidelines for the Square area to maintain the diverse
                  architectural styles found in the area and enhance the appearance of new
                  development and rehabilitation of existing structures.
                 Future development within the Community Plan boundaries shall minimize
                  view impacts to properties with views of Mount Tamalpais and San Francisco
                  Bay through thoughtful building design and placement.
                 Undergrounding of utility lines.
         Traffic, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Objectives:
                 Improve traffic safety and flow around the Square.
                 Improve pedestrian and bicycle safety in and around the Square.
                 Improve the collective traffic, bicycle and pedestrian environment at the
                  intersection of Redwood and Corte Madera Avenues. This shall include
                  installation of accessible facilities for the disabled.
                 Calm traffic around the Square, through methods such as placement of parking
                  spaces, adding raised crosswalks, pedestrian islands, bulb-outs, pedestrian
                  controlled traffic signals, or pedestrian resting places.
                 Provide more convenient pedestrian access between Tamalpais Drive and First
                  Street. This may also include evaluation of a one-way, east-bound street
                  connection between First Street and Tamalpais Drive if pedestrian access and
                  safety can be improved.
                 Develop and implement a streetscape design program to enhance the pedestrian
                  environment and create an engaging gathering place.

POLICY LU-1.5:
Identify opportunities to achieve desired land uses and physical improvements in the San
Clemente Drive/Paradise Drive area.
    Policy Intent: The San Clemente Drive/Paradise Drive area, depicted in Figure 2.6,
    effectively functions as the southern "gateway" point to Bayside Corte Madera from
    Highway 101. The area currently serves various commercial, office and light industrial
    uses. The areas along San Clemente and Paradise Drives are included in the 1979 Town-
    adopted Specific Plan that focuses primarily upon design issues. This area was
    subsequently considered in the 1999 Draft San Clemente/Paradise Drive Specific Plan to
    respond to 1989 General Plan policies and the Corte Madera Bayfront Vision Plan. The
    Draft Specific Plan was not adopted.
    The Town is committed to encouraging mixed-use development in the area to more
    effectively showcase and link the area to adjacent commercial districts and residential
    neighborhoods. This includes recognition of the Town’s commitment to providing
    opportunities for development of affordable housing. Additionally, the Town wishes to
    enhance San Clemente Drive with “boulevard” streetscaping. Physically, future
    development would largely occur as infill (renovations of currently-developed sites), as
    well as improvements such as pedestrian-oriented plazas, walkways, and circulation
    spaces.
        Implementation Program LU-1.5.a:           Prepare Community Plan
        Prepare a Community Plan that encompasses lands in and around the San Clemente
        Drive/Paradise Drive area and which achieves the following objectives:
        Development Objectives:
               Develop the San Clemente/Paradise Drive Commercial Area as the gateway
                to Bayside Corte Madera.
               Allow for the intensity of land use to be relatively intense compared to
                current uses. Higher floor-area ratios (FARs) may be allowed, compared to
                existing development within the Community Plan area, and could include
                substantial redevelopment of existing sites. Higher FARs would be allowed
                when there is a demonstrated and extraordinary benefit provided to the
                Town in terms of job creation, exceptional design character, and other criteria
                established in the Community Plan related to redevelopment of existing sites,
                and where traffic and other environmental impacts can be mitigated to
                acceptable levels.
               Integrate existing land uses with infill development where feasible.

 2.0 LAND USE
                 Provide opportunity for development of housing as a means of reducing local-
                  area vehicle trips.
                 Provide locations for office and employment activities that are compatible with
                  the district and surrounding residential neighborhoods, and consistent with
                  underlying General Plan objectives for mixed uses.
                 Provide sufficient commercial services for adjacent residential neighborhoods.
                 Strengthen and upgrade the scenic quality of this area via improved maintenance
                  and intensity of landscaping along the freeway edges, especially at the south and
                  north entrances to the project area.
                 Limit the size and height of freeway-oriented signage. Adopt design guidelines
                  to improve the quality of signage in the Community Plan Area and reduce the
                  collective visual clutter of freeway-oriented signs.
                 Provide a clear implementation/phasing plan that creates a coherent image for
                  the area upon the phased completion of Community Plan area improvements.
         Traffic, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Objectives:
                 Widen and redevelop San Clemente Drive as a tree-lined boulevard, with
                  planted median, turning lanes, streetscaping, pedestrian and bicycle paths, while
                  also preserving the functionality of the street as an arterial.
                 Develop a central, pedestrian-oriented network of circulation linkages as the
                  focus of the mixed-use district.
                 Develop clear circulation linkages within the project boundaries, and access
                  points to Highway 101 and adjacent streets and boulevards. This may include
                  bicycle and pedestrian access across Highway 101 in the vicinity of the
                  Tamalpais Drive interchange.
                 Improve circulation within the area by installing medians and limiting the
                  number of driveway encroachments onto San Clemente Drive.
                 Develop bicycle linkages to the adjacent residential neighborhoods and to the
                  bicycle lane across San Clemente Drive.
                 Provide a high-quality pedestrian environment with wide sidewalks, safe street
                  crossings, street trees, pedestrian plazas, ample site landscaping and pedestrian
                  lighting. This shall include installation of accessible facilities for the disabled.
                 Provide pedestrian and bike connections to the adjacent residential
                  neighborhoods and mixed-use districts through enhancement of the Bayside
                  Trail Park and open space system.

POLICY LU-1.6:
Identify opportunities to achieve desired land uses and physical improvements in the Fifer
Avenue/Tamal Vista Boulevard area.
    Policy Intent: The Fifer Avenue/Tamal Vista Boulevard area, depicted in Figure 2.7,
    currently hosts a range of public facility, commercial service, and multi-family
    residential uses.
    The Town is committed to enhance the scenic character of the area via improved
    maintenance and intensity of landscaping, as well as to link the existing uses to adjacent
    mixed-use districts and residential neighborhoods. Additionally, the Town has
    identified opportunities for high-density, multi-unit residential uses in the area. Future
    infill development within the area should be considered in parallel with enhancement of
    opportunities for existing uses.
    The area may be impacted through changes to Highway 101 access. Planning and
    engineering studies conducted for the Highway 101/Sir Francis Drake Boulevard
    interchange may result in other interchange upgrades and modifications. Presently, the
    Town of Corte Madera, City of Larkspur and Marin County have agreed to a
    preliminary design that would create a full diamond interchange at Wornum Drive, and
    which would remove ramps to Fifer Avenue from the Highway. If such changes occur,
    they would have significant implications to vehicle access and land use opportunities in
    the Fifer Avenue/Tamal Vista Boulevard area, and should therefore be carefully
    considered in any final land use approach considered by the Town.
        Implementation Program LU-1.6.a:          Prepare Community Plan
        Prepare a Community Plan that encompasses lands in and around the Fifer
        Avenue/Tamal Vista Boulevard area and which achieves the following objectives:
Corte Madera                                                                       General Plan

 2.0 LAND USE
         Development Objectives:
                 Encourage infill development that is consistent with underlying General Plan
                  objectives for mixed uses.
                 Allow for the intensity of land use to be relatively intense compared to current
                  uses. Higher floor-area ratios (FARs) are anticipated compared to existing
                  development within the Community Plan area, and could include substantial
                  redevelopment of existing sites. Higher FARs would be allowed when there is a
                  demonstrated and extraordinary benefit provided to the Town in terms of job
                  creation, exceptional design character, and other criteria established in the
                  Community Plan, and where traffic and other environmental impacts can be
                  mitigated to acceptable levels.
                 Provide locations for office and employment activities that are compatible with
                  the area and surrounding residential neighborhoods. Consider provisions for
                  multi-family residential use.
                 Upgrade the scenic quality of the area via improved maintenance and intensity
                  of landscaping.
                 Limit the size and height of freeway-oriented signage. Adopt design guidelines
                  to improve the quality of signage in the Community Plan Area and reduce the
                  collective visual clutter of freeway-oriented signs.
                 Provide a clear implementation/phasing plan that creates a coherent image for
                  the area upon the phased completion of Community Plan area improvements.
         Traffic, Bicycle, and Pedestrian Objectives:
                 Develop clear circulation linkages and access points to adjacent streets and
                  boulevards, and between developments.
                 Develop a central, pedestrian-oriented network of circulation linkages as the
                  focus of the district.
                 Develop clear circulation and bicycle linkages to the adjacent residential
                  neighborhoods.
                 Provide a high quality pedestrian environment with wide sidewalks, safe street
                  crossings, street trees, pedestrian plazas, ample site landscaping and pedestrian
                  lighting. This shall include installation of accessible facilities for the disabled.

POLICY LU-1.7:
Identify opportunities to achieve desired land uses and physical improvements in the
Tamalpais Drive/Casa Buena Drive area
    Policy Intent: The Tamalpais Drive/Casa Buena Drive area, depicted in Figure 2.8, is an
    important gateway to the community. The Town Center shopping center is aesthetically
    attractive and commercially strong, and there is a slow revitalization trend among other
    commercial properties in the area. However, a number of retail and service buildings in
    the area are near the end of their economic life and are marginally blighted. Also the
    area is part of the US 101 Corridor Study of ramps and interchanges from Tamalpais
    Drive through Sir Francis Drake Boulevard. The Tamalpais Drive/Highway 101
    intersection and overpass may be rebuilt as a part of the Corridor study during the life
    of this General Plan. A Community Plan that includes a program of public
    improvements and zoning incentives will accelerate the revitalization of this area.
        Implementation Program LU-1.7.a:            Prepare Community Plan
        Prepare a Community Plan that encompasses lands in and around the Tamalpais
        Drive/Casa Buena Drive area and which achieves the following objectives:

 neighborhood, should be considered by conditional use permit. In no instance shall a
 supporting service use be allowed in a residential neighborhood if it would create an unsafe
 traffic or public safety condition.

Infill Development Policies and Implementation Programs:
GOAL LU-3
Infill development that achieves a more livable, sustainable community.
Policy Intent: The Town of Corte Madera is largely built-out with only a few vacant,
developable parcels remaining. In the future, all development will be “infill” on vacant land
that is surrounded by development, or privately funded redevelopment of previously
developed properties. Redevelopment infill will range from simple remodeling projects to
proposals that call for the complete demolition of existing properties and construction of
new buildings. The following policies and implementation programs are intended to ensure
that infill projects meet the community’s needs and complement the existing fabric of the
Town.
POLICY LU-3.1
Provide for infill development in core Town areas.
        Implementation Program LU-3.1.a:            Infill Locations
        The General Plan Land Use Element includes policies calling for preparation of
        Community Plans for several key areas, and encourages redevelopment of other
        lands in and around commercial and office core areas of the Town. In doing so, the
        General Plan purposefully creates greater potential for more intensive infill
        development of sites that may be underutilized. Infill development can help create
        areas that are more compact with a diverse mixture of land uses, improve
        connectivity between neighborhoods and uses, reduce traffic congestion and provide
        a greater range of community amenities. In keeping with stated goals, infill
        development in core areas should also provide for transit oriented development.
        Infill development may occur within the Town’s four Community Plan areas, and in
        the Mixed Use Commercial, Commercial Services, Region-Serving Commercial and
        Office land use designations. Additionally, redevelopment of older apartment
        complexes, in areas generally designated for Medium Density or High Density
        Residential, are acceptable infill developments if retaining or increasing the number
        of rental units, consistent with density criteria of the General Plan and state density
        bonus regulations.

         Implementation Program LU-3.2.a:             Infill Objectives
         Support infill development if findings can be made that the proposal is consistent
         with the infill goals and policies outlined herein, would be consistent with applicable
         provisions of the General Plan and would ensure land use compatibility with
         established neighborhood character. Approvals for infill development projects shall
         be based on findings of fact that the proposed projects have the potential to achieve
         one or more of the following attributes:
                Produce jobs for Town residents
                Create high density, market-rate and/or affordable housing
                Provide convenient access to transportation facilities and public transit, as well
                 as schools, shopping and other local destinations, as a means of increasing
                 residential density and commercial intensity
                Reduce automobile-oriented design
                Reduce creation of traffic congestion
                Utilize existing infrastructure systems
                Provide a desirable built environment, as described in LU-3.5, below

Larkspur School District
Neil Cummins Elementary School recently completed an $8.5 million modernization, which
is expected to ensure a facility that should be useable for the next twenty to thirty years.
Additionally, San Clemente School is located within the Town of Corte Madera and is
owned by the Larkspur School District. The building is currently leased to a private school.
Should future additional school facility space be necessary, the San Clemente School space
would allow the District to grow by 400 students, although significant building renovation
would be necessary.
Reed Union School District
The Facilities Master Plan for the Reed Union School District sets forth approximately $68
million of needed improvements to their schools. The work will be completed in phases,
and includes modernization, repairs, remodeling, replacement of heating and other systems,
and ensuring buildings are up to current fire, earthquake and Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) codes. The District’s Granada School campus is located within the Town limits,
with building space leased primarily to private day care schools.
Tamalpais Union School District Facilities
Redwood High School has experienced some growth in recent years, and may be at or near
capacity by 2005.
Private Schools
There are a number of private academic schools in Corte Madera serving preschool through
twelfth grade students. Lycee Francais La Persouse is an International French School,
leasing the San Clemente School, catering to students in preschool through the twelfth
grade. It has a French National Curriculum with a strong English program. Enrollment is
approximately 200 students.
Marin Montessori School is located at 5200 Paradise Drive in Corte Madera. The Allaire
School, located at 50 El Camino Drive in Corte Madera, is a Special Education Academic
school. The Marin Country Day School at 5221 Paradise Drive in Corte Madera offers
education services for pre-kindergarten through the eighth grade students. Two private
schools in Larkspur and Tiburon also serve Corte Madera school-aged children. There are
also several preschools in Corte Madera that provide education for pre-kindergarten
children.
Library Services
The Corte Madera Regional Library is located on Meadowsweet Drive and is a branch of the
Marin County Free Library system. The branch was opened in 1928. The Library’s current
building was built in 1971 and is nearly 10,000 square feet. Support organizations include
the Friends of the Marin County Library and the Friends of the Corte Madera Library.

 WATER SUPPLY AND TREATMENT
 Water Supply
 The Town of Corte Madera obtains its water supply from the Marin Municipal Water
 District, which serves central and southern Marin County. The District operates seven
 reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 79,566 acre-feet (25, 927 million gallons). Five of
 the District’s reservoirs are on Mt. Tamalpais and two are in western Marin County. The
 District is able to provide 75 percent of water usage from rainfall stored in the reservoirs on
 Mt. Tamalpais and west Marin County. In addition, the Water District obtains 6,800 acre-
 feet annually from the Russian River, as well as 10,000 acre-feet from average annual stream
 releases. Average annual use for the Marin Municipal Water District is 28,622 acre-feet, or
 8,784 million gallons.
 Marin County planning projections indicate that the Marin water sources, along with
 Russian River water rights, will provide a sufficient supply for at least the first few decades
 of the 21st century.
 Water Treatment
 Treatment of surface water from the Mt. Tamalpais watershed begins in the reservoirs,
 where the water is seasonally aerated to maintain a proper oxygen balance. The water then
 goes to the Bon Tempe Treatment Plant on Mt. Tamalpais or the San Geronimo Treatment
 Plant in Woodacre. Fluoride has been added to the treated water since 1972.
 Water imported from the Russian River is naturally filtered in the deep sand and gravel
 below the riverbed and requires no further clarification. This water enters the District’s
 system at the Ignacio treatment facility, where water quality is monitored, and treatment is
 similar to the reservoir plants.
 Water Distribution
 The three potable water treatment plants have a total capacity of 82 million gallons. The
 pipeline system pumping units can deliver up to 38,000 gallons per minute. Because of
 Marin County’s hilly terrain, about 90 percent of the water must be pumped at least once
 before it reaches the tap. The District uses 146 storage tanks and 890 miles of pipeline.
 The majority of residences in Corte Madera receive water service from the Ross Valley
 gravity system. The system is fed by water from the San Geronimo treatment Plant via the
 Fairfax Transmission Line and from the Ross Reservoir. Several transmission lines wind
 their way through Ross Valley to Greenbrae and Corte Madera. This system is used to serve
 all properties up to an elevation of about 200 feet. The system also provides capacity for
 pumps to take water and boost it to elevations of about 500 feet to systems serving higher
 elevations.

WASTEWATER CONVEYANCE AND TREATMENT
Wastewater Conveyance
Sanitary District No. 2 of Marin County, a member of the Central Marin Sanitation Agency
(CMSA), provides wastewater services in Corte Madera. The CMSA, formed in 1979, is a
public joint powers agency of Ross Valley Sanitary District, San Rafael Sanitation District,
Sanitary District No. 2, and the City of Larkspur.
Within Corte Madera, sewage is conveyed mostly through a series of 6-, 8- and 10-inch clay
pipes in City streets and related easements to larger collection systems, connected to a series
of pump stations located throughout the Town. In 2006 the Paradise Pump Station was
completely rebuilt with state of the art mechanical and electrical components. This
increased the capacity and added redundancy to the pumping system.
Wastewater Treatment
The CMSA Subregional Wastewater Treatment Plant, located in San Rafael, treats sewage
from member Districts conveyed from several remote pump stations. The Treatment Plant
is capable of processing 125 million gallons of sewage per day during peak rainfall periods,
but has average flows of less than 10 million gallons per day.
CMSA and the Marin Municipal Water District are considering a reclamation plant where
reclaimed wastewater will be used for non-potable uses such as irrigation of pastureland,
parks, schools, and industrial complexes.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND
        SUSTAINABILITY

                     CHAPTER 3 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND
                                                                     SUSTAINABILTY
3.1         INTRODUCTION
This chapter includes policies and programs that promote
community sustainability and effective management of
renewable and non-renewable natural resources through
energy conservation, solid waste management and
recycling, natural area resource conservation, and
preservation of cultural and historic resources. It meets the
State’s General Plan requirements for the Conservation and Open Space elements.
As part of the General Plan update process, Corte Madera residents expressed an interest in
moving from the protection-oriented environmental framework of the 1989 General Plan to
a more proactive approach that would advance the principles of community sustainability
through strategies that conserve and enhance local natural resources.
The strategy in this Chapter is based on the understanding that conserving significant
natural resources and biological diversity improves recreational opportunities, sustains
natural systems, reduces negative environmental impacts, and improves overall quality of
life.
Scientific consensus supports the conclusion that humans are impacting global climate by
increasing greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. Climate change is a global problem,
and GHGs impact the global atmosphere; this means that activities that take place in one
part of the world impact the entire atmosphere, unlike criteria pollutants which have an
impact on local air quality. It will take a global effort to reduce GHG emissions to the point
where global climate does not pose a serious threat to our communities. Climate change has
and will continue to impact the environment in a variety of ways, and will also cause
economic and social effects. Potential climate change impacts directly affecting Corte
Madera include the following: sea level rise and increased flooding, water supply issues,
wildfire risk, public health concerns, air quality threats, more intense storm events, and
energy demand and supply. This chapter discusses the climate change issue and includes
policies and programs directed at mitigation. Other chapters in the General Plan address
measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as promoting mixed use and infill
development, transportation alternatives, transit oriented development, and the creation of
Design Guidelines that incorporate resource efficiency.
3.2         REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
The required General Plan provisions for Conservation and Open Space are included in this
chapter, and provide direction for the conservation, preservation, development, and
utilization of natural resources. Government Code Sections 65302(d) and 65302(e) require
that a general plan include:
Corte Madera                                                                       General Plan
April 2009
                                               3-1

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
         “A conservation element for the conservation, development, and utilization of
         natural resources…”
         “An open space element as provided in Article 10.5”
 Guiding policies include comprehensive and long-range preservation and conservation
 measures with regard to open-space lands (§65563).
 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
 There are numerous local, state and federal agencies and laws that regulate biological
 resources, including:
      ♦ State Department of Fish and Game
      ♦ Bay Conservation and Development Commission
      ♦ U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
 Appendix A to the General Plan lists various agencies and laws protecting biological
 resources, including information related to endangered and threatened plant and animal
 species. The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is the overriding State Law that
 requires analysis of impacts on biological and natural area resources. More detailed
 discussion about this topic is covered in Section 3.11 Natural Area Resource Conservation.
 WASTE MANAGEMENT RESOURCES
 The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939) required each city and
 county to divert 50 percent of its waste stream from landfill disposal by the year 2000.
 Diversion may include reducing the total amount of waste generated through source
 reduction, recycling, composting, and transformation programs. In 1992, Marin’s eleven
 cities and the County adopted a single Source Reduction and Recycling (SSR) Element that
 determined current diversion rates, evaluated alternative diversion programs, and set forth
 a course of action. More detailed discussions about this topic are covered in Section 3.9
 Solid Waste Management and Recycling.
 HISTORIC RESOURCES
 The Town contains historic structures that are important to community identity. The
 General Plan provides the opportunity to recognize and preserve structures and artifacts
 from the Town’s origin in the late 1800s. Additionally, protection of significant historic
 resources is afforded under provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA),
 which requires planning agencies to carefully consider the potential effects of a project on
 historical resources. More detailed discussion about this topic is covered in Section 3.17
 Cultural and Historic Resources.

                             3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
CLIMATE CHANGE
Among the evolving regulations that affect local General Plans are State regulations that
specifically address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. At the time of this
General Plan Update, there are no regulations setting ambient air quality emissions
standards for greenhouse gases.
Executive Order S-3-05
Executive Order S-3-05, which was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger in 2005, proclaims
that California is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It declares that increased
temperatures could reduce the Sierra’s snowpack, further exacerbate California’s air quality
problems, and potentially cause a rise in sea levels. To combat those concerns, the Executive
Order established total greenhouse gas emission targets. Specifically, emissions are to be
reduced to the 2000 level by 2010, the 1990 level by 2020, and to 80% below the 1990 level by
2050. To comply with the Executive Order, the Secretary of the CalEPA created a Climate
Action Team (CAT) made up of members from various state agencies and commissions.
CAT released its first report in March 2006. The report proposed to achieve the targets by
building on voluntary actions of California businesses, local government and community
actions, as well as through state incentive and regulatory programs.
Assembly Bill 32, The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006
In September 2006, Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 32, the California Global Warming
Solutions Act of 2006. The State legislature recognizes the importance of the issue of climate
change, as AB 32 states: “Global warming poses a serious threat to the economic well-being,
public health, natural resources, and the environment of California.”
AB 32 requires that statewide GHG emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by the year 2020.
This reduction will be accomplished through an enforceable statewide cap on GHG
emissions that will be phased in starting in 2012. To effectively implement the cap, AB 32
directs ARB to develop and implement regulations to reduce statewide GHG emissions
from stationary sources.
State Attorney General
At the time of this General Plan Update, recent legislation in the form of AB 32 has
prompted the California State Attorney General’s office to send comment letters to local
lead agencies regarding incorporating an analysis of GHG emissions and climate change
mitigation measures in CEQA and long range planning documents. While the Attorney
General has focused some comment letters towards specific development projects, much of
the focus has been on long range planning documents such as General Plans.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 The Attorney General’s office has suggested that by law, a General Plan must discuss
 climate change, and include meaningful, tangible, enforceable, and funded policies,
 implementation mechanisms and timelines.
 3.3         SETTING
 The transition area from the San Francisco Bay tidal wetlands and marshes to the upland
 grassy hillsides and oak woodlands has created many ecological niches in the Corte Madera
 region. Wetlands provide plant and wildlife habitat that aid in water purification by
 assimilating waste, and trapping and neutralizing pollutants from urban runoff. Wetlands
 contribute to groundwater recharge, protect the shoreline from wave action, and enhance
 recreational values as open space and wildlife sanctuaries. Vegetation in estuarine mudflats
 and the adjacent alluvial plains contributes plant materials that form the critical base of
 watery food chains and provides more oxygen per acre than any other natural ecosystem.
 Local marshlands assist flood control by providing a buffer between the Bay and developed
 portions of Corte Madera, and act as retention ponds for storm water overflow.
 A variety of plants and wildlife occur in the Town of Corte Madera. In some cases, plants
 and wildlife are unique to the Corte Madera region and the Mount Tamalpais watershed.
 Species that are unique to the region are considered locally rare and are protected under the
 California Environmental Quality Act or the California Endangered Species Act. The State

3.4             CLIMATE CHANGE
Scientific consensus supports the conclusion that humans are impacting global climate by
increasing greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change’s (IPCC)1 Fourth Assessment Report includes the latest scientific research
available at the time of this General Plan. The Report states that global atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have significantly increased
since 1750 as a result of human activities. Fossil fuel use and land use changes are the
primary sources of global increases in carbon dioxide concentration; agriculture is the
primary source of increases in methane and nitrous oxide2. The Report concludes that
warming of the climate system is “unequivocal” and scientists agree that there is a 90
percent chance that this warming is the net effect of human activities since 1750.2
California is highly ranked in the world for the amount of GHG emissions emitted in the
state, but has taken the lead in creating stringent GHG emissions reduction policies. 3
Assembly Bill 32 requires the implementation of measures to reduce the state’s GHG
emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 – an expected 25 percent reduction. The main source of
atmospheric carbon dioxide in California is the burning of fossil fuels, comprising 98% of
gross carbon dioxide emissions.4
Quantifying, managing and reducing GHG will help protect the health of the community,
ecosystems, and biodiversity from potentially dangerous climate changes. Reducing GHG
also contributes to the achievement of various municipal goals such as improving air and
water quality and fostering economic development.
3.5             COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY
Sustainability is an evolving concept that is defined in different ways, since it has both
general and specific applications. In its broadest sense, global environmental sustainability
is derived from an understanding that there are finite natural resources on this earth and
that these life sustaining resources must not be consumed faster than they can be naturally
replaced. Equally important, there must not be irreversible harm caused to sensitive
ecological habitats or environmental systems beyond their capacity to sustain human life.
1 The IPCC is a body created by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, and
was created to assess peer reviewed scientific and technical studies and reports in order to present “comprehensive, objective,
open and transparent” information on climate change.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 For the purposes of this General Plan, sustainability can be defined as a balance of the built
 environment, socioeconomic activities, and the natural environment that assures the natural
 resources are managed and protected so they can continue to sustain life.
 As a local community, Corte Madera is limited in how much it can implement this
 overarching concept. The community can, though, focus its efforts on local policies and
 programs that take steps to encourage and advance sustainability principles both locally
 and regionally.
 Corte Madera residents understand that local decisions regarding land use, housing,
 transportation, open space conservation, sensitive habitat preservation, recycling, waste
 management, water conservation and energy conservation have significant cumulative
 impacts on the regional health and quality of life. By taking steps to encourage and advance
 sustainability principles, the overall quality of life will be improved today and for
 generations to come.
 Numerous sustainability ideas and approaches are integrated into all chapters of the
 General Plan, and address a variety of issues such as infill construction and redevelopment,
 provision of infrastructure, transportation modes and parking, and open space and parks.
 A “Sustainable” Corte Madera, under this General Plan, will utilize various strategies to
 conserve and enhance local resources and safeguard the environment as a means of
 improving the livability and quality of life for Town residents.

3.7             ENERGY
Today’s primary pattern of energy use, using non-renewable energy sources, cannot be
sustained over the long run. Greater use of alternative energy sources will likely be part of
our future community and economy. Additionally, fossil fuel consumption generates waste
products that are toxic and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. The
environmental toll and health problems associated with toxic releases and climate change
may incur irreparable damage. Climate change, air pollution from burning fossil fuels, and
the breakdown of living systems due to the buildup of toxins are some of the costliest
problems community members face. Addressing the need to change can begin with a
community’s efforts to improve energy efficiency.
Energy efficiency means using less energy to perform the same function, while energy
conservation connotes “doing without” in order to save energy. Minimizing transportation-
related energy consumption and reducing energy consumption in buildings are examples of
important conservation techniques that Corte Madera can utilize. Factors that influence the
Town’s local energy-related activities include energy reliability, production, consumption,
and conservation. Increased awareness of energy use will help the Town’s efforts at
conserving resources and establishing sustainable policies for energy production and
consumption.
GREEN BUILDING
According to the US Green Building Council at the time this General Plan Update, buildings
in the United States use almost 40 percent of our nation’s total primary energy budget,
produce at least 30 percent of our greenhouse gases, and create nearly 30 percent of our
waste.5 The US Department of Energy has concluded that buildings in the nation currently
use more energy than any other economic sector, including transportation and industry.6
Innovative and affordable efficient building strategies are now available to reduce the
building sector’s impact on the indoor and outdoor environment.
Performance based programs such as the US Green Building Council’s Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification system offer opportunities to
increase a building’s environmental performance and improve occupant health through
efficient (also known as “green”) building strategies. Cities and federal agencies are
increasingly adopting the LEED or other rating systems for their buildings. The State of
California Governor’s Executive Order (S-20-04) calls for all newly constructed or renovated
State buildings over 10,000 square feet to meet LEED Silver criteria, and a Green Building

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 3.9             SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING
 The environmental movement helped to establish the connections between being a “throw-
 away” society, the dangers of landfilling and incineration, and resource-conservation issues.
 Natural resources, non-renewable petroleum reserves, and agricultural topsoil are buried in
 landfills at colossal rates. Independent recycling centers have been opened to remedy this
 trend. Most towns and cities now offer curbside residential recycling programs and many
 businesses have established recycling programs in the workplace.
 The fundamental challenge of achieving sustainable urban waste management is in finding
 solutions to the increased production of disposable products and the use of packaging as a
 marketing tool. Approaches to reducing waste in Corte Madera can include purchasing
 durable, repairable, and reusable products, and purchasing products made from recycled
 materials. These strategies, combined with improved recycling collection and processing
 programs, will help to reduce Corte Madera’s waste stream and conserve resources.
 SOLID WASTE COLLECTION
 Mill Valley Refuse Service provides waste collection service in Corte Madera, and is one of
 seven privately owned waste haulers in Marin County. Redwood Landfill, located in
 Novato, is used for more than 95 percent of Marin County’s waste disposal, including the
 Town of Corte Madera. In July 1995, Redwood Landfill was issued a new Solid Waste
 Facility permit, which extended the landfill site life to the year 2039. The landfill has
 projected capacity to meet service needs for Corte Madera for the next several decades. Both
 Mill Valley Refuse and the Redwood Landfill meet applicable federal, state and local laws
 related to handling and disposal of solid waste.
 RECYCLING
 The monitoring and evaluation program described in the Multi-Jurisdictional Source
 Reduction and Recycling Element for Marin County, which also applies to the cities in the
 County, achieved compliance with requirements of AB 939. AB 939 mandated that
 communities divert at least 50 percent of their waste streams by the year 2000; Corte Madera
 diverted 56 percent of its waste stream by the year 2000, while Marin County as a whole
 diverted 63 percent.
 Marin Recycling and Resource Recovery Association (MRRRA) operates the Marin
 Recycling Center where much of the material collected by curbside recycling in Corte
 Madera is processed. MRRRA operates a curbside recycling program for all residences in
 Corte Madera. Service includes weekly curbside collection of newspaper, cardboard,
 container glass, ferrous, aluminum and plastic. Other recycling activities in Corte Madera
 include aluminum and glass buyback centers, paper and cardboard recycling from
 commercial operations, and residential and commercial wood recycling. The Town’s Public
 Works Department composts a portion of landscape wastes from public parks.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 3.11        NATURAL AREA RESOURCE CONSERVATION
 The environmental setting for the Town of Corte Madera can be divided into the following
 categories:
     ♦ Wetlands, including tidal wetlands and waters and freshwater wetlands and drainages
     ♦ Open Space, which includes hillsides and ridgelines
     ♦ Scenic Resources
 WETLAND AND MARSHLAND RESOURCES
 Since 1859, filling and construction along San Francisco
 Bay have destroyed over 75 percent of the original 300
 square miles of marshlands bordering the Bay. As a
 result, remaining Bay wetlands are highly valued. Most
 marine life in the Bay either depends upon the marshes
 and mudflats either directly for sustenance or indirectly
 by feeding upon other marine life. Corte Madera
 contains some of these valued wetlands.
 The majority of wetland habitat identified in the Town of Corte Madera occurs east of
 Highway 101, adjacent to San Francisco Bay. Wetland habitats in the Town include open
 waters such as the San Francisco Bay, San Clemente Creek, Corte Madera Channel, and
 various creeks and seasonal streams. Mudflats, tidal marshes and seasonally inundated
 freshwater wetlands are also present.
 The Corte Madera wetlands, including intertidal mudflats, tidal and non-tidal wetlands,
 and adjacent uplands, are an important part of the San Francisco Bay wetlands system,
 providing habitat for many birds, including several rare and endangered species. The
 waters of Corte Madera Bay are particularly important for diving birds such as Scaup,
 Canvasback and Grebe. The San Francisco Bay tidal marshes and areas of undeveloped Bay
 frontage in the Town of Corte Madera take on greater regional significance as a result of the
 continual loss of such habitats to development in the Bay.
 San Francisco Bay is part of the Pacific Flyway, the bi-annual route of migrating waterfowl.
 The marshes and mudflats of the San Francisco Bay in Corte Madera provide important
 feeding and roosting habitat for these migrating birds. In the fall, migrating waterfowl and
 shorebirds arrive from the north to rest and feed before resuming their flights southward to
 Mexico and Central and South America. In the spring, waves of these shorebirds return to
 the north. In addition, freshwater runoff in local streams creates a mix of freshwater and
 saline water that supports invertebrates and fish. The gradient between freshwater and
 saline Bay waters provides specialized niches for fish during specific life stages. The tidal
 marsh habitat and adjacent upland habitats support specialized plant communities,

Tidal marsh habitats are those areas inundated with twice-daily tidal flows. Vegetation in
tidal areas includes pickleweed (Salicornia sp.) and cord grass (Spartina sp.). An important
component of tidal marsh habitat includes uplands associated with manmade levees,
providing refuge for birds and mammals during high tide and storm events. Vegetation on
the levees includes marsh gumplant (Grindelia sp.), sweet fennel (foeniculum vulgare), and
a number of non-native plants. Tidal marsh habitats support a variety of birds and
mammals including several special status species. Northern harriers and other birds of prey
forage in tidal marshes. Song sparrows, clapper rails and other bird species nest in tidal
marshes. Small mammals such as the salt marsh harvest mouse also live in tidal marshes.
Black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) and garter snakes (Thamnopis sp.) live in the
adjacent levee vegetation; and the (non-native) Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) is
anticipated to occur in the tidal marshes.
Brackish marshes are those areas in which tidal waters and fresh waters mix. Brackish
marshes support alkali bulrushes (Scirpus robustus), cattails (Typha sp.), and alkali heath
(Frankenia salina), depending on the ratio of fresh water to tidal waters. Birds such as the
mallard (Anas platryhyncos), pintail (Anas acuta), and great blue heron (Ardea herodias)
forage and roost in brackish marshes.
Mudflats are specialized wetlands that support thousands of shorebirds. Mudflats are
intertidal habitats that are exposed at low tide, allowing shorebirds to prey on invertebrates
and arthropods present in the mud. Mudflats are inundated during high tides, when they
support diving birds and fish.
The following sites are shown in Figure 6.1 (Parks and Recreation) in Chapter 6.
Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve
The California Department of Fish and Game’s ecological reserve is the largest contiguous
piece of wetland habitat in Corte Madera. It covers approximately 200 acres of tidal salt
marsh and mudflats between San Clemente Creek and the Greenbrae Boardwalk. The
reserve is bordered to the west by the existing railroad levee that runs parallel to Highway
101. Ecological reserves are the most protective designations in the State’s habitat protection
system. They are established to provide protection for rare, threatened, or endangered
native plants, wildlife, aquatic organisms and specialized terrestrial or aquatic habitat types.
The Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve supports a number of special status species
including the following:
Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse. The reserve is considered to be critical habitat for the salt mash
harvest mouse, a State and federally listed endangered species. This species is found in tidal
mash habitats, particularly within the transition zone between salt mash and levees that
provide refuge for these small mammals during high tide or storm events.

 California Clapper Rail. California clapper rails are state and federally listed as endangered
 species. Tidal marshes, such as the Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve, support habitat
 for this species.
 California Black Rail. This species is known to use the reserve, especially during the winter
 season. The black rail is listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act.
 Harbor Seal. Although not listed under either the state or federal endangered Species Act,
 the harbor seal is protected under the Marine Mammal protection Act. Corte Madera State
 Ecological Reserve is one of 12 documented harbor seal haul-out locations in the San
 Francisco Bay.
 The reserve can best be viewed from the Department of Fish and Game (DFG) parking lot
 adjacent to the Madera Bay Park site. The reserve is under the ownership and management
 of the DFG.
 Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District Site
 The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District (GGBHTD) previously
 owned much of the Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve described above. When
 mitigation was required for the GGBHTD’s dredging and filling activities associated with
 operations of the Larkspur Ferry, the Ecological Reserve was created and deeded to the
 DFG. However, in the 1970’s GGBHTD used a 72-acre parcel within the Reserve for the
 deposition of dredge materials. The GGBHTD is proposing to restore 3.5 acres of new tidal
 wetlands and 1.9 acres of new seasonal wetlands on the 72-acre site to mitigate potential
 erosion impact from ferry operations.
 Shorebird Marsh
 Shorebird Marsh is owned by the Town of Corte Madera. Located just north of The Village
 shopping center, this marsh can best be seen from the existing gravel parking lot north of
 The Village shopping center and east of Highway 101.
 Triangle Marsh
 Triangle Marsh, a 31-acre parcel located west of Paradise Drive, was purchased by the
 Marin Audubon Society in 2000. The triangular-shaped parcel supports tidal mudflats and
 tidal marsh habitats, and has undergone restoration. The Triangle Marsh Restoration Plan,
 approved by the Town, restores approximately 1.4 acres of tidal marsh and 0.4 acre of
 wetland-upland transitional lands to increase the extent of habitat for marsh-dependent
 species. The Plan also improves public access to provide passive wildlife viewing while
 maintaining a buffer from the restored tidal marsh.
General Plan                                                                         Corte Madera

Freshwater Wetlands
In addition to the wetland sites identified above, areas that would meet the legal definition
of wetlands occur adjacent to flood control channels and other places where freshwater runs
off from the urban areas. A number of potential wetland sites occur west of Highway 101,
including along shoreline locations at the Town’s various lagoons. It is likely that a number
of small wetlands occur in isolated locations without hydrologic connections to subsurface
flows.
Freshwater wetlands may support a large variety of riparian plants. These wetlands occur
adjacent to open water habitats, along streams and storm water or flood control channels, or
in low-lying areas that are seasonally inundated. Numerous birds use freshwater wetlands,
which are a valuable resource for other wildlife as well.
Lagoons
Lagoons 1 and 2 in the Madera Gardens neighborhood are floodwater impoundments that
are connected to Corte Madera Creek. The lagoons are allowed to flood with creek water in
the dry season to maintain habitat values, especially for diving birds.
OPEN SPACE
Preservation and protection of open space and the natural environment have been a priority
in Corte Madera for many years. Maintaining the natural terrain and vegetation of the
community preserves the natural and scenic value of open space and wildlife habitat.
Hillsides and Ridgelines
Corte Madera’s western regions consist of steeply sloping, heavily wooded hills and ravines
that reach elevations of nearly 1,000 feet above sea level. These ridgelands physically and
visually separate the Town from adjoining jurisdictions. Two primary ridges frame the
Town: the Corte Madera Ridge and the Tiburon Peninsula Ridge. The Corte Madera Ridge
runs from northwest to southeast and encompasses smaller ridges locally known as
Meadowsweet Ridge, Chapman Hill, and Christmas Tree Hill. The Tiburon Peninsula Ridge
lies adjacent to the southern end of Town, culminating in the Ring Mountain Open Space
Preserve.
Large areas of the ridges are protected open space, either
under the jurisdiction of the Marin County Open Space
District, or privately owned. There are also upslope
residential neighborhoods in the hilly portions of Town
west of Highway 101, south of Tamalpais Drive on
Chapman Hill and west of Corte Madera Avenue in the
Christmas Tree Hill area.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 The western portions of Town support oak-bay woodland and annual grasslands, coastal
 scrub and coast redwood. Southern ridges support extensive grassland areas. Terrestrial
 habitats occur along the ridgelines and slopes and in the canyons. Oak-bay woodland is the
 dominant terrestrial habitat type and includes live oak (Quercus agrifolia) and the
 California bay (Umbellularia Californica). The Pacific Madrone and coast redwood also
 occur in the terrestrial habitats within Town boundaries
 Many of the ridges support grasslands such as rattlesnake grass (Briza sp.), wild barley
 (Hordeum sp.) and rip-gut brome (Bromus tectorum). Abundant grasslands are found in the
 Ring Mountain Preserve, 72 acres of which occur within the Town of Corte Madera. Coastal
 scrub habitat also occurs along ridges and hillsides and includes shrub species such as
 Coyote brush (Baccharis pilularis), bush monkey flower (Mimulus aurantiacus) and Toyon
 (Heteromeles arbutifolia). The scrub habitat is distributed in dense concentrations along
 ridges, hillsides and other dry areas. This habitat type is often colonized by non-native
 species such as French broom (Cytisus monspessulanus) and Pampas grass (Cortaderia
 selloana).
 SCENIC RESOURCES
 Corte Madera is bordered on three sides by open space areas that weave into the Town as
 ridges, creeks, and wetlands. Town character is a blend of contrasts, from rolling hillsides to
 open waterways and marshlands of the adjoining San Francisco Bay. A significant portion
 of Corte Madera is in the floodplain. The Town is within hiking, biking and driving
 distance of some of the most beautiful vistas in the western United States.
 Scenic resources are among the Town’s important community assets. Scenic viewsheds
 include the open ridge tops of Mount Tamalpais and the bayside wetlands of the San
 Francisco Bay that surround and encompass the Town. View preservation has long been an
 important goal of the community. The balance between development and potential view
 impacts is discussed further in Chapter 5, Community Design. The Town’s natural scenic
 beauty provides residents and visitors with a direct experience of the dramatic landforms
 that define the community’s character.

 3.13        WATER QUALITY
 Water is an essential element of all life forms. Plants and animals are mostly composed of
 water and require water and the nutrients carried by water. An adequate and high quality
 water supply is necessary for continued human survival, development and use of the land,
 and for the health of the entire natural environment. Due to its critical importance, water is
 legally considered a public resource and consequently the use and quality of water have
 long been regulated by government. An adequate and high-quality water supply is
 considered a basic human right. As water typically moves across jurisdictional boundaries,
 associated regulation is at the local, regional, state and federal levels. Local jurisdictions
 have legal authority over development and land use, and are therefore required to consider
 the adequacy of water supplies and how development affects the quantity and quality of
 water available for other beneficial uses.
 As development has continued, the long-term adequacy of groundwater and surface water
 resources has become a major public concern. Water-related issues include lowered
 groundwater levels, increased storm water runoff, sediment and pollutants in runoff, water
 diversions into and out of watersheds, summer rationing in dry years, the water needs of
 fish and wildlife, the rates of water usage, conservation methods, water storage limitations,
 re-use of water and continuing changes in state and federal regulations.
 Trees and other natural vegetation are dependent on water. Their presence also supports
 the long-term quality and quantity of water resources in several ways. The natural
 vegetation found in the vicinity of riparian areas benefits water quality by filtering out
 sediment and pollutants from runoff before it enters surface water bodies. Vegetation can
 also increase the retention of storm water, thereby recharging groundwater, absorbing
 pollutants, slowing and diminishing flood peak levels. Vegetation on stream banks reduces
 bank erosion as a source of sediment. Trees and shrubs provide shade which lowers the
 temperature of the water and thus increases its value as fishery habitat. Trees provide
 shade which cools the ground surface and reduces evaporation. Plants add moisture to the
 air through transpiration of water from their leaves.
 WATER SUPPLY
 The Town of Corte Madera obtains its water supply from the Marin Municipal Water
 District (MMWD), which serves central and southern Marin County. The MMWD provides
 the majority of water from reservoirs on Mt. Tamalpais and west Marin County that are
 typically filled by rainfall each year. Several watersheds on Mt. Tamalpais drain into
 Lagunitas Creek and its tributaries, which in turn flow into a series of reservoirs. The
 District protects 21,250 acres of watershed lands and operates seven reservoirs.
 The MMWD began importing water from the Russian River in the mid-1970s to supplement
 water supply. In 1992, a bond measure was approved to incrementally increase the quantity
 of water from the Russian River to improve the reliability of this water source. Marin
 County planning projections indicate that the MMWD water sources, combined with
 Russian River water, will provide a sufficient water supply well into the 21st century.

WATER QUALITY PROTECTION
Local, regional and state agencies share a common mission to preserve, enhance and restore
the quality of California's water resources, and ensure their proper allocation and efficient
use for the benefit of present and future generations.
The task of protecting and enforcing the many uses of water, including the needs of
residents, industry, agriculture, municipal districts, and the environment is an ongoing
challenge for everyone.
Regional Water Quality Control Board
The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) was created by the Legislature in 1967.
The dual authority over water allocation and water quality protection enables the SWRCB to
provide comprehensive protection for California's waters.
There are nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCBs) within the State of
California. The mission of the RWQCBs is to develop and enforce water quality objectives
and implementation plans that will best protect the beneficial uses of the State's waters,
recognizing local differences in climate, topography, geology, and hydrology.
Each RWQCB has nine part-time members appointed by the Governor and confirmed by
the Senate. Regional Boards develop "basin plans" for their hydrologic areas, issue waste
discharge requirements, take enforcement action against violators, and monitor water
quality.
MCSTOPPP
MCSTOPPP is an acronym for the Marin County Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Program. Formed in 1993, MCSTOPPP is a joint effort of Marin's cities, towns and
unincorporated areas. Their goal is to:
    ♦ prevent stormwater pollution
    ♦ protect and enhance water quality in creeks and wetlands
    ♦ preserve beneficial uses of local waterways
    ♦ comply with State and Federal regulations
Though the County and each of the eleven cities and towns carry out their own individual
stormwater pollution prevention programs, MCSTOPPP provides for coordination and
consistency of approaches between the individual participants and documents their efforts
in annual reports. These reports include information on illegal discharges, street cleaning
efforts, creek maintenance, new development, and other issues of concern.

3.15        AIR QUALITY
AIR QUALITY CLIMATOLOGY
Corte Madera is located in eastern Marin County, which is part of the nine-county San
Francisco Bay Air Basin. Marin County is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the
east by San Pablo Bay and San Francisco Bay, on the south by the Golden Gate and on the
north by the Petaluma Gap. Corte Madera is partially sheltered from prevailing
northwesterly winds off the Pacific Ocean by elevated terrain. Temperatures in Corte
Madera are moderated by the cooling effect of the San Francisco Bay in summer and the
warming effect of the Bay in winter.
As a result of these climatological and topographic conditions, eastern Marin County (the
greater Corte Madera area) has a greater potential for air quality problems compared to the
rest of the County. Air pollution potential is a function of climate alone and not indicative of
actual air pollution levels. High air pollution potential means that the sheltering terrain and
relatively light winds often limit the atmosphere's ability to transport and dilute pollutants.
Marin County does not have many polluting industries and is located on the up-wind edge
of the air basin, so current air quality is good despite a high climatological pollution
potential.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND AIR QUALITY PROGRAMS
Efforts to combat air pollution began in the Bay Area in

ozone, and a State non-attainment area for carbon
monoxide, ozone and PM10. The entire Bay Area is
currently designated as a federal and State attainment
area for carbon monoxide, but remains an ozone non-attainment area.
AIR POLLUTANTS OF CONCERN IN THE BAY AREA AND CORTE MADERA
The federal ambient air quality standards are met in Marin County, but the more stringent
State standards for ozone and PM10 are exceeded. The following is a description of problem
pollutants in Corte Madera and the greater Bay Area.
Ozone
Ground level ozone, often referred to as smog, is not emitted directly, but is formed in the
atmosphere through complex chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and
reactive organic gases (ROG) in the presence of sunlight. The principal sources of NOx and
Corte Madera                                                                          General Plan
April 2009
                                               3-49
3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 ROG, often termed ozone precursors, are combustion processes (including automobiles) and
 evaporation of solvents, paints and fuels. Motor vehicles are the single largest source of
 ozone precursors emissions in the Bay Area. Exposure to ozone can cause eye irritation,
 aggravate respiratory diseases and damage lung tissue, as well as damage vegetation and
 reduce visibility.
 Carbon Monoxide
 Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that is formed by the incomplete
 combustion of fuels. Motor vehicles are by far the single largest source of CO in the Bay
 Area. In Corte Madera, vehicles traveling along Highway 101 contribute carbon monoxide
 to the local air quality conditions. At high concentrations, CO reduces the oxygen carrying
 capacity of blood and can cause headaches, dizziness, unconsciousness, and even death. CO
 is currently a minor concern in the Bay Area. While violations of the ambient air quality
 standards were recorded in all years prior to 1991, concentrations of this pollutant have
 been steadily declining, and the region has been designated an attainment area for both the
 state and federal ambient air quality standards.
 Particulate Matter
 Suspended particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of tiny particles that consists of dry
 solid fragments, solid cores with liquid coatings, and small droplets of liquid. These
 particles vary greatly in shape, size, and chemical composition and can be made up of many
 different materials such as metals, soot, soil, and dust. “Inhalable” PM consists of particles
 less than 10 microns in diameter, and is defined as “suspended particulate matter” or PM10.
 Fine particles are less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5). PM2.5, by definition, is included
 in PM10.
 Particulate matter (PM) includes a wide range of solid or liquid particles, including smoke,
 dust, aerosols and metallic oxides. There are many sources of PM emissions, including
 combustion, industrial processes, grading and construction, and motor vehicles. Of the PM
 emissions associated with motor vehicle use, some are tailpipe and tire wear emissions, but
 greater quantities are generated by re-suspended road dust. Consequently, improvements in
 motor vehicle engines and fuels have not reduced PM emissions as significantly as they
 have reduced emissions of other pollutants. Reductions in motor vehicle use are needed to
 significantly reduce PM emissions from re-suspended road dust.
 Particulate matter is a concern because it can bypass the body's natural filtration system
 more easily than larger particles, and can lodge deep in the lungs. Health effects of PM vary
 depending on a number of factors, including the type and size of the particle. Research has
 shown a correlation between high PM10, concentrations and increased mortality rates.
 Elevated levels can also aggravate chronic respiratory illness such as bronchitis and asthma.

Wood Smoke
Wood burning in fireplaces and stoves is a significant source of PM, particularly during
episodes when PM10 levels are highest. Wood smoke has long been identified as a
significant source of pollutants in urban and suburban areas as it contributes to particulate
matter and carbon monoxide concentrations, reduces visibility and contains numerous
Toxic Air Contaminants. Present controls on this source include the adoption of emission
standards for wood stoves and fireplace inserts. Interest in wood smoke regulation is likely
to increase in communities that experience substantial use of wood burning as a heating
source.
Toxic Air Contaminants
In addition to the criteria pollutants discussed above, toxic air contaminants (TACs) are
another group of pollutants of concern in the Bay Area. Unlike criteria pollutants, no safe
levels of exposure to TACs can be established. There are many different types of TACs, with
varying degrees of toxicity. Sources of TACs include industrial processes such as petroleum
refining and chrome plating operations, commercial operations such as gasoline stations
and dry cleaners, and motor vehicle exhaust. Public exposure to TACs can result from
emissions due to normal operations, as well as accidental releases of hazardous materials
during upset conditions. The health effects of TACs include cancer, birth defects,
neurological damage and death.
Diesel Exhaust
In 1988, the California Air Resources Board identified diesel engine particulate matter as a
toxic air contaminant and human carcinogen. The exhaust from diesel engines contains
hundreds of different gaseous and particulate components, many of which are toxic and
capable of penetrating deep into the lungs. Diesel exhaust is the most dangerous and
ubiquitous TAC in the Bay Area, with high concentrations near heavily traveled highways
and intersections.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The increasing amount of GHG emissions and criteria air pollutants stemming primarily
from the burning of fossil fuels is negatively impacting air quality in the atmosphere as well
as contributing to global climate change. GHGs include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
oxide, and sulfur hexafluoride, among others. Warmer temperatures associated with
climate change lead to conditions that are conducive to air pollution formation, including
higher ozone levels, causing increased asthma and respiratory illness.
Other Air Quality Issues
Other air quality issues of concern in the Bay Area include nuisance impacts of odors and
dust. The BAAQMD has enacted an odorous substances control program as part of its effort

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 to control the use and emission of odorous substances and nuisance dust within the Bay
 Area.
 Sensitive Receptors and Pollution Sources
 The BAAQMD defines sensitive receptors as facilities where sensitive receptor population
 groups (children, the elderly, the acutely ill and the chronically ill) are likely to be located.
 These land uses include schools, retirement homes, convalescent homes, hospitals and
 medical clinics. Such sensitive receptors are spread through most parts of Corte Madera.
 The BAAQMD inventory lists no major emitting facilities for criteria pollutants in Corte
 Madera. The current inventory does, however, identify numerous dry cleaners as sources of
 TACs spread over the commercial areas of Corte Madera. None of the sources of TACs in
 Corte Madera are considered as facilities with health risks requiring public notification
 under the Air Toxics Hot Spots Program.
 Relevance to General Plan
 There are currently no federal, state or local air quality related constraints on cities in the
 Bay Area. The BAAQMD has developed guidelines and thresholds of significance for local
 plans that affect CEQA documentation for the Corte Madera General Plan. Inconsistency
 with the most recently adopted Clean Air Plan (CAP) is considered a significant impact.
 According to the BAAQMD, the following criteria must be satisfied for a local plan to be
 determined consistent with the CAP and not have a significant air quality impact:
     ♦ The local plan should be consistent with the CAP population and Vehicle Miles
         Traveled (VMT) assumptions. This is demonstrated if the population growth over
         the planning period will not exceed the values included in the current CAP, and
     ♦ The local plan demonstrates reasonable efforts to implement the Transportation
         Control Measures (TCMs) included in the CAP that identify cities as implementing
         agencies.
 Of particular importance is mitigation of air quality impacts from projects that might result
 in sensitive receptors’ exposure to high levels of diesel exhaust. The design, layout and
 orientation of high-density housing, for example, will need to minimize exposure of
 residents to diesel exhaust. The BAAQMD (together with five other regional agencies)
 encourages compact, infill development near public transit. High density development with
 a transit orientation is considered "smart growth" as a means of combating the increasing
 use of automobiles in the region.

 3.17        CULTURAL AND HISTORIC RESOURCES
 Numerous prehistoric archaeological sites have been identified near former or existing
 marsh boundaries, watercourses, the base of foothills, and near vegetation throughout the
 Bay Area, including Corte Madera. The California Archaeological Inventory has identified
 eight recorded prehistoric archaeological sites within the Town of Corte Madera and two
 adjacent archaeological sites within the Ring Mountain Preserve. Areas that have not been
 part of a project environmental review (this includes ninety percent of the Town) have never
 been studied, so there is a high probability of potentially unrecognized prehistoric and
 historic cultural resources within Corte Madera.
 The earliest archaeological sites in the San Francisco Bay region date from approximately
 4,000 to 7,000 years ago, when populations occupied areas near bayshore and marsh
 habitats. Archaeological sites dating between 1,500 to 1,700 years ago display an increasing
 complexity in artifact style. The Coast Miwok occupied the area now known as Corte
 Madera. Local prehistoric site findings include shell midden, petroglyphs, bedrock mortar,
 and other evidence of occupation. Indigenous populations within Corte Madera, disrupted
 by the Spanish Mission System, would most likely have been incorporated into the missions
 established in San Rafael, San Francisco, or Sonoma.
 Under State guidelines (State Office of Historic Preservation), any building constructed
 more than 45 years ago could possibly be identified as an historic structure. According to
 the State Office of Historic Preservation’s Historic Property Data File for Marin County,
 several historic properties within Corte Madera are listed in State and Federal inventories.
 Several of these identified historic resources are located within the Old Corte Madera
 Square area, including Holy Innocents Church, Moore’s Hall, and Parkside Hotel.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND
        SUSTAINABILITY

                     CHAPTER 3 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND
                                                                     SUSTAINABILTY
3.1         INTRODUCTION
This chapter includes policies and programs that promote
community sustainability and effective management of
renewable and non-renewable natural resources through
energy conservation, solid waste management and
recycling, natural area resource conservation, and
preservation of cultural and historic resources. It meets the
State’s General Plan requirements for the Conservation and Open Space elements.
As part of the General Plan update process, Corte Madera residents expressed an interest in
moving from the protection-oriented environmental framework of the 1989 General Plan to
a more proactive approach that would advance the principles of community sustainability
through strategies that conserve and enhance local natural resources.
The strategy in this Chapter is based on the understanding that conserving significant
natural resources and biological diversity improves recreational opportunities, sustains
natural systems, reduces negative environmental impacts, and improves overall quality of
life.
Scientific consensus supports the conclusion that humans are impacting global climate by
increasing greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. Climate change is a global problem,
and GHGs impact the global atmosphere; this means that activities that take place in one
part of the world impact the entire atmosphere, unlike criteria pollutants which have an
impact on local air quality. It will take a global effort to reduce GHG emissions to the point
where global climate does not pose a serious threat to our communities. Climate change has
and will continue to impact the environment in a variety of ways, and will also cause
economic and social effects. Potential climate change impacts directly affecting Corte
Madera include the following: sea level rise and increased flooding, water supply issues,
wildfire risk, public health concerns, air quality threats, more intense storm events, and
energy demand and supply. This chapter discusses the climate change issue and includes
policies and programs directed at mitigation. Other chapters in the General Plan address
measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as promoting mixed use and infill
development, transportation alternatives, transit oriented development, and the creation of
Design Guidelines that incorporate resource efficiency.
3.2         REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
The required General Plan provisions for Conservation and Open Space are included in this
chapter, and provide direction for the conservation, preservation, development, and
utilization of natural resources. Government Code Sections 65302(d) and 65302(e) require
that a general plan include:
Corte Madera                                                                       General Plan

                                               3-1

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
         “A conservation element for the conservation, development, and utilization of
         natural resources…”
         “An open space element as provided in Article 10.5”
 Guiding policies include comprehensive and long-range preservation and conservation
 measures with regard to open-space lands (§65563).
 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
 There are numerous local, state and federal agencies and laws that regulate biological
 resources, including:
      ♦ State Department of Fish and Game
      ♦ Bay Conservation and Development Commission
      ♦ U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
 Appendix A to the General Plan lists various agencies and laws protecting biological
 resources, including information related to endangered and threatened plant and animal
 species. The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is the overriding State Law that
 requires analysis of impacts on biological and natural area resources. More detailed
 discussion about this topic is covered in Section 3.11 Natural Area Resource Conservation.
 WASTE MANAGEMENT RESOURCES
 The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939) required each city and
 county to divert 50 percent of its waste stream from landfill disposal by the year 2000.
 Diversion may include reducing the total amount of waste generated through source
 reduction, recycling, composting, and transformation programs. In 1992, Marin’s eleven
 cities and the County adopted a single Source Reduction and Recycling (SSR) Element that
 determined current diversion rates, evaluated alternative diversion programs, and set forth
 a course of action. More detailed discussions about this topic are covered in Section 3.9
 Solid Waste Management and Recycling.
 HISTORIC RESOURCES
 The Town contains historic structures that are important to community identity. The
 General Plan provides the opportunity to recognize and preserve structures and artifacts
 from the Town’s origin in the late 1800s. Additionally, protection of significant historic
 resources is afforded under provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA),
 which requires planning agencies to carefully consider the potential effects of a project on
 historical resources. More detailed discussion about this topic is covered in Section 3.17
 Cultural and Historic Resources.

CLIMATE CHANGE
Among the evolving regulations that affect local General Plans are State regulations that
specifically address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. At the time of this
General Plan Update, there are no regulations setting ambient air quality emissions
standards for greenhouse gases.
Executive Order S-3-05
Executive Order S-3-05, which was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger in 2005, proclaims
that California is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It declares that increased
temperatures could reduce the Sierra’s snowpack, further exacerbate California’s air quality
problems, and potentially cause a rise in sea levels. To combat those concerns, the Executive
Order established total greenhouse gas emission targets. Specifically, emissions are to be
reduced to the 2000 level by 2010, the 1990 level by 2020, and to 80% below the 1990 level by
2050. To comply with the Executive Order, the Secretary of the CalEPA created a Climate
Action Team (CAT) made up of members from various state agencies and commissions.
CAT released its first report in March 2006. The report proposed to achieve the targets by
building on voluntary actions of California businesses, local government and community
actions, as well as through state incentive and regulatory programs.
Assembly Bill 32, The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006
In September 2006, Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 32, the California Global Warming
Solutions Act of 2006. The State legislature recognizes the importance of the issue of climate
change, as AB 32 states: “Global warming poses a serious threat to the economic well-being,
public health, natural resources, and the environment of California.”
AB 32 requires that statewide GHG emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by the year 2020.
This reduction will be accomplished through an enforceable statewide cap on GHG
emissions that will be phased in starting in 2012. To effectively implement the cap, AB 32
directs ARB to develop and implement regulations to reduce statewide GHG emissions
from stationary sources.
State Attorney General
At the time of this General Plan Update, recent legislation in the form of AB 32 has
prompted the California State Attorney General’s office to send comment letters to local
lead agencies regarding incorporating an analysis of GHG emissions and climate change
mitigation measures in CEQA and long range planning documents. While the Attorney
General has focused some comment letters towards specific development projects, much of
the focus has been on long range planning documents such as General Plans.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 The Attorney General’s office has suggested that by law, a General Plan must discuss
 climate change, and include meaningful, tangible, enforceable, and funded policies,
 implementation mechanisms and timelines.
 3.3         SETTING
 The transition area from the San Francisco Bay tidal wetlands and marshes to the upland
 grassy hillsides and oak woodlands has created many ecological niches in the Corte Madera
 region. Wetlands provide plant and wildlife habitat that aid in water purification by
 assimilating waste, and trapping and neutralizing pollutants from urban runoff. Wetlands
 contribute to groundwater recharge, protect the shoreline from wave action, and enhance
 recreational values as open space and wildlife sanctuaries. Vegetation in estuarine mudflats
 and the adjacent alluvial plains contributes plant materials that form the critical base of
 watery food chains and provides more oxygen per acre than any other natural ecosystem.
 Local marshlands assist flood control by providing a buffer between the Bay and developed
 portions of Corte Madera, and act as retention ponds for storm water overflow.
 A variety of plants and wildlife occur in the Town of Corte Madera. In some cases, plants
 and wildlife are unique to the Corte Madera region and the Mount Tamalpais watershed.
 Species that are unique to the region are considered locally rare and are protected under the
 California Environmental Quality Act or the California Endangered Species Act. The State
 and Federal Endangered Species Acts determine threatened and endangered “special
 status” species. Special-status species include:
     ♦ Officially designated (rare, threatened, or endangered) and species that are
         candidates for listing by the California Department of Fish and Game.

3.4             CLIMATE CHANGE
Scientific consensus supports the conclusion that humans are impacting global climate by
increasing greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change’s (IPCC)1 Fourth Assessment Report includes the latest scientific research
available at the time of this General Plan. The Report states that global atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have significantly increased
since 1750 as a result of human activities. Fossil fuel use and land use changes are the
primary sources of global increases in carbon dioxide concentration; agriculture is the
primary source of increases in methane and nitrous oxide2. The Report concludes that
warming of the climate system is “unequivocal” and scientists agree that there is a 90
percent chance that this warming is the net effect of human activities since 1750.2
California is highly ranked in the world for the amount of GHG emissions emitted in the
state, but has taken the lead in creating stringent GHG emissions reduction policies. 3
Assembly Bill 32 requires the implementation of measures to reduce the state’s GHG
emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 – an expected 25 percent reduction. The main source of
atmospheric carbon dioxide in California is the burning of fossil fuels, comprising 98% of
gross carbon dioxide emissions.4
Quantifying, managing and reducing GHG will help protect the health of the community,
ecosystems, and biodiversity from potentially dangerous climate changes. Reducing GHG
also contributes to the achievement of various municipal goals such as improving air and
water quality and fostering economic development.
3.5             COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY
Sustainability is an evolving concept that is defined in different ways, since it has both
general and specific applications. In its broadest sense, global environmental sustainability
is derived from an understanding that there are finite natural resources on this earth and
that these life sustaining resources must not be consumed faster than they can be naturally
replaced. Equally important, there must not be irreversible harm caused to sensitive
ecological habitats or environmental systems beyond their capacity to sustain human life.
1 The IPCC is a body created by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, and
was created to assess peer reviewed scientific and technical studies and reports in order to present “comprehensive, objective,
open and transparent” information on climate change.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 For the purposes of this General Plan, sustainability can be defined as a balance of the built
 environment, socioeconomic activities, and the natural environment that assures the natural
 resources are managed and protected so they can continue to sustain life.
 As a local community, Corte Madera is limited in how much it can implement this
 overarching concept. The community can, though, focus its efforts on local policies and
 programs that take steps to encourage and advance sustainability principles both locally
 and regionally.
 Corte Madera residents understand that local decisions regarding land use, housing,
 transportation, open space conservation, sensitive habitat preservation, recycling, waste
 management, water conservation and energy conservation have significant cumulative
 impacts on the regional health and quality of life. By taking steps to encourage and advance
 sustainability principles, the overall quality of life will be improved today and for
 generations to come.
 Numerous sustainability ideas and approaches are integrated into all chapters of the
 General Plan, and address a variety of issues such as infill construction and redevelopment,
 provision of infrastructure, transportation modes and parking, and open space and parks.
 A “Sustainable” Corte Madera, under this General Plan, will utilize various strategies to
 conserve and enhance local resources and safeguard the environment as a means of
 improving the livability and quality of life for Town residents.

3.7             ENERGY
Today’s primary pattern of energy use, using non-renewable energy sources, cannot be
sustained over the long run. Greater use of alternative energy sources will likely be part of
our future community and economy. Additionally, fossil fuel consumption generates waste
products that are toxic and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. The
environmental toll and health problems associated with toxic releases and climate change
may incur irreparable damage. Climate change, air pollution from burning fossil fuels, and
the breakdown of living systems due to the buildup of toxins are some of the costliest
problems community members face. Addressing the need to change can begin with a
community’s efforts to improve energy efficiency.
Energy efficiency means using less energy to perform the same function, while energy
conservation connotes “doing without” in order to save energy. Minimizing transportation-
related energy consumption and reducing energy consumption in buildings are examples of
important conservation techniques that Corte Madera can utilize. Factors that influence the
Town’s local energy-related activities include energy reliability, production, consumption,
and conservation. Increased awareness of energy use will help the Town’s efforts at
conserving resources and establishing sustainable policies for energy production and
consumption.
GREEN BUILDING
According to the US Green Building Council at the time this General Plan Update, buildings
in the United States use almost 40 percent of our nation’s total primary energy budget,
produce at least 30 percent of our greenhouse gases, and create nearly 30 percent of our
waste.5 The US Department of Energy has concluded that buildings in the nation currently
use more energy than any other economic sector, including transportation and industry.6
Innovative and affordable efficient building strategies are now available to reduce the
building sector’s impact on the indoor and outdoor environment.
Performance based programs such as the US Green Building Council’s Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification system offer opportunities to
increase a building’s environmental performance and improve occupant health through
efficient (also known as “green”) building strategies. Cities and federal agencies are
increasingly adopting the LEED or other rating systems for their buildings. The State of
California Governor’s Executive Order (S-20-04) calls for all newly constructed or renovated
State buildings over 10,000 square feet to meet LEED Silver criteria, and a Green Building

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 3.9             SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING
 The environmental movement helped to establish the connections between being a “throw-
 away” society, the dangers of landfilling and incineration, and resource-conservation issues.
 Natural resources, non-renewable petroleum reserves, and agricultural topsoil are buried in
 landfills at colossal rates. Independent recycling centers have been opened to remedy this
 trend. Most towns and cities now offer curbside residential recycling programs and many
 businesses have established recycling programs in the workplace.
 The fundamental challenge of achieving sustainable urban waste management is in finding
 solutions to the increased production of disposable products and the use of packaging as a
 marketing tool. Approaches to reducing waste in Corte Madera can include purchasing
 durable, repairable, and reusable products, and purchasing products made from recycled
 materials. These strategies, combined with improved recycling collection and processing
 programs, will help to reduce Corte Madera’s waste stream and conserve resources.
 SOLID WASTE COLLECTION
 Mill Valley Refuse Service provides waste collection service in Corte Madera, and is one of
 seven privately owned waste haulers in Marin County. Redwood Landfill, located in
 Novato, is used for more than 95 percent of Marin County’s waste disposal, including the
 Town of Corte Madera. In July 1995, Redwood Landfill was issued a new Solid Waste
 Facility permit, which extended the landfill site life to the year 2039. The landfill has
 projected capacity to meet service needs for Corte Madera for the next several decades. Both
 Mill Valley Refuse and the Redwood Landfill meet applicable federal, state and local laws
 related to handling and disposal of solid waste.
 RECYCLING
 The monitoring and evaluation program described in the Multi-Jurisdictional Source
 Reduction and Recycling Element for Marin County, which also applies to the cities in the
 County, achieved compliance with requirements of AB 939. AB 939 mandated that
 communities divert at least 50 percent of their waste streams by the year 2000; Corte Madera
 diverted 56 percent of its waste stream by the year 2000, while Marin County as a whole
 diverted 63 percent.
 Marin Recycling and Resource Recovery Association (MRRRA) operates the Marin
 Recycling Center where much of the material collected by curbside recycling in Corte
 Madera is processed. MRRRA operates a curbside recycling program for all residences in
 Corte Madera. Service includes weekly curbside collection of newspaper, cardboard,
 container glass, ferrous, aluminum and plastic. Other recycling activities in Corte Madera
 include aluminum and glass buyback centers, paper and cardboard recycling from
 commercial operations, and residential and commercial wood recycling. The Town’s Public
 Works Department composts a portion of landscape wastes from public parks.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 3.11        NATURAL AREA RESOURCE CONSERVATION
 The environmental setting for the Town of Corte Madera can be divided into the following
 categories:
     ♦ Wetlands, including tidal wetlands and waters and freshwater wetlands and drainages
     ♦ Open Space, which includes hillsides and ridgelines
     ♦ Scenic Resources
 WETLAND AND MARSHLAND RESOURCES
 Since 1859, filling and construction along San Francisco
 Bay have destroyed over 75 percent of the original 300
 square miles of marshlands bordering the Bay. As a
 result, remaining Bay wetlands are highly valued. Most
 marine life in the Bay either depends upon the marshes
 and mudflats either directly for sustenance or indirectly
 by feeding upon other marine life. Corte Madera
 contains some of these valued wetlands.
 The majority of wetland habitat identified in the Town of Corte Madera occurs east of
 Highway 101, adjacent to San Francisco Bay. Wetland habitats in the Town include open
 waters such as the San Francisco Bay, San Clemente Creek, Corte Madera Channel, and
 various creeks and seasonal streams. Mudflats, tidal marshes and seasonally inundated
 freshwater wetlands are also present.
 The Corte Madera wetlands, including intertidal mudflats, tidal and non-tidal wetlands,
 and adjacent uplands, are an important part of the San Francisco Bay wetlands system,
 providing habitat for many birds, including several rare and endangered species. The
 waters of Corte Madera Bay are particularly important for diving birds such as Scaup,
 Canvasback and Grebe. The San Francisco Bay tidal marshes and areas of undeveloped Bay
 frontage in the Town of Corte Madera take on greater regional significance as a result of the
 continual loss of such habitats to development in the Bay.
 San Francisco Bay is part of the Pacific Flyway, the bi-annual route of migrating waterfowl.
 The marshes and mudflats of the San Francisco Bay in Corte Madera provide important
 feeding and roosting habitat for these migrating birds. In the fall, migrating waterfowl and
 shorebirds arrive from the north to rest and feed before resuming their flights southward to
 Mexico and Central and South America. In the spring, waves of these shorebirds return to
 the north. In addition, freshwater runoff in local streams creates a mix of freshwater and
 saline water that supports invertebrates and fish. The gradient between freshwater and
 saline Bay waters provides specialized niches for fish during specific life stages. The tidal
 marsh habitat and adjacent upland habitats support specialized plant communities,
 including several unique species that occur only in a few places throughout the state.

Tidal marsh habitats are those areas inundated with twice-daily tidal flows. Vegetation in
tidal areas includes pickleweed (Salicornia sp.) and cord grass (Spartina sp.). An important
component of tidal marsh habitat includes uplands associated with manmade levees,
providing refuge for birds and mammals during high tide and storm events. Vegetation on
the levees includes marsh gumplant (Grindelia sp.), sweet fennel (foeniculum vulgare), and
a number of non-native plants. Tidal marsh habitats support a variety of birds and
mammals including several special status species. Northern harriers and other birds of prey
forage in tidal marshes. Song sparrows, clapper rails and other bird species nest in tidal
marshes. Small mammals such as the salt marsh harvest mouse also live in tidal marshes.
Black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) and garter snakes (Thamnopis sp.) live in the
adjacent levee vegetation; and the (non-native) Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) is
anticipated to occur in the tidal marshes.
Brackish marshes are those areas in which tidal waters and fresh waters mix. Brackish
marshes support alkali bulrushes (Scirpus robustus), cattails (Typha sp.), and alkali heath
(Frankenia salina), depending on the ratio of fresh water to tidal waters. Birds such as the
mallard (Anas platryhyncos), pintail (Anas acuta), and great blue heron (Ardea herodias)
forage and roost in brackish marshes.
Mudflats are specialized wetlands that support thousands of shorebirds. Mudflats are
intertidal habitats that are exposed at low tide, allowing shorebirds to prey on invertebrates
and arthropods present in the mud. Mudflats are inundated during high tides, when they
support diving birds and fish.
The following sites are shown in Figure 6.1 (Parks and Recreation) in Chapter 6.
Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve
The California Department of Fish and Game’s ecological reserve is the largest contiguous
piece of wetland habitat in Corte Madera. It covers approximately 200 acres of tidal salt
marsh and mudflats between San Clemente Creek and the Greenbrae Boardwalk. The
reserve is bordered to the west by the existing railroad levee that runs parallel to Highway
101. Ecological reserves are the most protective designations in the State’s habitat protection
system. They are established to provide protection for rare, threatened, or endangered
native plants, wildlife, aquatic organisms and specialized terrestrial or aquatic habitat types.
The Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve supports a number of special status species
including the following:
Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse. The reserve is considered to be critical habitat for the salt mash
harvest mouse, a State and federally listed endangered species. This species is found in tidal
mash habitats, particularly within the transition zone between salt mash and levees that
provide refuge for these small mammals during high tide or storm events.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 California Clapper Rail. California clapper rails are state and federally listed as endangered
 species. Tidal marshes, such as the Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve, support habitat
 for this species.
 California Black Rail. This species is known to use the reserve, especially during the winter
 season. The black rail is listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act.
 Harbor Seal. Although not listed under either the state or federal endangered Species Act,
 the harbor seal is protected under the Marine Mammal protection Act. Corte Madera State
 Ecological Reserve is one of 12 documented harbor seal haul-out locations in the San
 Francisco Bay.
 The reserve can best be viewed from the Department of Fish and Game (DFG) parking lot
 adjacent to the Madera Bay Park site. The reserve is under the ownership and management
 of the DFG.
 Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District Site
 The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District (GGBHTD) previously
 owned much of the Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve described above. When
 mitigation was required for the GGBHTD’s dredging and filling activities associated with
 operations of the Larkspur Ferry, the Ecological Reserve was created and deeded to the
 DFG. However, in the 1970’s GGBHTD used a 72-acre parcel within the Reserve for the
 deposition of dredge materials. The GGBHTD is proposing to restore 3.5 acres of new tidal
 wetlands and 1.9 acres of new seasonal wetlands on the 72-acre site to mitigate potential
 erosion impact from ferry operations.
 Shorebird Marsh
 Shorebird Marsh is owned by the Town of Corte Madera. Located just north of The Village
 shopping center, this marsh can best be seen from the existing gravel parking lot north of
 The Village shopping center and east of Highway 101.
 Triangle Marsh
 Triangle Marsh, a 31-acre parcel located west of Paradise Drive, was purchased by the
 Marin Audubon Society in 2000. The triangular-shaped parcel supports tidal mudflats and
 tidal marsh habitats, and has undergone restoration. The Triangle Marsh Restoration Plan,
 approved by the Town, restores approximately 1.4 acres of tidal marsh and 0.4 acre of
 wetland-upland transitional lands to increase the extent of habitat for marsh-dependent
 species. The Plan also improves public access to provide passive wildlife viewing while
 maintaining a buffer from the restored tidal marsh.

Freshwater Wetlands
In addition to the wetland sites identified above, areas that would meet the legal definition
of wetlands occur adjacent to flood control channels and other places where freshwater runs
off from the urban areas. A number of potential wetland sites occur west of Highway 101,
including along shoreline locations at the Town’s various lagoons. It is likely that a number
of small wetlands occur in isolated locations without hydrologic connections to subsurface
flows.
Freshwater wetlands may support a large variety of riparian plants. These wetlands occur
adjacent to open water habitats, along streams and storm water or flood control channels, or
in low-lying areas that are seasonally inundated. Numerous birds use freshwater wetlands,
which are a valuable resource for other wildlife as well.
Lagoons
Lagoons 1 and 2 in the Madera Gardens neighborhood are floodwater impoundments that
are connected to Corte Madera Creek. The lagoons are allowed to flood with creek water in
the dry season to maintain habitat values, especially for diving birds.
OPEN SPACE
Preservation and protection of open space and the natural environment have been a priority
in Corte Madera for many years. Maintaining the natural terrain and vegetation of the
community preserves the natural and scenic value of open space and wildlife habitat.
Hillsides and Ridgelines
Corte Madera’s western regions consist of steeply sloping, heavily wooded hills and ravines
that reach elevations of nearly 1,000 feet above sea level. These ridgelands physically and
visually separate the Town from adjoining jurisdictions. Two primary ridges frame the
Town: the Corte Madera Ridge and the Tiburon Peninsula Ridge. The Corte Madera Ridge
runs from northwest to southeast and encompasses smaller ridges locally known as
Meadowsweet Ridge, Chapman Hill, and Christmas Tree Hill. The Tiburon Peninsula Ridge
lies adjacent to the southern end of Town, culminating in the Ring Mountain Open Space
Preserve.
Large areas of the ridges are protected open space, either
under the jurisdiction of the Marin County Open Space
District, or privately owned. There are also upslope
residential neighborhoods in the hilly portions of Town
west of Highway 101, south of Tamalpais Drive on
Chapman Hill and west of Corte Madera Avenue in the
Christmas Tree Hill area.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 The western portions of Town support oak-bay woodland and annual grasslands, coastal
 scrub and coast redwood. Southern ridges support extensive grassland areas. Terrestrial
 habitats occur along the ridgelines and slopes and in the canyons. Oak-bay woodland is the
 dominant terrestrial habitat type and includes live oak (Quercus agrifolia) and the
 California bay (Umbellularia Californica). The Pacific Madrone and coast redwood also
 occur in the terrestrial habitats within Town boundaries
 Many of the ridges support grasslands such as rattlesnake grass (Briza sp.), wild barley
 (Hordeum sp.) and rip-gut brome (Bromus tectorum). Abundant grasslands are found in the
 Ring Mountain Preserve, 72 acres of which occur within the Town of Corte Madera. Coastal
 scrub habitat also occurs along ridges and hillsides and includes shrub species such as
 Coyote brush (Baccharis pilularis), bush monkey flower (Mimulus aurantiacus) and Toyon
 (Heteromeles arbutifolia). The scrub habitat is distributed in dense concentrations along
 ridges, hillsides and other dry areas. This habitat type is often colonized by non-native
 species such as French broom (Cytisus monspessulanus) and Pampas grass (Cortaderia
 selloana).
 SCENIC RESOURCES
 Corte Madera is bordered on three sides by open space areas that weave into the Town as
 ridges, creeks, and wetlands. Town character is a blend of contrasts, from rolling hillsides to
 open waterways and marshlands of the adjoining San Francisco Bay. A significant portion
 of Corte Madera is in the floodplain. The Town is within hiking, biking and driving
 distance of some of the most beautiful vistas in the western United States.
 Scenic resources are among the Town’s important community assets. Scenic viewsheds
 include the open ridge tops of Mount Tamalpais and the bayside wetlands of the San
 Francisco Bay that surround and encompass the Town. View preservation has long been an
 important goal of the community. The balance between development and potential view
 impacts is discussed further in Chapter 5, Community Design. The Town’s natural scenic
 beauty provides residents and visitors with a direct experience of the dramatic landforms
 that define the community’s character.

 3.13        WATER QUALITY
 Water is an essential element of all life forms. Plants and animals are mostly composed of
 water and require water and the nutrients carried by water. An adequate and high quality
 water supply is necessary for continued human survival, development and use of the land,
 and for the health of the entire natural environment. Due to its critical importance, water is
 legally considered a public resource and consequently the use and quality of water have
 long been regulated by government. An adequate and high-quality water supply is
 considered a basic human right. As water typically moves across jurisdictional boundaries,
 associated regulation is at the local, regional, state and federal levels. Local jurisdictions
 have legal authority over development and land use, and are therefore required to consider
 the adequacy of water supplies and how development affects the quantity and quality of
 water available for other beneficial uses.
 As development has continued, the long-term adequacy of groundwater and surface water
 resources has become a major public concern. Water-related issues include lowered
 groundwater levels, increased storm water runoff, sediment and pollutants in runoff, water
 diversions into and out of watersheds, summer rationing in dry years, the water needs of
 fish and wildlife, the rates of water usage, conservation methods, water storage limitations,
 re-use of water and continuing changes in state and federal regulations.
 Trees and other natural vegetation are dependent on water. Their presence also supports
 the long-term quality and quantity of water resources in several ways. The natural
 vegetation found in the vicinity of riparian areas benefits water quality by filtering out
 sediment and pollutants from runoff before it enters surface water bodies. Vegetation can
 also increase the retention of storm water, thereby recharging groundwater, absorbing
 pollutants, slowing and diminishing flood peak levels. Vegetation on stream banks reduces
 bank erosion as a source of sediment. Trees and shrubs provide shade which lowers the
 temperature of the water and thus increases its value as fishery habitat. Trees provide
 shade which cools the ground surface and reduces evaporation. Plants add moisture to the
 air through transpiration of water from their leaves.
 WATER SUPPLY
 The Town of Corte Madera obtains its water supply from the Marin Municipal Water
 District (MMWD), which serves central and southern Marin County. The MMWD provides
 the majority of water from reservoirs on Mt. Tamalpais and west Marin County that are
 typically filled by rainfall each year. Several watersheds on Mt. Tamalpais drain into
 Lagunitas Creek and its tributaries, which in turn flow into a series of reservoirs. The
 District protects 21,250 acres of watershed lands and operates seven reservoirs.
 The MMWD began importing water from the Russian River in the mid-1970s to supplement
 water supply. In 1992, a bond measure was approved to incrementally increase the quantity
 of water from the Russian River to improve the reliability of this water source. Marin
 County planning projections indicate that the MMWD water sources, combined with
 Russian River water, will provide a sufficient water supply well into the 21st century.

WATER QUALITY PROTECTION
Local, regional and state agencies share a common mission to preserve, enhance and restore
the quality of California's water resources, and ensure their proper allocation and efficient
use for the benefit of present and future generations.
The task of protecting and enforcing the many uses of water, including the needs of
residents, industry, agriculture, municipal districts, and the environment is an ongoing
challenge for everyone.
Regional Water Quality Control Board
The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) was created by the Legislature in 1967.
The dual authority over water allocation and water quality protection enables the SWRCB to
provide comprehensive protection for California's waters.
There are nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCBs) within the State of
California. The mission of the RWQCBs is to develop and enforce water quality objectives
and implementation plans that will best protect the beneficial uses of the State's waters,
recognizing local differences in climate, topography, geology, and hydrology.
Each RWQCB has nine part-time members appointed by the Governor and confirmed by
the Senate. Regional Boards develop "basin plans" for their hydrologic areas, issue waste
discharge requirements, take enforcement action against violators, and monitor water
quality.
MCSTOPPP
MCSTOPPP is an acronym for the Marin County Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Program. Formed in 1993, MCSTOPPP is a joint effort of Marin's cities, towns and
unincorporated areas. Their goal is to:
    ♦ prevent stormwater pollution
    ♦ protect and enhance water quality in creeks and wetlands
    ♦ preserve beneficial uses of local waterways
    ♦ comply with State and Federal regulations
Though the County and each of the eleven cities and towns carry out their own individual
stormwater pollution prevention programs, MCSTOPPP provides for coordination and
consistency of approaches between the individual participants and documents their efforts
in annual reports. These reports include information on illegal discharges, street cleaning
efforts, creek maintenance, new development, and other issues of concern.

3.15        AIR QUALITY
AIR QUALITY CLIMATOLOGY
Corte Madera is located in eastern Marin County, which is part of the nine-county San
Francisco Bay Air Basin. Marin County is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the
east by San Pablo Bay and San Francisco Bay, on the south by the Golden Gate and on the
north by the Petaluma Gap. Corte Madera is partially sheltered from prevailing
northwesterly winds off the Pacific Ocean by elevated terrain. Temperatures in Corte
Madera are moderated by the cooling effect of the San Francisco Bay in summer and the
warming effect of the Bay in winter.
As a result of these climatological and topographic conditions, eastern Marin County (the
greater Corte Madera area) has a greater potential for air quality problems compared to the
rest of the County. Air pollution potential is a function of climate alone and not indicative of
actual air pollution levels. High air pollution potential means that the sheltering terrain and
relatively light winds often limit the atmosphere's ability to transport and dilute pollutants.
Marin County does not have many polluting industries and is located on the up-wind edge
of the air basin, so current air quality is good despite a high climatological pollution
potential.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND AIR QUALITY PROGRAMS
Efforts to combat air pollution began in the Bay Area in

ozone, and a State non-attainment area for carbon
monoxide, ozone and PM10. The entire Bay Area is
currently designated as a federal and State attainment
area for carbon monoxide, but remains an ozone non-attainment area.
AIR POLLUTANTS OF CONCERN IN THE BAY AREA AND CORTE MADERA
The federal ambient air quality standards are met in Marin County, but the more stringent
State standards for ozone and PM10 are exceeded. The following is a description of problem
pollutants in Corte Madera and the greater Bay Area.
Ozone
Ground level ozone, often referred to as smog, is not emitted directly, but is formed in the
atmosphere through complex chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and
reactive organic gases (ROG) in the presence of sunlight. The principal sources of NOx and
Corte Madera                                                                          General Plan
April 2009
                                               3-49
3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 ROG, often termed ozone precursors, are combustion processes (including automobiles) and
 evaporation of solvents, paints and fuels. Motor vehicles are the single largest source of
 ozone precursors emissions in the Bay Area. Exposure to ozone can cause eye irritation,
 aggravate respiratory diseases and damage lung tissue, as well as damage vegetation and
 reduce visibility.
 Carbon Monoxide
 Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that is formed by the incomplete
 combustion of fuels. Motor vehicles are by far the single largest source of CO in the Bay
 Area. In Corte Madera, vehicles traveling along Highway 101 contribute carbon monoxide
 to the local air quality conditions. At high concentrations, CO reduces the oxygen carrying
 capacity of blood and can cause headaches, dizziness, unconsciousness, and even death. CO
 is currently a minor concern in the Bay Area. While violations of the ambient air quality
 standards were recorded in all years prior to 1991, concentrations of this pollutant have
 been steadily declining, and the region has been designated an attainment area for both the
 state and federal ambient air quality standards.
 Particulate Matter
 Suspended particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of tiny particles that consists of dry
 solid fragments, solid cores with liquid coatings, and small droplets of liquid. These
 particles vary greatly in shape, size, and chemical composition and can be made up of many
 different materials such as metals, soot, soil, and dust. “Inhalable” PM consists of particles
 less than 10 microns in diameter, and is defined as “suspended particulate matter” or PM10.
 Fine particles are less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5). PM2.5, by definition, is included
 in PM10.
 Particulate matter (PM) includes a wide range of solid or liquid particles, including smoke,
 dust, aerosols and metallic oxides. There are many sources of PM emissions, including
 combustion, industrial processes, grading and construction, and motor vehicles. Of the PM
 emissions associated with motor vehicle use, some are tailpipe and tire wear emissions, but
 greater quantities are generated by re-suspended road dust. Consequently, improvements in
 motor vehicle engines and fuels have not reduced PM emissions as significantly as they
 have reduced emissions of other pollutants. Reductions in motor vehicle use are needed to
 significantly reduce PM emissions from re-suspended road dust.
 Particulate matter is a concern because it can bypass the body's natural filtration system
 more easily than larger particles, and can lodge deep in the lungs. Health effects of PM vary
 depending on a number of factors, including the type and size of the particle. Research has
 shown a correlation between high PM10, concentrations and increased mortality rates.
 Elevated levels can also aggravate chronic respiratory illness such as bronchitis and asthma.

Wood Smoke
Wood burning in fireplaces and stoves is a significant source of PM, particularly during
episodes when PM10 levels are highest. Wood smoke has long been identified as a
significant source of pollutants in urban and suburban areas as it contributes to particulate
matter and carbon monoxide concentrations, reduces visibility and contains numerous
Toxic Air Contaminants. Present controls on this source include the adoption of emission
standards for wood stoves and fireplace inserts. Interest in wood smoke regulation is likely
to increase in communities that experience substantial use of wood burning as a heating
source.
Toxic Air Contaminants
In addition to the criteria pollutants discussed above, toxic air contaminants (TACs) are
another group of pollutants of concern in the Bay Area. Unlike criteria pollutants, no safe
levels of exposure to TACs can be established. There are many different types of TACs, with
varying degrees of toxicity. Sources of TACs include industrial processes such as petroleum
refining and chrome plating operations, commercial operations such as gasoline stations
and dry cleaners, and motor vehicle exhaust. Public exposure to TACs can result from
emissions due to normal operations, as well as accidental releases of hazardous materials
during upset conditions. The health effects of TACs include cancer, birth defects,
neurological damage and death.
Diesel Exhaust
In 1988, the California Air Resources Board identified diesel engine particulate matter as a
toxic air contaminant and human carcinogen. The exhaust from diesel engines contains
hundreds of different gaseous and particulate components, many of which are toxic and
capable of penetrating deep into the lungs. Diesel exhaust is the most dangerous and
ubiquitous TAC in the Bay Area, with high concentrations near heavily traveled highways
and intersections.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The increasing amount of GHG emissions and criteria air pollutants stemming primarily
from the burning of fossil fuels is negatively impacting air quality in the atmosphere as well
as contributing to global climate change. GHGs include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
oxide, and sulfur hexafluoride, among others. Warmer temperatures associated with
climate change lead to conditions that are conducive to air pollution formation, including
higher ozone levels, causing increased asthma and respiratory illness.
Other Air Quality Issues
Other air quality issues of concern in the Bay Area include nuisance impacts of odors and
dust. The BAAQMD has enacted an odorous substances control program as part of its effort

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 to control the use and emission of odorous substances and nuisance dust within the Bay
 Area.
 Sensitive Receptors and Pollution Sources
 The BAAQMD defines sensitive receptors as facilities where sensitive receptor population
 groups (children, the elderly, the acutely ill and the chronically ill) are likely to be located.
 These land uses include schools, retirement homes, convalescent homes, hospitals and
 medical clinics. Such sensitive receptors are spread through most parts of Corte Madera.
 The BAAQMD inventory lists no major emitting facilities for criteria pollutants in Corte
 Madera. The current inventory does, however, identify numerous dry cleaners as sources of
 TACs spread over the commercial areas of Corte Madera. None of the sources of TACs in
 Corte Madera are considered as facilities with health risks requiring public notification
 under the Air Toxics Hot Spots Program.
 Relevance to General Plan
 There are currently no federal, state or local air quality related constraints on cities in the
 Bay Area. The BAAQMD has developed guidelines and thresholds of significance for local
 plans that affect CEQA documentation for the Corte Madera General Plan. Inconsistency
 with the most recently adopted Clean Air Plan (CAP) is considered a significant impact.
 According to the BAAQMD, the following criteria must be satisfied for a local plan to be
 determined consistent with the CAP and not have a significant air quality impact:
     ♦ The local plan should be consistent with the CAP population and Vehicle Miles
         Traveled (VMT) assumptions. This is demonstrated if the population growth over
         the planning period will not exceed the values included in the current CAP, and
     ♦ The local plan demonstrates reasonable efforts to implement the Transportation
         Control Measures (TCMs) included in the CAP that identify cities as implementing
         agencies.
 Of particular importance is mitigation of air quality impacts from projects that might result
 in sensitive receptors’ exposure to high levels of diesel exhaust. The design, layout and
 orientation of high-density housing, for example, will need to minimize exposure of
 residents to diesel exhaust. The BAAQMD (together with five other regional agencies)
 encourages compact, infill development near public transit. High density development with
 a transit orientation is considered "smart growth" as a means of combating the increasing
 use of automobiles in the region.

3.0 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY
 3.17        CULTURAL AND HISTORIC RESOURCES
 Numerous prehistoric archaeological sites have been identified near former or existing
 marsh boundaries, watercourses, the base of foothills, and near vegetation throughout the
 Bay Area, including Corte Madera. The California Archaeological Inventory has identified
 eight recorded prehistoric archaeological sites within the Town of Corte Madera and two
 adjacent archaeological sites within the Ring Mountain Preserve. Areas that have not been
 part of a project environmental review (this includes ninety percent of the Town) have never
 been studied, so there is a high probability of potentially unrecognized prehistoric and
 historic cultural resources within Corte Madera.
 The earliest archaeological sites in the San Francisco Bay region date from approximately
 4,000 to 7,000 years ago, when populations occupied areas near bayshore and marsh
 habitats. Archaeological sites dating between 1,500 to 1,700 years ago display an increasing
 complexity in artifact style. The Coast Miwok occupied the area now known as Corte
 Madera. Local prehistoric site findings include shell midden, petroglyphs, bedrock mortar,
 and other evidence of occupation. Indigenous populations within Corte Madera, disrupted
 by the Spanish Mission System, would most likely have been incorporated into the missions
 established in San Rafael, San Francisco, or Sonoma.
 Under State guidelines (State Office of Historic Preservation), any building constructed
 more than 45 years ago could possibly be identified as an historic structure. According to
 the State Office of Historic Preservation’s Historic Property Data File for Marin County,
 several historic properties within Corte Madera are listed in State and Federal inventories.
 Several of these identified historic resources are located within the Old Corte Madera
 Square area, including Holy Innocents Church, Moore’s Hall, and Parkside Hotel.

         potential undiscovered Native American cultural resources exist at the project site,
         consult with California Native American Tribes that have been identified by the
         Native American Heritage Commission per Government Code §65352.3. Consider
         recommendations from the Tribes regarding the location of cultural places,
         appropriate conservation measures, and the qualifications of archaeologists to
         conduct further investigations when additional research is required.
         Where historic and cultural such resources are identified, measures shall be
         identified to avoid impact to the resource, where feasible. Where avoidance is not
         practical, mitigations shall identify how the impact may be minimized.

4.1          INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this Element is to provide an overview
of the means of transport to, from and within the Town,
and to address how different ways of getting around
can complement each other to make Corte Madera’s
circulation system work more efficiently. The most
common means of transportation is the automobile, and
much of the planning for circulation within Corte
Madera has focused on vehicular traffic. However,
bicycles and pedestrians move throughout the Town,
and Corte Madera’s interest in community sustainability emphasizes the need for
improvements and enhancements to the full range of circulation and transportation
facilities.
4.2          REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
California Government Code §65302 mandates that the General Plan include:
         “A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of
         existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes,
         terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated
         with the land use element of the plan (§65302(b)).”
TRAFFIC IMPACT FEES
The Town currently uses a Traffic Mitigation Improvement Fund program adopted in 1984.
As addressed in Policies contained in Section 4.5, a new Impact Fee program should be
adopted to better reflect current issues and impacts related to Town facilities, including
roadways, bicycle and pedestrian paths.
RELATED TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES
California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)
Caltrans is responsible for planning, designing, building, operating and maintaining
California's state highway system. Highway 101, traversing Corte Madera on a north to
south orientation, is managed by Caltrans as part of the California Freeway and Expressway
System.
Metropolitan Transportation Commission
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is the transportation planning,
coordinating and financing agency for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, including
Corte Madera                                                                        General Plan

4.0 CIRCULATION
 Marin County. The MTC prepares a 25-year Regional Transportation Plan (last prepared in
 2001, and updated every five years), which guides funding priorities for regional
 development of mass transit, highway, airport, seaport, railroad, bicycle and pedestrian
 facilities.
 Marin County
 As one of the communities located within Marin County, the Town of Corte Madera is
 impacted by County policies regarding traffic and circulation. The County recently
 completed a General Plan update, including revisions to County-wide transportation
 policies.
 Transportation Authority of Marin
 The Transportation Authority of Marin (TAM) is a Joint Powers Agency established
 between the County and all cities within the County, including Corte Madera, to address
 Marin's unique transportation issues and to fulfill the legislative requirements of
 Propositions 111 and 116, approved in June 1990.
 City of Larkspur
 The City of Larkspur and the Town of Corte Madera share traffic corridors providing local
 access to community facilities. As a result, circulation issues present in Corte Madera
 significantly affect the City of Larkspur, and vice versa, particularly with respect to
 commute patterns for workers accessing Highway 101.
 NON-PROFIT GROUPS
 Marin County Bicycle Coalition
 The Marin County Bicycle Coalition (MCBC) is a non-profit membership organization
 founded in 1998. Their mission is to promote safe bicycling for everyday transportation and
 recreation.
 4.3          MOVEMENT THROUGH THE COMMUNITY
 FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
 Streets and highways in the Town are described by their functional classification. These
 classifications identify the purpose of the streets and highways relative to their overall
 function in the distribution of different types of trips using the facilities. The following
 classifications are relevant to the Town’s circulation system:
     ♦ Freeways serve both inter-regional and intra-regional circulation needs. These facilities
          are typically accessed by collector or arterial roadways and have no at-grade crossings.
General Plan                                                                      Corte Madera
                                                                                     April 2009

        These facilities have the highest carrying capacity with the maximum speed limits
        allowed by law.
    ♦ Arterials provide primary connections between major areas within the Town and
        also distribute traffic between adjacent communities. While some land uses have
        direct access to an arterial, an arterial’s primary purpose is to provide connections
        between major areas. Speed limits generally range from 30 to 50 miles per hour
        (mph).
    ♦ Collectors typically serve intra-city, rather than regional, circulation needs. Their
        primary function is to provide access to adjacent properties and connections
        between local roads and other roadways that are higher in the hierarchy of
        classification. Travel speeds on collectors generally range between 25 mph and 45
        mph.
    ♦ Local Streets provide access to adjacent properties and distribute traffic to collectors.
        Travel speeds on local streets typically range from 25 to 35 mph.
VEHICULAR CIRCULATION
Key Town Roadways
    ♦ U.S. (Highway) 101 is an eight-lane freeway that bisects the Town on a north-south
        axis. It provides regional access to Marin County and points beyond. Full access to
        the Town is provided at an interchange with Tamalpais Drive. Southbound access is
        provided by slip ramps at Fifer Avenue and Madera Boulevard, and northbound
        access is available at a slip ramp at Industrial Way.
    ♦ Tamalpais Drive is an east-west two-to-four lane arterial that extends from Corte
        Madera Avenue to Redwood Highway. It has a full access interchange at Highway
        101.
    ♦ Corte Madera Avenue is a north-south two-lane collector that extends from
        Larkspur in the north as Magnolia Avenue and south into Mill Valley as Camino
        Alto. It acts as a “main street” for some of the Town’s older neighborhoods.
    ♦ Fifer Avenue is an east-west two-lane collector that extends from the Highway 101
        ramps to Lucky Drive.
    ♦ Nellen Avenue is a north-south two-lane collector that extends from Lucky Drive to
        Fifer Avenue. It also extends from Wornum Drive north to a cul-de-sac just south of
        Fifer Avenue.
    ♦ Redwood Highway is a north south two to four lane collector that extends from
        Tamalpais Drive to Greenbrae Boardwalk, generally paralleling Highway 101 on the
        east side of the freeway.
    ♦ Madera Boulevard is a north-south two to four lane arterial that extends from Casa
        Buena Drive to Highway 101.

        ♦ Paradise Drive is an east-west two- to four-lane collector that extends from San
             Clemente Drive into Tiburon.
  Major roadways in the Town are shown in Figure 4.1.
  LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS
  The operating conditions experienced by motorists are described as “levels of service”
  (LOS). Level of service is a qualitative measure of the effect of a number of factors,
  including speed and travel time, traffic interruptions, freedom to maneuver, driving
  comfort, and convenience. Levels of service are designated “A” through “F” from best to
  worst, which cover the entire range of traffic operations that might occur. Table 4.1

An important goal is to maintain acceptable LOS along the Town’s road network. To
accomplish this, the Town, Caltrans, and other local agencies adopt minimum levels of
service in an attempt to control congestion that may result as new development occurs.
SOURCES OF TOWN VEHICULAR TRAFFIC
Much of the traffic volume in Corte Madera is closely related to employee commuting
practices and patterns. In 2002, approximately 85% of the employed residents in Corte
Madera worked outside of the Town (July 2002 Background Report). Based on data from
the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 3,850 housing units in Corte Madera, and
on average in Marin County, there are 1.21 workers for every residence. Assuming each of
these workers make two commute trips per day (one to work, and one returning), this
would generate approximately 9,240 commute trips per day (3,850 units x 1.2 workers per
unit x 2 trips per worker per day).
Corte Madera’s contiguous border with the City of Larkspur and access to Highway 101
invites added commuter traffic through Town. A portion of the traffic passing through the
Old Corte Madera Square area is traveling to and from Larkspur via Corte Madera
Avenue/Magnolia Avenue. These vehicles use Tamalpais Drive to access Highway 101.
While an alternative access route to Highway 101 is available to Larkspur residents, via
Doherty Drive, this route is considered inconvenient because of the many turns needed to
travel between the eastern end of Doherty Drive and Highway 101. Similarly, traffic moving
along San Clemente Drive includes vehicles from Tiburon making their way to and from
Highway 101 at the Tamalpais Drive interchange.
The presence of Highway 101 as a bisecting, north-south freeway in Corte Madera has
impacted Town circulation in two aspects. First, the freeway has created a physical barrier
for local circulation between the east and west sides of Town, broken only by the vehicle
overcrossing at Tamalpais Drive, the vehicle undercrossing at Wornum Drive, and
pedestrian/bicycle crossings (Tamalpais Drive, Wornum Drive, and an overcrossing
structure near the Town limit by Larkspur). Second, the freeway has provided regional
access for two regional shopping centers, the Village Shopping Center and Town Center,
which generate vehicular traffic from both regional shoppers and out-of-town employees,
particularly during seasonal shopping periods.
Congestion on Town streets also can be attributed to activities occurring within Corte
Madera, including morning and afternoon peak hour trips related to student drop-off at
public and private schools. The problem is exacerbated by local street design, which may
consist of narrow residential streets leading to the schools, along with limited on-site
(school) drop-off and pick-up areas, leading to temporary backup conditions. The design of
several key intersections also causes congestion on Town streets. The intersections that
serve the Village Shopping Center and Town Center, Tamalpais Drive/San Clemente Drive
and Tamalpais Drive/Madera Boulevard respectively, become “choke points” during the
holiday shopping periods. The roadways feeding these intersections are adequate, but the
intersections could be redesigned to reduce congestion.

  EXISTING LEVELS OF SERVICE
  Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts were collected in 2002 on key roadway segments and
  PM peak hour counts were taken at key intersections throughout the town. The
  corresponding LOS on the roadways and at the intersections are shown in Tables 4.2 and
  4.3, respectively.

  All Town roadways currently operate at LOS C or higher with the exception of Corte Madera
  Avenue north of Redwood Avenue, which operates at LOS E, and Tamalpais Drive
  immediately east and west of Highway 101, which operates at LOS E and D, respectively. In
  addition, Caltrans-maintained Highway 101 operates at LOS F.

All roadway intersections studied currently operate at LOS C or higher, with the exception
of the Corte Madera Avenue/Redwood Avenue intersection, which operated at LOS D
during the peak hour prior to signalization. This intersection has not been studied since
improvements were installed in July 2007. Local circulation policy for cities typically focuses
on regulation of LOS for roadway intersections (which can be controlled through traffic
signage or signalization, if needed) as opposed to regulation of LOS for roadway segments.
FUTURE LEVELS OF SERVICE
The Town’s goal for future levels of service is to avoid a degradation of existing intersection
LOS. With some limited exceptions, intersections in the Town are projected to operate at
LOS D or better. The exception is the intersections in the vicinity of the Tamalpais Drive
interchange on Highway 101.
Vehicular Circulation Improvement Plans
Connectivity between the east and west sides of Town is a common concern among Town
residents. Highway 101 geographically divides the Town with the population almost
evenly split on either side. Approximately 55% of the Town’s population resides west of
Highway 101, and 45% of the population resides on the east side. Access across Highway
101 is limited to the Tamalpais Drive interchange, the Wornum Drive underpass, and the
pedestrian overcrossing north of Wornum Drive.
Certain community resources used by residents on both sides of Highway 101 are located
west of Highway 101, including Neil Cummins Elementary School, the Post Office, Town
Park, and Town Hall. Construction of improved or new connections between the east and
west sides of Town, reducing the barrier effect of Highway 101, would improve intermodal
travel and increase a sense of “connectivity” amongst Town residents. Potential
opportunities for connections include:
    ♦ Improvements to the existing Tamalpais Drive/Highway 101 overcrossing, to
        upgrade bicycle and pedestrian access and improve vehicular movement.
    ♦ Construction of a separate bicycle/pedestrian overcrossing, north (connecting The
        Village and Town Center shopping malls) or just south of the existing Tamalpais
        Drive/Highway 101 overcrossing (connecting Paradise Drive and Meadowsweet
        Drive).
Costs for improving the Tamalpais Drive interchange on Highway 101, including bicycle,
pedestrian, and vehicle improvements, are estimated to be in excess of $10 million for
expansion or reconstruction.
The Town of Corte Madera Bicycle Transportation Plan contains an estimate of the cost for a
bicycle/pedestrian overcrossing of Highway 101 south of Tamalpais Drive. This facility
was estimated to cost $2 million in 2001.

4.0 CIRCULATION
 The Town has also identified several other areas that would benefit from circulation
 improvements, including:
     ♦ Improving Highway 101 access and safety. The Transportation Authority of Marin
         (TAM) is overseeing studies to address circulation issues related to the Highway
         101/Sir Francis Drake Boulevard interchange, located just north of the Town limits.
         South of this interchange are interchanges (on- and off-ramps) at Fifer
         Avenue/Industrial Way and Madera Boulevard, which are spaced below
         recommended standards and result in significant traffic backups. Alternatives for
         improving traffic flow in the TAM study include suggestions to eliminate or create
         interchanges within Corte Madera. The General Plan identifies improvements to the
         Tamalpais/Paradise Drive – Highway 101 interchange, and related issues of bicycle
         and pedestrian access, as the Town’s top circulation priority.
     ♦ San Clemente Drive improvements. San Clemente Drive is a “gateway” to Corte
         Madera. As such, enhancement of the road to create a “boulevard” character,
         including a landscaped median, decorative street lighting, and protected pedestrian
         and bicycle corridors, is an important goal for the Town. Some improvements to San
         Clemente Drive are now scheduled.
 The Town’s goals, policies and implementation measures related to vehicular circulation,
 included in Section 4.5, address these improvements more specifically.
 BICYCLE CIRCULATION
 Corte Madera’s commitment to community
 sustainability emphasizes the importance of bicycle
 mobility within the Town and to destinations beyond
 the Town limits.
 The Town currently has approximately 4½ miles of
 bike lanes/routes. These include facilities along
 Paradise Drive, San Clemente Drive, Tamalpais Drive, Tamal Vista Boulevard, Corte Madera
 Avenue and Lakeside Drive. In July of 2001, the Town adopted the Bicycle Transportation Plan,
 which inventoried existing bike facilities and recommended future improvements. The Town
 spends approximately $50,000 per year on bikeway improvements, including street widening,
 resurfacing, maintenance of existing paths, and installation of landscaping.
 The Bicycle Transportation Plan distinguishes between bikeways as follows:
     ♦ A Bike Path is also known as a Class I Bikeway. It provides for pedestrian and bicycle use
         on a paved right-of-way separate from any street or highway. Under Caltrans standards,
         it must be at least 8 feet wide for a two-way path, although the Town prefers widths of 12
         feet where space allows.
     ♦ A Bike Lane is also known as a Class II Bikeway. It provides for a striped and stenciled
         lane for one-way travel on a street or highway. A Bike Lane has a minimum standard
         width of four feet.

                                                                                     April 2009

    ♦ A Bike Route is also known as a Class III Bikeway. It provides for shared use of a
        street with pedestrians or motor vehicle traffic, and may be identified only by
        signing. Bike routes usually connect other bike lane segments.
Bicycle facilities and paths are summarized in Table 4.4 and shown in Figure 4.2.
Regionally, bicycle trails extend well beyond the borders of Corte Madera, connecting to
open space areas and to bicycle paths along public roads and trail systems. Corte Madera
and Marin County are unique in that they provide popular, regional access for recreational
bicyclists. Marin County prepared a Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan in June 2001
addressing County-wide bicycle and pedestrian systems. The Plan addresses various goals
and objectives for maintaining existing systems as well as possible construction or upgrades
to improve the system to meet the needs of County bicyclists and pedestrians. Marin
County has a well-established “Share the Road”
program that is intended to reduce conflicts between
vehicles and bicyclists sharing County roadways.
Additionally, a multi-jurisdictional effort is
underway to complete the Bay Trail, which will
provide a continuous bicycle path around the San
Francisco Bay.       The Bay Trail would proceed
through Corte Madera along portions of Paradise Drive and along Bay frontage on or near
the old railroad levee.

 BICYCLE CIRCULATION IMPROVEMENT PLANS
 The Town’s Bicycle Transportation Plan identified several opportunities for improvements to
 bicycle circulation systems that would create expanded opportunities for non-vehicular travel
 in the area through greater interconnectivity within the Town and to other cities. The
 abandoned historic railroad rights-of-way offer many opportunities for bicycle and pedestrian
 pathways. A number of the Plan’s recommended improvement projects are listed below.
 Some of the improvements are not currently feasible due to limited right-of-way options for
 constructing improvements or excessive costs for construction:
      ♦ Improve bicycle/pedestrian access across Highway 101. Several alternatives exist to
           achieve this goal, including improving the existing overpass on Tamalpais Drive or
           construction of an overpass either to the north or south of Tamalpais Drive.
      ♦ Construction improvements to the Corte Madera Creek Trestle, linking Corte Madera and
           the Larkspur Ferry Terminal near the Greenbrae Boardwalk.
      ♦ Construction improvements for the Cal Park Hill Tunnel linking Larkspur and San Rafael
           further north of the Larkspur Ferry Terminal. Additionally, local bicycle advocacy groups
           have suggested reopening Alto Tunnel linking Corte Madera with Mill Valley.
      ♦ Improvements to bicycle lanes along Tamalpais Drive, Paradise Drive and Corte Madera
           Avenue where bicycle lanes are narrow or unstriped.
General Plan                                                                         Corte Madera

PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION
Pedestrian movement through the Town occurs via a series of sidewalks on major streets.
As previously discussed, Highway 101 acts as a partial barrier to connectivity between the
east and west areas of the Town, with pedestrian access limited to the Tamalpais Drive
interchange, the Wornum Drive pedestrian undercrossing, and the overcrossing at the north
edge of Town on the Larkspur border. As discussed in Chapter 6 (Parks and Recreation),
the Town also has a number of unpaved hiking trails in its hillside areas, including in the
Ring Mountain, Chapman Hill and Christmas Tree Hill areas. The Town maintains portions
of the following trails (which include trails improved with stairways) through its Capital
Improvement Program budget:
    ♦ Hill Path                                 ♦ Short Path
    ♦ California Lane                           ♦ Jean Bean
    ♦ Portola Stairs                            ♦ Golden Stairs
    ♦ Ridge Way Stairs                          ♦ Spring Trail
In certain instances, pedestrian and bicycle paths are
combined (in joint use) along paved paths, such as
along paths around and north of Town Park or along
Bayside Trail Park.
The Town recently adopted a Transition Plan that will
provide      for   phased     pedestrian     circulation
improvements to increase public accessibility
consistent with requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
Key trails are shown in Figure 4.2.

BUS SERVICE
Marin Transit, in contract with The Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transit District
provides transit service in the Town of Corte Madera. Service routes and stops vary over
time, in part due to budgetary restrictions of the District. Commuter service to locations in
Marin County and Downtown San Francisco are currently provided.
The Marin Airporter provides service to and from San Francisco International Airport from
locations throughout Marin County.

4.0 CIRCULATION
         Implementation Program CIR-1.1.a:         Level of Service Standards
         The town shall strive to maintain Level of Service (LOS) D operation during the
         weekday morning and evening peak periods at intersections of an arterial street with
         either another arterial or a collector street and intersections of two collector streets.
         For projected future conditions the LOS is to be calculated using the average traffic
         demand over the highest 60-minute period. For all types of controls the Level of
         Service standard is to be applied to the average operation of the intersection, and not
         that for any single movement or approach. Exceptions to meeting this standard
         include:
         1) Stop-controlled minor street approaches to either collector or arterial streets, where
             safety shall be the primary consideration;
         2) Locations where the Town Engineer deems improvement to be technically,
             financially, or environmentally infeasible;
         3) Conditions where the improvement would result in significant adverse impacts to
             other travel modes, including walking, bicycling, or transit; or
         4) Locations where attainment would ensure the loss of an area’s unique character.

4.1          INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this Element is to provide an overview
of the means of transport to, from and within the Town,
and to address how different ways of getting around
can complement each other to make Corte Madera’s
circulation system work more efficiently. The most
common means of transportation is the automobile, and
much of the planning for circulation within Corte
Madera has focused on vehicular traffic. However,
bicycles and pedestrians move throughout the Town,
and Corte Madera’s interest in community sustainability emphasizes the need for
improvements and enhancements to the full range of circulation and transportation
facilities.
4.2          REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
California Government Code §65302 mandates that the General Plan include:
         “A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of
         existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes,
         terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated
         with the land use element of the plan (§65302(b)).”
TRAFFIC IMPACT FEES
The Town currently uses a Traffic Mitigation Improvement Fund program adopted in 1984.
As addressed in Policies contained in Section 4.5, a new Impact Fee program should be
adopted to better reflect current issues and impacts related to Town facilities, including
roadways, bicycle and pedestrian paths.
RELATED TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES
California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)
Caltrans is responsible for planning, designing, building, operating and maintaining
California's state highway system. Highway 101, traversing Corte Madera on a north to
south orientation, is managed by Caltrans as part of the California Freeway and Expressway
System.

 Marin County. The MTC prepares a 25-year Regional Transportation Plan (last prepared in
 2001, and updated every five years), which guides funding priorities for regional
 development of mass transit, highway, airport, seaport, railroad, bicycle and pedestrian
 facilities.
 Marin County
 As one of the communities located within Marin County, the Town of Corte Madera is
 impacted by County policies regarding traffic and circulation. The County recently
 completed a General Plan update, including revisions to County-wide transportation
 policies.
 Transportation Authority of Marin
 The Transportation Authority of Marin (TAM) is a Joint Powers Agency established
 between the County and all cities within the County, including Corte Madera, to address
 Marin's unique transportation issues and to fulfill the legislative requirements of
 Propositions 111 and 116, approved in June 1990.
 City of Larkspur
 The City of Larkspur and the Town of Corte Madera share traffic corridors providing local
 access to community facilities. As a result, circulation issues present in Corte Madera
 significantly affect the City of Larkspur, and vice versa, particularly with respect to
 commute patterns for workers accessing Highway 101.
 NON-PROFIT GROUPS
 Marin County Bicycle Coalition
 The Marin County Bicycle Coalition (MCBC) is a non-profit membership organization
 founded in 1998. Their mission is to promote safe bicycling for everyday transportation and
 recreation.
 4.3          MOVEMENT THROUGH THE COMMUNITY
 FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
 Streets and highways in the Town are described by their functional classification. These
 classifications identify the purpose of the streets and highways relative to their overall
 function in the distribution of different types of trips using the facilities. The following
 classifications are relevant to the Town’s circulation system:
     ♦ Freeways serve both inter-regional and intra-regional circulation needs. These facilities
          are typically accessed by collector or arterial roadways and have no at-grade crossings.
General Plan                                                                      Corte Madera

        These facilities have the highest carrying capacity with the maximum speed limits
        allowed by law.
    ♦ Arterials provide primary connections between major areas within the Town and
        also distribute traffic between adjacent communities. While some land uses have
        direct access to an arterial, an arterial’s primary purpose is to provide connections
        between major areas. Speed limits generally range from 30 to 50 miles per hour
        (mph).
    ♦ Collectors typically serve intra-city, rather than regional, circulation needs. Their
        primary function is to provide access to adjacent properties and connections
        between local roads and other roadways that are higher in the hierarchy of
        classification. Travel speeds on collectors generally range between 25 mph and 45
        mph.
    ♦ Local Streets provide access to adjacent properties and distribute traffic to collectors.
        Travel speeds on local streets typically range from 25 to 35 mph.
VEHICULAR CIRCULATION
Key Town Roadways
    ♦ U.S. (Highway) 101 is an eight-lane freeway that bisects the Town on a north-south
        axis. It provides regional access to Marin County and points beyond. Full access to
        the Town is provided at an interchange with Tamalpais Drive. Southbound access is
        provided by slip ramps at Fifer Avenue and Madera Boulevard, and northbound
        access is available at a slip ramp at Industrial Way.
    ♦ Tamalpais Drive is an east-west two-to-four lane arterial that extends from Corte
        Madera Avenue to Redwood Highway. It has a full access interchange at Highway
        101.
    ♦ Corte Madera Avenue is a north-south two-lane collector that extends from
        Larkspur in the north as Magnolia Avenue and south into Mill Valley as Camino
        Alto. It acts as a “main street” for some of the Town’s older neighborhoods.
    ♦ Fifer Avenue is an east-west two-lane collector that extends from the Highway 101
        ramps to Lucky Drive.
    ♦ Nellen Avenue is a north-south two-lane collector that extends from Lucky Drive to
        Fifer Avenue. It also extends from Wornum Drive north to a cul-de-sac just south of
        Fifer Avenue.
    ♦ Redwood Highway is a north south two to four lane collector that extends from
        Tamalpais Drive to Greenbrae Boardwalk, generally paralleling Highway 101 on the
        east side of the freeway.
    ♦ Madera Boulevard is a north-south two to four lane arterial that extends from Casa
        Buena Drive to Highway 101.

  LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS
  The operating conditions experienced by motorists are described as “levels of service”
  (LOS). Level of service is a qualitative measure of the effect of a number of factors,
  including speed and travel time, traffic interruptions, freedom to maneuver, driving
  comfort, and convenience. Levels of service are designated “A” through “F” from best to
  worst, which cover the entire range of traffic operations that might occur. Table 4.1
  provides a description of traffic intersection operations under each LOS.

An important goal is to maintain acceptable LOS along the Town’s road network. To
accomplish this, the Town, Caltrans, and other local agencies adopt minimum levels of
service in an attempt to control congestion that may result as new development occurs.
SOURCES OF TOWN VEHICULAR TRAFFIC
Much of the traffic volume in Corte Madera is closely related to employee commuting
practices and patterns. In 2002, approximately 85% of the employed residents in Corte
Madera worked outside of the Town (July 2002 Background Report). Based on data from
the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 3,850 housing units in Corte Madera, and
on average in Marin County, there are 1.21 workers for every residence. Assuming each of
these workers make two commute trips per day (one to work, and one returning), this
would generate approximately 9,240 commute trips per day (3,850 units x 1.2 workers per
unit x 2 trips per worker per day).
Corte Madera’s contiguous border with the City of Larkspur and access to Highway 101
invites added commuter traffic through Town. A portion of the traffic passing through the
Old Corte Madera Square area is traveling to and from Larkspur via Corte Madera
Avenue/Magnolia Avenue. These vehicles use Tamalpais Drive to access Highway 101.
While an alternative access route to Highway 101 is available to Larkspur residents, via
Doherty Drive, this route is considered inconvenient because of the many turns needed to
travel between the eastern end of Doherty Drive and Highway 101. Similarly, traffic moving
along San Clemente Drive includes vehicles from Tiburon making their way to and from
Highway 101 at the Tamalpais Drive interchange.
The presence of Highway 101 as a bisecting, north-south freeway in Corte Madera has
impacted Town circulation in two aspects. First, the freeway has created a physical barrier
for local circulation between the east and west sides of Town, broken only by the vehicle
overcrossing at Tamalpais Drive, the vehicle undercrossing at Wornum Drive, and
pedestrian/bicycle crossings (Tamalpais Drive, Wornum Drive, and an overcrossing
structure near the Town limit by Larkspur). Second, the freeway has provided regional
access for two regional shopping centers, the Village Shopping Center and Town Center,
which generate vehicular traffic from both regional shoppers and out-of-town employees,
particularly during seasonal shopping periods.
Congestion on Town streets also can be attributed to activities occurring within Corte
Madera, including morning and afternoon peak hour trips related to student drop-off at
public and private schools. The problem is exacerbated by local street design, which may
consist of narrow residential streets leading to the schools, along with limited on-site
(school) drop-off and pick-up areas, leading to temporary backup conditions. The design of
several key intersections also causes congestion on Town streets. The intersections that
serve the Village Shopping Center and Town Center, Tamalpais Drive/San Clemente Drive
and Tamalpais Drive/Madera Boulevard respectively, become “choke points” during the
holiday shopping periods. The roadways feeding these intersections are adequate, but the
intersections could be redesigned to reduce congestion.

  Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts were collected in 2002 on key roadway segments and
  PM peak hour counts were taken at key intersections throughout the town. The
  corresponding LOS on the roadways and at the intersections are shown in Tables 4.2 and
  4.3, respectively.

  All Town roadways currently operate at LOS C or higher with the exception of Corte Madera
  Avenue north of Redwood Avenue, which operates at LOS E, and Tamalpais Drive
  immediately east and west of Highway 101, which operates at LOS E and D, respectively. In
  addition, Caltrans-maintained Highway 101 operates at LOS F.

All roadway intersections studied currently operate at LOS C or higher, with the exception
of the Corte Madera Avenue/Redwood Avenue intersection, which operated at LOS D
during the peak hour prior to signalization. This intersection has not been studied since
improvements were installed in July 2007. Local circulation policy for cities typically focuses
on regulation of LOS for roadway intersections (which can be controlled through traffic
signage or signalization, if needed) as opposed to regulation of LOS for roadway segments.
FUTURE LEVELS OF SERVICE
The Town’s goal for future levels of service is to avoid a degradation of existing intersection
LOS. With some limited exceptions, intersections in the Town are projected to operate at
LOS D or better. The exception is the intersections in the vicinity of the Tamalpais Drive
interchange on Highway 101.
Vehicular Circulation Improvement Plans
Connectivity between the east and west sides of Town is a common concern among Town
residents. Highway 101 geographically divides the Town with the population almost
evenly split on either side. Approximately 55% of the Town’s population resides west of
Highway 101, and 45% of the population resides on the east side. Access across Highway
101 is limited to the Tamalpais Drive interchange, the Wornum Drive underpass, and the
pedestrian overcrossing north of Wornum Drive.
Certain community resources used by residents on both sides of Highway 101 are located
west of Highway 101, including Neil Cummins Elementary School, the Post Office, Town
Park, and Town Hall. Construction of improved or new connections between the east and
west sides of Town, reducing the barrier effect of Highway 101, would improve intermodal
travel and increase a sense of “connectivity” amongst Town residents. Potential
opportunities for connections include:
    ♦ Improvements to the existing Tamalpais Drive/Highway 101 overcrossing, to
        upgrade bicycle and pedestrian access and improve vehicular movement.
    ♦ Construction of a separate bicycle/pedestrian overcrossing, north (connecting The
        Village and Town Center shopping malls) or just south of the existing Tamalpais
        Drive/Highway 101 overcrossing (connecting Paradise Drive and Meadowsweet
        Drive).
Costs for improving the Tamalpais Drive interchange on Highway 101, including bicycle,
pedestrian, and vehicle improvements, are estimated to be in excess of $10 million for
expansion or reconstruction.
The Town of Corte Madera Bicycle Transportation Plan contains an estimate of the cost for a
bicycle/pedestrian overcrossing of Highway 101 south of Tamalpais Drive. This facility
was estimated to cost $2 million in 2001.

4.0 CIRCULATION
 The Town has also identified several other areas that would benefit from circulation
 improvements, including:
     ♦ Improving Highway 101 access and safety. The Transportation Authority of Marin
         (TAM) is overseeing studies to address circulation issues related to the Highway
         101/Sir Francis Drake Boulevard interchange, located just north of the Town limits.
         South of this interchange are interchanges (on- and off-ramps) at Fifer
         Avenue/Industrial Way and Madera Boulevard, which are spaced below
         recommended standards and result in significant traffic backups. Alternatives for
         improving traffic flow in the TAM study include suggestions to eliminate or create
         interchanges within Corte Madera. The General Plan identifies improvements to the
         Tamalpais/Paradise Drive – Highway 101 interchange, and related issues of bicycle
         and pedestrian access, as the Town’s top circulation priority.
     ♦ San Clemente Drive improvements. San Clemente Drive is a “gateway” to Corte
         Madera. As such, enhancement of the road to create a “boulevard” character,
         including a landscaped median, decorative street lighting, and protected pedestrian
         and bicycle corridors, is an important goal for the Town. Some improvements to San
         Clemente Drive are now scheduled.
 The Town’s goals, policies and implementation measures related to vehicular circulation,
 included in Section 4.5, address these improvements more specifically.
 BICYCLE CIRCULATION
 Corte Madera’s commitment to community
 sustainability emphasizes the importance of bicycle
 mobility within the Town and to destinations beyond
 the Town limits.
 The Town currently has approximately 4½ miles of
 bike lanes/routes. These include facilities along
 Paradise Drive, San Clemente Drive, Tamalpais Drive, Tamal Vista Boulevard, Corte Madera
 Avenue and Lakeside Drive. In July of 2001, the Town adopted the Bicycle Transportation Plan,
 which inventoried existing bike facilities and recommended future improvements. The Town
 spends approximately $50,000 per year on bikeway improvements, including street widening,
 resurfacing, maintenance of existing paths, and installation of landscaping.
 The Bicycle Transportation Plan distinguishes between bikeways as follows:
     ♦ A Bike Path is also known as a Class I Bikeway. It provides for pedestrian and bicycle use
         on a paved right-of-way separate from any street or highway. Under Caltrans standards,
         it must be at least 8 feet wide for a two-way path, although the Town prefers widths of 12
         feet where space allows.
     ♦ A Bike Lane is also known as a Class II Bikeway. It provides for a striped and stenciled
         lane for one-way travel on a street or highway. A Bike Lane has a minimum standard
         width of four feet.

    ♦ A Bike Route is also known as a Class III Bikeway. It provides for shared use of a
        street with pedestrians or motor vehicle traffic, and may be identified only by
        signing. Bike routes usually connect other bike lane segments.
Bicycle facilities and paths are summarized in Table 4.4 and shown in Figure 4.2.
Regionally, bicycle trails extend well beyond the borders of Corte Madera, connecting to
open space areas and to bicycle paths along public roads and trail systems. Corte Madera
and Marin County are unique in that they provide popular, regional access for recreational
bicyclists. Marin County prepared a Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan in June 2001
addressing County-wide bicycle and pedestrian systems. The Plan addresses various goals
and objectives for maintaining existing systems as well as possible construction or upgrades
to improve the system to meet the needs of County bicyclists and pedestrians. Marin
County has a well-established “Share the Road”
program that is intended to reduce conflicts between
vehicles and bicyclists sharing County roadways.
Additionally, a multi-jurisdictional effort is
underway to complete the Bay Trail, which will
provide a continuous bicycle path around the San
Francisco Bay.       The Bay Trail would proceed
through Corte Madera along portions of Paradise Drive and along Bay frontage on or near
the old railroad levee.

 BICYCLE CIRCULATION IMPROVEMENT PLANS
 The Town’s Bicycle Transportation Plan identified several opportunities for improvements to
 bicycle circulation systems that would create expanded opportunities for non-vehicular travel
 in the area through greater interconnectivity within the Town and to other cities. The
 abandoned historic railroad rights-of-way offer many opportunities for bicycle and pedestrian
 pathways. A number of the Plan’s recommended improvement projects are listed below.
 Some of the improvements are not currently feasible due to limited right-of-way options for
 constructing improvements or excessive costs for construction:
      ♦ Improve bicycle/pedestrian access across Highway 101. Several alternatives exist to
           achieve this goal, including improving the existing overpass on Tamalpais Drive or
           construction of an overpass either to the north or south of Tamalpais Drive.
      ♦ Construction improvements to the Corte Madera Creek Trestle, linking Corte Madera and
           the Larkspur Ferry Terminal near the Greenbrae Boardwalk.
      ♦ Construction improvements for the Cal Park Hill Tunnel linking Larkspur and San Rafael
           further north of the Larkspur Ferry Terminal. Additionally, local bicycle advocacy groups
           have suggested reopening Alto Tunnel linking Corte Madera with Mill Valley.
      ♦ Improvements to bicycle lanes along Tamalpais Drive, Paradise Drive and Corte Madera
           Avenue where bicycle lanes are narrow or unstriped.
General Plan                                                                         Corte Madera

PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION
Pedestrian movement through the Town occurs via a series of sidewalks on major streets.
As previously discussed, Highway 101 acts as a partial barrier to connectivity between the
east and west areas of the Town, with pedestrian access limited to the Tamalpais Drive
interchange, the Wornum Drive pedestrian undercrossing, and the overcrossing at the north
edge of Town on the Larkspur border. As discussed in Chapter 6 (Parks and Recreation),
the Town also has a number of unpaved hiking trails in its hillside areas, including in the
Ring Mountain, Chapman Hill and Christmas Tree Hill areas. The Town maintains portions
of the following trails (which include trails improved with stairways) through its Capital
Improvement Program budget:
    ♦ Hill Path                                 ♦ Short Path

         Implementation Program CIR-1.1.a:         Level of Service Standards
         The town shall strive to maintain Level of Service (LOS) D operation during the
         weekday morning and evening peak periods at intersections of an arterial street with
         either another arterial or a collector street and intersections of two collector streets.
         For projected future conditions the LOS is to be calculated using the average traffic
         demand over the highest 60-minute period. For all types of controls the Level of
         Service standard is to be applied to the average operation of the intersection, and not
         that for any single movement or approach. Exceptions to meeting this standard
         include:
         1) Stop-controlled minor street approaches to either collector or arterial streets, where
             safety shall be the primary consideration;
         2) Locations where the Town Engineer deems improvement to be technically,
             financially, or environmentally infeasible;
         3) Conditions where the improvement would result in significant adverse impacts to
             other travel modes, including walking, bicycling, or transit; or
         4) Locations where attainment would ensure the loss of an area’s unique character.

5.1         INTRODUCTION
The Community Design chapter addresses the desired
visual character of Corte Madera’s natural and built
environments. It provides an overview of the Town’s
existing design character and the regulatory framework
for managing community design. It examines community
design through residential, non-residential and
infrastructure issues, and provides a series of goals,
policies and implementation actions at the end of the
chapter.
EXISTING CHARACTER
Built Environment
The Town of Corte Madera has many unique residential areas (e.g. Christmas Tree Hill,
Mariner Cove, Chapman Hill, Madera Gardens). The Town provides a mixture of housing
types, styles and densities. While the majority of housing in Corte Madera was built in the
1950s and 1960s, some of the oldest homes were built in the late 1800s, and new homes
continue to be built today.
The Town offers shops and small businesses in the
historic Old Corte Madera Square, as well as regional,
upscale shopping at the Village of Corte Madera and
Corte Madera Town Center. Many of the Town’s streets
are wide and well landscaped, while streets in hillside
areas tend to be narrow and winding.
Natural Environment
The natural environment of Corte Madera is very diverse, ranging from flat wetlands at the
bayside to steep terrain on Chapman and Christmas Tree Hill. The natural environment
presents challenges when considering design approaches. Conditions such as floodplains
and steep topography dictate certain building options and site planning.
VISION FOR THE FUTURE
A Community Preferences Survey conducted in 2002 indicated that residents are generally
pleased with the existing characteristics of Town design.
Given that there are almost no remaining vacant areas within the Town that can support
development due to physical constraints, and that residents are content with the overall
existing design character, the focus of Community Design for the future emphasizes
opportunities for improvement and enhancement of existing conditions.

 5.2         REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
 CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
 The California Government Code does not require a Community Design Element as part of
 a municipality’s General Plan. However, the State’s General Plan Guidelines suggest that
 this Element may be useful in providing additional direction, beyond that of the Land Use
 Element, to the planning area’s development pattern. This direction can enhance the sense
 of place and quality of life in the planning area.
 TOWN OF CORTE MADERA HOUSING ELEMENT
 The Housing Element for the Town of Corte Madera was adopted in 2002, and is a legally
 mandated component of the General Plan. The Housing Element analyzes housing needs,
 constraints and opportunities within the Town.
 The Housing Element includes policies addressing design and neighborhood preservation.
 The Housing Element is bound separately from the remainder of the General Plan.
 TOWN OF CORTE MADERA ZONING ORDINANCE
 The most recent update of Town of Corte Madera Zoning Ordinance was adopted in 1994.
 The primary purpose of the Zoning Ordinance is to control and regulate land use in the
 Town and “to protect and promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience,
 prosperity and general welfare” Specific objectives of the 1994 Zoning Ordinance include:
     ♦ To provide a precise guide for the physical development of the Town.
     ♦ To ensure that uses and structures enhance their site and harmonize with the
         surrounding area.
     ♦ To ensure that the present, unique character of the Town’s different neighborhoods is
         protected and enhanced.
 Additionally, in 1994, the Town adopted abbreviated Design Review Guidelines in the
 Zoning Ordinance to guide the Planning Commission and Zoning Administrator in their
 analysis of development plans.

DESIGN REVIEW
The Town conducts two tiers of design review. The Zoning Administrator conducts minor
design review. If the project involves significant issues, the Planning Commission conducts
the design review. Design review projects are generally examined on a case-by-case basis,
with proposed design and setting among the issues considered in the design review process.
Affirmative findings must be made by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission
that the project is in scale and harmonious with the area and that the project will not
significantly or adversely affect the views, sunlight or privacy of nearby residences.
DESIGN GUIDELINES
The General Plan contains several policies requiring the Town to adopt and then apply a
complete set of Design Guidelines. These guidelines will provide design advice to property
owners and architects, as well as to Town staff and decision-makers when considering
development proposals.

 5.3 RESIDENTIAL DESIGN
 GUIDING PRINCIPLES
 With Corte Madera’s residential neighborhoods nearly built out, the focus in the coming
 years turns to improving the neighborhood character of these areas. Growing families and
 the expensive real estate market in Marin County add to ever increasing pressures to
 expand the size of existing homes and improve an aging housing stock. Proper design can
 enhance neighborhood character when new development is proposed on the few remaining
 vacant lots or when existing homes are expanded or otherwise remodeled. The evaluation
 and analysis of new or expansion projects must balance the needs of the home owner with
 potential neighborhood impacts affecting views, sunlight, privacy and safety. This balance
 must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The residential design Goals and Policies
 included in Section 5.6 reflect the guiding principles discussed below.
 Livability
 An attractive quality of life for the citizens of Corte Madera includes a scale and pattern of
 development that emphasizes “livability.” Characteristics of a livable community include
 visual interest, safety, resource efficiency, sense of place, neighborhood pride and

through improvements that physically connect residential neighborhoods to one another, to
schools, shopping and other community centers.
Strong Neighborhood Character
Residential design Goals and Policies emphasize maintenance and enhancement of the
Town’s many unique neighborhoods that range from bayfront water oriented areas to
grassy and wooded hillsides, while also recognizing the merits of allowing individual
design themes in new residential construction.
Designing with the Natural Landscape
To a large extent, neighborhood character in Corte Madera derives from the natural setting,
as seen in neighborhoods situated adjacent to the San Francisco Bay, the older residential
enclaves in and around Town Center, and the hillside neighborhoods in areas such as
Chapman and Christmas Tree Hill. The residential design Goals and Policies of the General
Plan provide for strengthening the visual and physical connection between the Town and its
surrounding landscape, including respect for natural landforms through appropriate site
planning.
View Preservation
Corte Madera has some of the most beautiful and captivating views of any Bay Area
community. With a backdrop of Mount Tamalpais to the west, with San Francisco Bay in
the foreground to the east, and with its rolling hills and natural ecological systems at
various points in-between, view preservation is a very important community amenity.
Views from residential properties add to property values and enhance quality of life. At the
same time, such viewsheds can also create conflict for owners seeking to develop their
properties, remodel or construct additions to their homes when construction may impact
views from nearby properties. This issue will be regulated with standards that allow for a
reasonable amount of development while minimizing significant negative impacts to
neighbor’s views. View issues tend to be linked to potential impacts on neighbor’s
expectation of privacy and access to sunlight. These issues must be balanced and evaluated
on a case-by-case basis when reviewing a development project.
Privacy Preservation/Sunlight Preservation
Owners seeking to develop their properties, remodel or construct additions to their homes
may impact the privacy and/or access to sunlight previously enjoyed by nearby neighbors.
During the development review process, these issues should be regulated with standards
that allow for a reasonable amount of development while minimizing or mitigating
significant or adverse privacy and/or sunlight impacts.

5.0 COMMUNITY DESIGN
 Flexibility
 The variation in topography, access, and styles in the existing built environment of Corte
 Madera calls for flexible design strategies. Residential design Goals and Policies therefore
 encourage design creativity to better reflect site planning opportunities and constraints.
 5.4          NON-RESIDENTIAL DESIGN
 While most of Corte Madera’s non-residential properties
 are already developed, potential remains for
 reconstructing underutilized sites or for new construction
 when land use changes are proposed.                  The non-
 residential Goals and Policies included in Section 5.6
 reflect the three guiding principles discussed below.
 GUIDING PRINCIPLES
 Mixed-Use Development and Multi-Use Structures
 Sustainability principles promote environmental, social and economic vitality. In keeping
 with the General Plan intent to build a strengthened sense of community and to implement
 sustainability concepts, the Town seeks to make commercial and office locations pedestrian-
 friendly and more than just places to live, shop or work.               Additionally, mixed-use
 development decreases dependence on the automobile.
 Emphasis on Scenic Attributes
 The town character and scenic views that Corte Madera is known for are as important to
 non-residential development as they are to residential development. Good, non-residential
 design can create active, visually interesting areas that invite pedestrian activity.
 Consequently, Goals and Policies for non-residential design deemphasize hardscape (areas
 devoid of natural vegetation), optimize connectivity to other areas, and promote visual
 interest, safety, social interaction, resource efficiency, and quality design.
 Flexibility
 The variety of landscapes and commercial development existing in Corte Madera
 necessitates flexible design standards, as well as definitive principles to promote good
 design. As such, non-residential Goals and Policies include flexibility in their direction and
 interpretation.
General Plan                                                                         Corte Madera
                                                                                        April 2009

KEY DESIGN ISSUES
The following points are addressed within the Goals and Policies (Section 5.6), and are
emphasized here because they are considered among the most pertinent issues facing Corte
Madera’s non-residential design.
Floor-Area Ratio
The 1989 General Plan prescribed a 0.34 maximum Floor-Area Ratio (FAR) for commercial
development. In preparing this General Plan update, the Town determined that a higher
FAR would be appropriate in some instances, particularly as a means of provided greater
design flexibility and as an improved opportunity for economic development and housing.
Connectivity
Overall, Corte Madera has well-designed neighborhoods and non-residential centers;
however, some parts of the Town are physically disconnected. This separation of uses is
convenient for vehicular circulation but discourages walking and bicycling.            Non-
residential development should provide pedestrian and bicycle pathways to improve
connectivity between land uses and as a means of reducing vehicular travel.
Mixed-Use
Mixed uses allow residential development in conjunction with commercial uses, to promote
efficient use of land resources, energy and materials, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods,
reduced traffic congestion and associated vehicle emissions, and compatibility with existing
community character.
5.5         INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN
In addition to the community design issues associated with residential and non-residential
construction, design policy should also encompass public utilities, streets, and other
infrastructure that affect the appearance of the community. The infrastructure design Goals
and Policies included in Section 5.6 reflect the following guiding principles.
Corte Madera                                                                    General Plan

5.0 COMMUNITY DESIGN
 GUIDING PRINCIPLES
 Design According to the Natural Setting
 Protecting and enhancing the community’s natural
 setting, as noted earlier in this chapter, is important to
 the Town. Infrastructure, such as roads, open storm
 drain channels and pump stations, should be designed
 to respect the surrounding natural landscape while
 achieving specific goals relative to provision of
 infrastructure improvements.
 KEY DESIGN ISSUES
 Linkages
 Public facilities, such as storm drainage channels, can be used to create green linkages that
 provide continuity and connection through the community. Green linkages can include
 paths, creek ways, and other linear open spaces, as well as habitat areas for water birds and
 other species.
 Scenic Corridors
 Certain roadways within Corte Madera will be developed as scenic corridors, including
 Tamalpais Drive, Paradise Drive, Corte Madera Avenue and San Clemente Drive, as a
 means of improving the visual quality of the community and creating attractive public
 places.
 Undergrounding
 Where possible, infrastructure and utilities can be placed underground to better preserve
 the natural landscape and views.

5.1         INTRODUCTION
The Community Design chapter addresses the desired
visual character of Corte Madera’s natural and built
environments. It provides an overview of the Town’s
existing design character and the regulatory framework
for managing community design. It examines community
design through residential, non-residential and
infrastructure issues, and provides a series of goals,
policies and implementation actions at the end of the
chapter.
EXISTING CHARACTER
Built Environment
The Town of Corte Madera has many unique residential areas (e.g. Christmas Tree Hill,
Mariner Cove, Chapman Hill, Madera Gardens). The Town provides a mixture of housing
types, styles and densities. While the majority of housing in Corte Madera was built in the
1950s and 1960s, some of the oldest homes were built in the late 1800s, and new homes
continue to be built today.
The Town offers shops and small businesses in the
historic Old Corte Madera Square, as well as regional,
upscale shopping at the Village of Corte Madera and
Corte Madera Town Center. Many of the Town’s streets
are wide and well landscaped, while streets in hillside
areas tend to be narrow and winding.
Natural Environment
The natural environment of Corte Madera is very diverse, ranging from flat wetlands at the
bayside to steep terrain on Chapman and Christmas Tree Hill. The natural environment
presents challenges when considering design approaches. Conditions such as floodplains
and steep topography dictate certain building options and site planning.
VISION FOR THE FUTURE
A Community Preferences Survey conducted in 2002 indicated that residents are generally
pleased with the existing characteristics of Town design.
Given that there are almost no remaining vacant areas within the Town that can support
development due to physical constraints, and that residents are content with the overall
existing design character, the focus of Community Design for the future emphasizes
opportunities for improvement and enhancement of existing conditions.

 5.2         REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
 CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
 The California Government Code does not require a Community Design Element as part of
 a municipality’s General Plan. However, the State’s General Plan Guidelines suggest that
 this Element may be useful in providing additional direction, beyond that of the Land Use
 Element, to the planning area’s development pattern. This direction can enhance the sense
 of place and quality of life in the planning area.
 TOWN OF CORTE MADERA HOUSING ELEMENT
 The Housing Element for the Town of Corte Madera was adopted in 2002, and is a legally
 mandated component of the General Plan. The Housing Element analyzes housing needs,
 constraints and opportunities within the Town.
 The Housing Element includes policies addressing design and neighborhood preservation.
 The Housing Element is bound separately from the remainder of the General Plan.
 TOWN OF CORTE MADERA ZONING ORDINANCE
 The most recent update of Town of Corte Madera Zoning Ordinance was adopted in 1994.
 The primary purpose of the Zoning Ordinance is to control and regulate land use in the
 Town and “to protect and promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience,
 prosperity and general welfare” Specific objectives of the 1994 Zoning Ordinance include:
     ♦ To provide a precise guide for the physical development of the Town.
     ♦ To ensure that uses and structures enhance their site and harmonize with the
         surrounding area.
     ♦ To ensure that the present, unique character of the Town’s different neighborhoods is
         protected and enhanced.
 Additionally, in 1994, the Town adopted abbreviated Design Review Guidelines in the
 Zoning Ordinance to guide the Planning Commission and Zoning Administrator in their
 analysis of development plans.

DESIGN REVIEW
The Town conducts two tiers of design review. The Zoning Administrator conducts minor
design review. If the project involves significant issues, the Planning Commission conducts
the design review. Design review projects are generally examined on a case-by-case basis,
with proposed design and setting among the issues considered in the design review process.
Affirmative findings must be made by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission
that the project is in scale and harmonious with the area and that the project will not
significantly or adversely affect the views, sunlight or privacy of nearby residences.
DESIGN GUIDELINES
The General Plan contains several policies requiring the Town to adopt and then apply a
complete set of Design Guidelines. These guidelines will provide design advice to property
owners and architects, as well as to Town staff and decision-makers when considering
development proposals.

 5.3 RESIDENTIAL DESIGN
 GUIDING PRINCIPLES
 With Corte Madera’s residential neighborhoods nearly built out, the focus in the coming
 years turns to improving the neighborhood character of these areas. Growing families and
 the expensive real estate market in Marin County add to ever increasing pressures to
 expand the size of existing homes and improve an aging housing stock. Proper design can
 enhance neighborhood character when new development is proposed on the few remaining
 vacant lots or when existing homes are expanded or otherwise remodeled. The evaluation
 and analysis of new or expansion projects must balance the needs of the home owner with
 potential neighborhood impacts affecting views, sunlight, privacy and safety. This balance
 must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The residential design Goals and Policies
 included in Section 5.6 reflect the guiding principles discussed below.
 Livability
 An attractive quality of life for the citizens of Corte Madera includes a scale and pattern of
 development that emphasizes “livability.” Characteristics of a livable community include
 visual interest, safety, resource efficiency, sense of place, neighborhood pride and
 ownership, and recognition of changing economic trends such as Home Occupations, and
 connectivity. Residential design Goals and Policies emphasize community-building
General Plan                                                                              Corte Madera

through improvements that physically connect residential neighborhoods to one another, to
schools, shopping and other community centers.
Strong Neighborhood Character
Residential design Goals and Policies emphasize maintenance and enhancement of the
Town’s many unique neighborhoods that range from bayfront water oriented areas to
grassy and wooded hillsides, while also recognizing the merits of allowing individual
design themes in new residential construction.
Designing with the Natural Landscape
To a large extent, neighborhood character in Corte Madera derives from the natural setting,
as seen in neighborhoods situated adjacent to the San Francisco Bay, the older residential
enclaves in and around Town Center, and the hillside neighborhoods in areas such as
Chapman and Christmas Tree Hill. The residential design Goals and Policies of the General
Plan provide for strengthening the visual and physical connection between the Town and its
surrounding landscape, including respect for natural landforms through appropriate site
planning.
View Preservation
Corte Madera has some of the most beautiful and captivating views of any Bay Area
community. With a backdrop of Mount Tamalpais to the west, with San Francisco Bay in
the foreground to the east, and with its rolling hills and natural ecological systems at
various points in-between, view preservation is a very important community amenity.
Views from residential properties add to property values and enhance quality of life. At the
same time, such viewsheds can also create conflict for owners seeking to develop their
properties, remodel or construct additions to their homes when construction may impact
views from nearby properties. This issue will be regulated with standards that allow for a
reasonable amount of development while minimizing significant negative impacts to
neighbor’s views. View issues tend to be linked to potential impacts on neighbor’s
expectation of privacy and access to sunlight. These issues must be balanced and evaluated
on a case-by-case basis when reviewing a development project.
Privacy Preservation/Sunlight Preservation
Owners seeking to develop their properties, remodel or construct additions to their homes
may impact the privacy and/or access to sunlight previously enjoyed by nearby neighbors.
During the development review process, these issues should be regulated with standards
that allow for a reasonable amount of development while minimizing or mitigating
significant or adverse privacy and/or sunlight impacts.

5.0 COMMUNITY DESIGN
 Flexibility
 The variation in topography, access, and styles in the existing built environment of Corte
 Madera calls for flexible design strategies. Residential design Goals and Policies therefore
 encourage design creativity to better reflect site planning opportunities and constraints.
 5.4          NON-RESIDENTIAL DESIGN
 While most of Corte Madera’s non-residential properties
 are already developed, potential remains for
 reconstructing underutilized sites or for new construction
 when land use changes are proposed.                  The non-
 residential Goals and Policies included in Section 5.6
 reflect the three guiding principles discussed below.
 GUIDING PRINCIPLES
 Mixed-Use Development and Multi-Use Structures
 Sustainability principles promote environmental, social and economic vitality. In keeping
 with the General Plan intent to build a strengthened sense of community and to implement
 sustainability concepts, the Town seeks to make commercial and office locations pedestrian-
 friendly and more than just places to live, shop or work.               Additionally, mixed-use
 development decreases dependence on the automobile.
 Emphasis on Scenic Attributes
 The town character and scenic views that Corte Madera is known for are as important to
 non-residential development as they are to residential development. Good, non-residential
 design can create active, visually interesting areas that invite pedestrian activity.
 Consequently, Goals and Policies for non-residential design deemphasize hardscape (areas
 devoid of natural vegetation), optimize connectivity to other areas, and promote visual
 interest, safety, social interaction, resource efficiency, and quality design.
 Flexibility
 The variety of landscapes and commercial development existing in Corte Madera
 necessitates flexible design standards, as well as definitive principles to promote good
 design. As such, non-residential Goals and Policies include flexibility in their direction and
 interpretation.
General Plan                                                                         Corte Madera

KEY DESIGN ISSUES
The following points are addressed within the Goals and Policies (Section 5.6), and are
emphasized here because they are considered among the most pertinent issues facing Corte
Madera’s non-residential design.
Floor-Area Ratio
The 1989 General Plan prescribed a 0.34 maximum Floor-Area Ratio (FAR) for commercial
development. In preparing this General Plan update, the Town determined that a higher
FAR would be appropriate in some instances, particularly as a means of provided greater
design flexibility and as an improved opportunity for economic development and housing.
Connectivity
Overall, Corte Madera has well-designed neighborhoods and non-residential centers;
however, some parts of the Town are physically disconnected. This separation of uses is
convenient for vehicular circulation but discourages walking and bicycling.            Non-
residential development should provide pedestrian and bicycle pathways to improve
connectivity between land uses and as a means of reducing vehicular travel.
Mixed-Use
Mixed uses allow residential development in conjunction with commercial uses, to promote
efficient use of land resources, energy and materials, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods,
reduced traffic congestion and associated vehicle emissions, and compatibility with existing
community character.
5.5         INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN
In addition to the community design issues associated with residential and non-residential
construction, design policy should also encompass public utilities, streets, and other
infrastructure that affect the appearance of the community. The infrastructure design Goals
and Policies included in Section 5.6 reflect the following guiding principles.
Corte Madera                                                                    General Plan

5.0 COMMUNITY DESIGN
 GUIDING PRINCIPLES
 Design According to the Natural Setting
 Protecting and enhancing the community’s natural
 setting, as noted earlier in this chapter, is important to
 the Town. Infrastructure, such as roads, open storm
 drain channels and pump stations, should be designed
 to respect the surrounding natural landscape while
 achieving specific goals relative to provision of
 infrastructure improvements.
 KEY DESIGN ISSUES
 Linkages
 Public facilities, such as storm drainage channels, can be used to create green linkages that
 provide continuity and connection through the community. Green linkages can include
 paths, creek ways, and other linear open spaces, as well as habitat areas for water birds and

July 2002, indicated a strong desire for new and improved recreational facilities, including
recreational programs and facilities specifically for teens, and new and improved bicycle
and pedestrian paths. Other interests included developing specialized areas, such as dog
parks and skate parks.
The Town’s Recreation and Leisure Services Department offers a wide range of programs
for Town residents. However, Recreation Center facilities are too small to meet community
needs. Additionally, the General Plan Steering Committee identified the need for a
Community Center, perhaps in conjunction with an expanded Recreation Center, to serve
the entire community.
6.2         REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
State law and policies require the Open Space Element of the General Plan to promote the
retention of open space for recreational purposes. California Government Code §65560(b)
defines “open space land” as any parcel or area of land or water that is unimproved and
devoted to an open space use. State law requires cities and counties to prepare and carry out
open-space plans that will, in conjunction with state and regional plans, accomplish “long-

6.0 PARKS AND RECREATION
 range preservation and conservation of open-space land within its jurisdiction.”
 The law provides for the preservation of open-space lands for a variety of uses, including
 outdoor recreation. The intent of the law is to protect the public interest in open-space land,
 and to recognize it as a limited and valuable resource that must be conserved wherever
 possible. Open-space plans must also contain specific implementation programs.
 QUIMBY ACT
 The Quimby Act, Government Code §66477, allows cities and counties to adopt ordinances
 requiring the dedication of parkland, fees in lieu of, or a combination of both to be used only
 for the purpose of acquiring land for park purposes. The Act provides for the conditioning
 of new development at the tentative map stage to dedicate unimproved parkland at the
 minimum standard of three acres per 1,000 residents to a maximum of five acres per 1,000
 residents. The parkland and/or in lieu fees are to be used for new or existing neighborhood
 or community parks or recreational facilities to serve the subdivision.
 1989 TOWN GENERAL PLAN AND MUNICIPAL CODE STANDARDS
 The 1989 General Plan (Policy 2.8.e) retained the standard set in the 1978 General Plan of 5.0
 acres of park land per 1,000 residents. Corte Madera has a total of 35.8 acres of parkland.
 This equates to a ratio of approximately 3.9 acres of parkland per 1,000 Town residents. The
 1989 General Plan emphasized retention and upgrading of existing park facilities, with the
 5.0 acres of park land per 1,000 residents as a goal in the event additional parklands became
 available. This standard does not include regional open space lands, both in the Town and
 adjacent to it.
 The Corte Madera Municipal Code (Section 17.30.020) currently utilizes a standard of 4.0
 acres per 1,000 residents, which is applicable to subdivisions of 50 units or more. Municipal
 Code standards for provision of parkland must be consistent with those in the General Plan.
 NATIONAL RECREATION AND PARKS ASSOCIATION
 Recreational lands differ from other open space lands in that they allow a greater range of
 public access and direct recreational uses. Recreational lands vary by size, use, and facilities.
 The National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) has developed definitions for types
 of recreational facilities:
 Mini-park: A specialized facility that serves a concentrated or limited population or specific
 group such as tots or senior citizens. This facility should be located within neighborhoods
 and in close proximity to apartment complexes, townhouse developments, or housing for
 the elderly.

Neighborhood park: An area for intense recreational activities such as field games, court
games, crafts, playground apparatus, skating, picnicking, wading pools, etc. Neighborhood
park sites should be suited for intense development, easily accessible to neighborhood
populations, and geographically located for safe walking and bicycle access.
Community park: An area of diverse recreational value including intense recreational
facilities such as athletic complexes and pools, as well as more passive uses such as
picnicking, viewing, nature study, and other types of recreational development.
Regional park/Park preserve: An area of natural or ornamental quality for outdoor recreation
such as picnicking, boating, fishing, swimming, camping and trail uses, with much of the
land reserved for conservation and natural resource management.
The NRPA also describes other types of recreational facilities such as “linear parks” for
hiking, bicycling, and equestrian activities; “special use” areas for golf, gardening, and
outdoor theatres; and “conservancies” designated for the protection and management of
natural or cultural resources. The NRPA has established guidelines for the amount of
recreational land necessary to serve a given population, however, these guidelines are
oriented toward more metropolitan areas. Therefore, the NRPA advises each jurisdiction to
establish its own standards that are tailored to the unique characteristics of the area.
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA)
The Parks and Recreation Element addresses facilities that are typically subject to the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Due to the public nature of park and recreation
facilities, it is critical that the Town include accommodations that promote access for
persons with limited mobility. The Corte Madera Town Council has stated its commitment
to implementing the intent and spirit of the ADA, and the Town recently adopted a
Transition Plan to implement provisions of the Act.
The individual General Plan elements must be consistent with each other. Internal
consistency within the Parks and Recreation Element will be maintained with the Land Use
Element (designation of lands for park and recreation uses), and the Circulation Element
(movement through the community, including bicycle and pedestrian circulation).

 6.3         PARKS AND PARK FACILITIES
 The Town of Corte Madera maintains neighborhood and community parks varying in size,
 and distributed throughout the community (see Figure 6.1). Most of the parks in Town are
 located within walking or biking distance of residential neighborhoods, with the exception
 of residential areas on the higher elevations of Christmas Tree Hill.
 Neighborhood parks generally abut residential areas and include play areas, picnic areas,
 gathering areas, and open turf suitable for informal play, practices, or scrimmages.
 Community parks are generally designed to serve the needs of several neighborhoods or the
 whole community.
 The Town has seven neighborhood and community parks:
         ♦ Town Park is the community’s centerpiece with approximately 22 acres on
             Tamalpais Drive. This extensive park contains numerous picnic areas with
             barbecues, softball and soccer fields, tennis courts, a basketball court, skate park, and
             playground equipment at various locations, with restrooms and parking. Most of the
             park is owned by the Town. The Larkspur School District owns a portion of the
             playfields, which are operated under a joint-use agreement. Town Park is host to the
             Town’s Recreation Center.
         ♦ San Clemente Park is an 8.5-acre park with a softball field, picnic area, volleyball
             area, restroom and parking lot. The park site is located east of Highway 101 just
             south of San Clemente Creek and owned by the Larkspur School District. A joint use
             agreement with the Town expires in 2017.
         ♦ Granada Park is a 0.5-acre park with a tennis court, picnic area, and parking area
             owned by the Reed School District and located in the southeastern portion of town.
             A joint-use agreement with the Town expires in 2005, but is expected to continue.
         ♦ Skunk Hollow Mini-Park is a 0.25-acre playground and picnic area located on the
             east side of Town. Parking is on-street. The park is Town-owned.
         ♦ Menke Park is a 1.0-acre park with a picnic area, bandstand/pavilion, and parking
             lot on the west side of Town in Old Corte Madera Square. The Town owns the old
             railroad right-of-way traversing the site (estimated at 5% of the entire park areas), as
             well as the remainder of the site, and conducts all park maintenance operations.
         ♦ Bayside Trail Park is a 2.75-acre linear park located on San Clemente Drive. A 0.5-
             mile long trail traverses the park. The Town owns the park.
         ♦ Higgins Landing is a .55 - acre Town-owned boathouse and dock located on the
             north edge of Town by Corte Madera Creek.

San Clemente Park, Granada Park, Menke Park, Bayside Trail Park and portions of Town
Park have been developed and maintained under joint-use agreements with the Larkspur
and Reed School Districts. These joint-use agreements detail how the joint-use will be
funded, developed, and maintained. Park/School project agreements generally hold the
Town responsible for improvements and cost of maintenance operations, while the School
District provides land.
Other joint-use agreements include the use of the Neil Cummins school gymnasium, San
Clemente School multi-use room and Redwood High School roller hockey rink. Neil
Cummins and San Clemente Schools are under the Larkspur School District, while
Redwood High School is under the Tamalpais Union High School District. The Town has
joint-use agreements with both Districts and is responsible for insurance, utilities, and
maintenance operations.
Town recreation facilities include the Recreation Center in Town Park. Built in 1953, the
Center includes approximately 10,000 square feet of space housing a main hall, kitchen,
classrooms, patio and offices. Other facilities included space a Youth Center, which was
recently closed, causing relocation of classes and events to other locations. The Town has
arrangements to use other facilities in the area, including the swimming pools at Redwood
High School and the College of Marin, dance academy, and local businesses and churches.
6.4         RECREATIONAL OPEN SPACES
The extensive array of regional open space lands in and adjacent to the Town, combined
with marsh and wetland sites along the Bay frontage, add to the availability of recreational
open space in Corte Madera.
The Marin County Open Space District was established
in 1972 for the acquisition and management of open
space lands, with operations funded through an ongoing
property tax. These lands provide open space and
community separators in the urban corridor of Marin
County, as well as passive recreational opportunities for
Corte Madera residents. These preserves are open to the
public for hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking,
picnicking, bird watching and fishing. Open space areas
also create a green infrastructure and provide relief from
urban development. Acquiring and managing open space protects natural resources
through environmental stewardship.
There are five Open Space Preserves in and adjacent to the Town of Corte Madera, shown
on Figure 6.1:
        ♦ Blithedale Summit Preserve, located just outside the western border of Town,
            and accessed through hiking trails in the Christmas Tree Hill area below.

         ♦ Camino Alto Preserve, located on the western edge of Town.
         ♦ Alto Bowl Preserve, located just outside the southwestern border of Town.
         ♦ Tiburon Ridge Preserve, located in the southern portion of Town.
         ♦ Ring Mountain Preserve, located in the southeastern portion of Town and accessed
             along the Paradise Drive frontage.
 These preserves cover approximately 200 acres in the Town limits.
 In addition to open space preserves, marshes and wetlands in the Town enhance
 recreational values as open space and wildlife sanctuaries that provide important habitat for
 plant and wildlife. These areas include mudflats, tidal salt marshes, diked marshlands,
 associated uplands and freshwater marshes. As part of the San Francisco Bay wetlands
 system, Corte Madera marshes provide important habitat for many birds, as well as expand
 the Town’s recreational opportunities for passive recreational activities.
 There are several marsh areas along Corte Madera’s Bay front, shown on Figure 6.1:
         ♦ Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve is the largest holding of marshlands in Corte
             Madera, consisting of over 200 acres. This area has been fully restored as a tidal
             wetland as mitigation for the dredging and filling associated with the operations of
             the Larkspur Ferry. It includes hiking trails and wildlife observation areas.
         ♦ Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District Site is a 72-acre site
             surrounded on three sides by the Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve, with
             approximately half the site classified as a seasonal wetland. The site includes trail
             access along the Old Northwestern Pacific Railroad right-of-way.
         ♦ Madera Bay Park Site/Shorebird Marsh and the Habitat Site are marsh and upland
             sites located north of The Village Shopping Center. They provide access to the marsh
             areas from the shopping center parking areas and from Paradise Drive.
         ♦ Triangle Marsh is a tidal mudflat and salt marsh, which is privately owned, but
             includes access points for wildlife viewing from Paradise Drive and Cay Passage.
 Collectively, these marshland areas total in excess of 300 acres, and when combined with
 open space preserves of the Marin County Open Space District, total approximately 500
 acres.
 6.5         TRAILS
 Largely known only to local residents, Corte Madera’s residential hillsides are host to
 staircases and earth trails that climb the Chapman and Christmas Tree Hill areas. These
 trails provide an important link between residential streets and allow local residents

pedestrian access to Old Corte Madera Square, Town Hall and Town Park. These trails also
provide convenient points of access to regional open space and hiking areas such as the
Blithedale Summit, Baltimore Canyon, and Camino Alto Open Space Preserves, and serve as
gateways for the energetic hiker heading toward open space lands in the Marin Municipal
Water District or Mt. Tamalpais State Park. The trails also serve as alternative emergency
evacuation routes and support public utilities, such as water distribution and storm water
drainage collection.
Most of the trails in the Christmas Tree Hill area are the result of
easements created through subdivisions decades ago, which
were intended to interconnect the narrow and winding streets
by trails and paths. Up to 36 easements were shown in the
original Christmas Tree Hill subdivisions. Today, some of the
trails are still privately owned and maintained, and in some
instances, are partially contained within fenced yards. Portions
of the easements are overgrown and neglected with no evidence
of an existing trail. Other segments of these easements have
been dedicated to the Town by adjoining property owners and
are currently used by the community.
The Town maintains some of these trails as part of the Capital
Improvement Program budget. On-street parking near the trails
is limited, and for this reason the trails are used mostly by
neighborhood residents.
Of note is the planned completion of the San Francisco Bay Trail, a multi-jurisdictional and
agency effort headed by the Association of Bay Area Governments to provide a continuous
bicycle and pedestrian trail around the San Francisco and San Pablo Bays. In Corte Madera,
the Bay Trail would likely follow Paradise Drive, sharing the existing bicycle route, San
Clemente Drive, and Redwood Highway or the former Northwestern Pacific Railroad right-
of-way by the Bay frontage.
Key trail locations are shown on the Pedestrian and Bicycle Lanes map (Figure 4.2).
6.6         RECREATION PROGRAMMING
The Corte Madera Parks and Recreation Department manages park and recreation facilities.
Department duties include acquisition, development and implementation of park and
recreation policies and programs.
Recreational programs are varied, including self-facilitated services such as senior activities,
after-school programs for youth, pre-school programs, teen programs, summer camps,
nature and outdoor programs, health and wellness classes, sports leagues and sports
instruction, youth sports coaches and training, art and dance programs, multicultural
events, and emergency preparedness and support.

6.0 PARKS AND RECREATIO

                                                  6.0 PARKS AND RECREATION
6.1         INTRODUCTION
Corte Madera offers a combination of regional parklands and Town parks, as well as a
range of recreation and leisure programs for its residents. Marin County’s extensive open
space lands and preserves system provides Town residents with an array of recreational
opportunities, which is complemented by Town-owned and maintained neighborhood
parks.
In addition to Corte Madera’s expansive medley of
outdoor trails, recreational facilities include a gymnasium,
play equipment, soccer fields, softball fields, picnic areas,
and tennis, basketball, roller hockey and volleyball courts.
The Town’s parks, recreation facilities and programs
strengthen community image, create a sense of place, and
promote residents’ health and well-being.
The Parks and Recreation Element provides the policy-
level foundation for maintaining and enhancing the Town’s existing programs and facilities,
preserving open space areas, and planning for the expansion of Town-wide trails. Providing
recreational opportunities at all levels is a key component for quality of life in Corte
Madera.
Acquiring new lands and expanding facilities is essential for improving the Town’s
programs and parks. A Community Preferences Survey, distributed to Town residents in
July 2002, indicated a strong desire for new and improved recreational facilities, including
recreational programs and facilities specifically for teens, and new and improved bicycle
and pedestrian paths. Other interests included developing specialized areas, such as dog
parks and skate parks.
The Town’s Recreation and Leisure Services Department offers a wide range of programs
for Town residents. However, Recreation Center facilities are too small to meet community
needs. Additionally, the General Plan Steering Committee identified the need for a
Community Center, perhaps in conjunction with an expanded Recreation Center, to serve
the entire community.
6.2         REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
State law and policies require the Open Space Element of the General Plan to promote the
retention of open space for recreational purposes. California Government Code §65560(b)
defines “open space land” as any parcel or area of land or water that is unimproved and
devoted to an open space use. State law requires cities and counties to prepare and carry out
open-space plans that will, in conjunction with state and regional plans, accomplish “long-
Corte Madera                                                                      General Plan

                                                 6-1

6.0 PARKS AND RECREATION
 range preservation and conservation of open-space land within its jurisdiction.”
 The law provides for the preservation of open-space lands for a variety of uses, including
 outdoor recreation. The intent of the law is to protect the public interest in open-space land,
 and to recognize it as a limited and valuable resource that must be conserved wherever
 possible. Open-space plans must also contain specific implementation programs.
 QUIMBY ACT
 The Quimby Act, Government Code §66477, allows cities and counties to adopt ordinances
 requiring the dedication of parkland, fees in lieu of, or a combination of both to be used only
 for the purpose of acquiring land for park purposes. The Act provides for the conditioning
 of new development at the tentative map stage to dedicate unimproved parkland at the
 minimum standard of three acres per 1,000 residents to a maximum of five acres per 1,000
 residents. The parkland and/or in lieu fees are to be used for new or existing neighborhood
 or community parks or recreational facilities to serve the subdivision.
 1989 TOWN GENERAL PLAN AND MUNICIPAL CODE STANDARDS
 The 1989 General Plan (Policy 2.8.e) retained the standard set in the 1978 General Plan of 5.0
 acres of park land per 1,000 residents. Corte Madera has a total of 35.8 acres of parkland.
 This equates to a ratio of approximately 3.9 acres of parkland per 1,000 Town residents. The
 1989 General Plan emphasized retention and upgrading of existing park facilities, with the
 5.0 acres of park land per 1,000 residents as a goal in the event additional parklands became
 available. This standard does not include regional open space lands, both in the Town and
 adjacent to it.
 The Corte Madera Municipal Code (Section 17.30.020) currently utilizes a standard of 4.0
 acres per 1,000 residents, which is applicable to subdivisions of 50 units or more. Municipal
 Code standards for provision of parkland must be consistent with those in the General Plan.
 NATIONAL RECREATION AND PARKS ASSOCIATION
 Recreational lands differ from other open space lands in that they allow a greater range of
 public access and direct recreational uses. Recreational lands vary by size, use, and facilities.
 The National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) has developed definitions for types
 of recreational facilities:
 Mini-park: A specialized facility that serves a concentrated or limited population or specific
 group such as tots or senior citizens. This facility should be located within neighborhoods
 and in close proximity to apartment complexes, townhouse developments, or housing for
 the elderly.

                                                                                        April 2009

Neighborhood park: An area for intense recreational activities such as field games, court
games, crafts, playground apparatus, skating, picnicking, wading pools, etc. Neighborhood
park sites should be suited for intense development, easily accessible to neighborhood
populations, and geographically located for safe walking and bicycle access.
Community park: An area of diverse recreational value including intense recreational
facilities such as athletic complexes and pools, as well as more passive uses such as
picnicking, viewing, nature study, and other types of recreational development.
Regional park/Park preserve: An area of natural or ornamental quality for outdoor recreation
such as picnicking, boating, fishing, swimming, camping and trail uses, with much of the
land reserved for conservation and natural resource management.
The NRPA also describes other types of recreational facilities such as “linear parks” for
hiking, bicycling, and equestrian activities; “special use” areas for golf, gardening, and
outdoor theatres; and “conservancies” designated for the protection and management of
natural or cultural resources. The NRPA has established guidelines for the amount of
recreational land necessary to serve a given population, however, these guidelines are
oriented toward more metropolitan areas. Therefore, the NRPA advises each jurisdiction to
establish its own standards that are tailored to the unique characteristics of the area.
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA)
The Parks and Recreation Element addresses facilities that are typically subject to the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Due to the public nature of park and recreation
facilities, it is critical that the Town include accommodations that promote access for
persons with limited mobility. The Corte Madera Town Council has stated its commitment
to implementing the intent and spirit of the ADA, and the Town recently adopted a
Transition Plan to implement provisions of the Act.
The individual General Plan elements must be consistent with each other. Internal
consistency within the Parks and Recreation Element will be maintained with the Land Use
Element (designation of lands for park and recreation uses), and the Circulation Element
(movement through the community, including bicycle and pedestrian circulation).

 6.3         PARKS AND PARK FACILITIES
 The Town of Corte Madera maintains neighborhood and community parks varying in size,
 and distributed throughout the community (see Figure 6.1). Most of the parks in Town are
 located within walking or biking distance of residential neighborhoods, with the exception
 of residential areas on the higher elevations of Christmas Tree Hill.
 Neighborhood parks generally abut residential areas and include play areas, picnic areas,
 gathering areas, and open turf suitable for informal play, practices, or scrimmages.
 Community parks are generally designed to serve the needs of several neighborhoods or the
 whole community.
 The Town has seven neighborhood and community parks:
         ♦ Town Park is the community’s centerpiece with approximately 22 acres on
             Tamalpais Drive. This extensive park contains numerous picnic areas with
             barbecues, softball and soccer fields, tennis courts, a basketball court, skate park, and
             playground equipment at various locations, with restrooms and parking. Most of the
             park is owned by the Town. The Larkspur School District owns a portion of the
             playfields, which are operated under a joint-use agreement. Town Park is host to the
             Town’s Recreation Center.
         ♦ San Clemente Park is an 8.5-acre park with a softball field, picnic area, volleyball
             area, restroom and parking lot. The park site is located east of Highway 101 just
             south of San Clemente Creek and owned by the Larkspur School District. A joint use
             agreement with the Town expires in 2017.
         ♦ Granada Park is a 0.5-acre park with a tennis court, picnic area, and parking area
             owned by the Reed School District and located in the southeastern portion of town.
             A joint-use agreement with the Town expires in 2005, but is expected to continue.
         ♦ Skunk Hollow Mini-Park is a 0.25-acre playground and picnic area located on the
             east side of Town. Parking is on-street. The park is Town-owned.
         ♦ Menke Park is a 1.0-acre park with a picnic area, bandstand/pavilion, and parking
             lot on the west side of Town in Old Corte Madera Square. The Town owns the old
             railroad right-of-way traversing the site (estimated at 5% of the entire park areas), as
             well as the remainder of the site, and conducts all park maintenance operations.
         ♦ Bayside Trail Park is a 2.75-acre linear park located on San Clemente Drive. A 0.5-
             mile long trail traverses the park. The Town owns the park.
         ♦ Higgins Landing is a .55 - acre Town-owned boathouse and dock located on the
             north edge of Town by Corte Madera Creek.

San Clemente Park, Granada Park, Menke Park, Bayside Trail Park and portions of Town
Park have been developed and maintained under joint-use agreements with the Larkspur
and Reed School Districts. These joint-use agreements detail how the joint-use will be
funded, developed, and maintained. Park/School project agreements generally hold the
Town responsible for improvements and cost of maintenance operations, while the School
District provides land.
Other joint-use agreements include the use of the Neil Cummins school gymnasium, San
Clemente School multi-use room and Redwood High School roller hockey rink. Neil
Cummins and San Clemente Schools are under the Larkspur School District, while
Redwood High School is under the Tamalpais Union High School District. The Town has
joint-use agreements with both Districts and is responsible for insurance, utilities, and
maintenance operations.
Town recreation facilities include the Recreation Center in Town Park. Built in 1953, the
Center includes approximately 10,000 square feet of space housing a main hall, kitchen,
classrooms, patio and offices. Other facilities included space a Youth Center, which was
recently closed, causing relocation of classes and events to other locations. The Town has
arrangements to use other facilities in the area, including the swimming pools at Redwood
High School and the College of Marin, dance academy, and local businesses and churches.
6.4         RECREATIONAL OPEN SPACES
The extensive array of regional open space lands in and adjacent to the Town, combined
with marsh and wetland sites along the Bay frontage, add to the availability of recreational
open space in Corte Madera.
The Marin County Open Space District was established
in 1972 for the acquisition and management of open
space lands, with operations funded through an ongoing
property tax. These lands provide open space and
community separators in the urban corridor of Marin
County, as well as passive recreational opportunities for
Corte Madera residents. These preserves are open to the
public for hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking,
picnicking, bird watching and fishing. Open space areas
also create a green infrastructure and provide relief from
urban development. Acquiring and managing open space protects natural resources
through environmental stewardship.
There are five Open Space Preserves in and adjacent to the Town of Corte Madera, shown
on Figure 6.1:
        ♦ Blithedale Summit Preserve, located just outside the western border of Town,
            and accessed through hiking trails in the Christmas Tree Hill area below.
Corte Madera                                                                       General Plan

         ♦ Camino Alto Preserve, located on the western edge of Town.
         ♦ Alto Bowl Preserve, located just outside the southwestern border of Town.
         ♦ Tiburon Ridge Preserve, located in the southern portion of Town.
         ♦ Ring Mountain Preserve, located in the southeastern portion of Town and accessed
             along the Paradise Drive frontage.
 These preserves cover approximately 200 acres in the Town limits.
 In addition to open space preserves, marshes and wetlands in the Town enhance
 recreational values as open space and wildlife sanctuaries that provide important habitat for
 plant and wildlife. These areas include mudflats, tidal salt marshes, diked marshlands,
 associated uplands and freshwater marshes. As part of the San Francisco Bay wetlands
 system, Corte Madera marshes provide important habitat for many birds, as well as expand
 the Town’s recreational opportunities for passive recreational activities.
 There are several marsh areas along Corte Madera’s Bay front, shown on Figure 6.1:
         ♦ Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve is the largest holding of marshlands in Corte
             Madera, consisting of over 200 acres. This area has been fully restored as a tidal
             wetland as mitigation for the dredging and filling associated with the operations of
             the Larkspur Ferry. It includes hiking trails and wildlife observation areas.
         ♦ Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District Site is a 72-acre site
             surrounded on three sides by the Corte Madera State Ecological Reserve, with
             approximately half the site classified as a seasonal wetland. The site includes trail
             access along the Old Northwestern Pacific Railroad right-of-way.
         ♦ Madera Bay Park Site/Shorebird Marsh and the Habitat Site are marsh and upland
             sites located north of The Village Shopping Center. They provide access to the marsh
             areas from the shopping center parking areas and from Paradise Drive.
         ♦ Triangle Marsh is a tidal mudflat and salt marsh, which is privately owned, but
             includes access points for wildlife viewing from Paradise Drive and Cay Passage.
 Collectively, these marshland areas total in excess of 300 acres, and when combined with
 open space preserves of the Marin County Open Space District, total approximately 500
 acres.
 6.5         TRAILS
 Largely known only to local residents, Corte Madera’s residential hillsides are host to
 staircases and earth trails that climb the Chapman and Christmas Tree Hill areas. These
 trails provide an important link between residential streets and allow local residents

pedestrian access to Old Corte Madera Square, Town Hall and Town Park. These trails also
provide convenient points of access to regional open space and hiking areas such as the
Blithedale Summit, Baltimore Canyon, and Camino Alto Open Space Preserves, and serve as
gateways for the energetic hiker heading toward open space lands in the Marin Municipal
Water District or Mt. Tamalpais State Park. The trails also serve as alternative emergency
evacuation routes and support public utilities, such as water distribution and storm water
drainage collection.
Most of the trails in the Christmas Tree Hill area are the result of
easements created through subdivisions decades ago, which
were intended to interconnect the narrow and winding streets
by trails and paths. Up to 36 easements were shown in the
original Christmas Tree Hill subdivisions. Today, some of the
trails are still privately owned and maintained, and in some
instances, are partially contained within fenced yards. Portions
of the easements are overgrown and neglected with no evidence
of an existing trail. Other segments of these easements have
been dedicated to the Town by adjoining property owners and
are currently used by the community.
The Town maintains some of these trails as part of the Capital
Improvement Program budget. On-street parking near the trails
is limited, and for this reason the trails are used mostly by
neighborhood residents.
Of note is the planned completion of the San Francisco Bay Trail, a multi-jurisdictional and
agency effort headed by the Association of Bay Area Governments to provide a continuous
bicycle and pedestrian trail around the San Francisco and San Pablo Bays. In Corte Madera,
the Bay Trail would likely follow Paradise Drive, sharing the existing bicycle route, San
Clemente Drive, and Redwood Highway or the former Northwestern Pacific Railroad right-
of-way by the Bay frontage.
Key trail locations are shown on the Pedestrian and Bicycle Lanes map (Figure 4.2).
6.6         RECREATION PROGRAMMING
The Corte Madera Parks and Recreation Department manages park and recreation facilities.
Department duties include acquisition, development and implementation of park and
recreation policies and programs.
Recreational programs are varied, including self-facilitated services such as senior activities,
after-school programs for youth, pre-school programs, teen programs, summer camps,
nature and outdoor programs, health and wellness classes, sports leagues and sports
instruction, youth sports coaches and training, art and dance programs, multicultural
events, and emergency preparedness and support.

7.0 FLOODING AND FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMEN

                       7.0 FLOOD AND FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
7.1         INTRODUCTION
Flooding is the most predictable and potentially most
damaging hazard affecting Corte Madera residents,
property owners and businesses. Measured in terms of
capital investments and management effort, flood control
is the Town’s highest safety priority. Accordingly,
flooding is addressed as a separate element of the
General Plan, distinct from other safety issues. The
Flooding and Flood Plain Management Chapter is
designed to reduce hazards by continuing and reinforcing the Town’s existing flood control
programs and by providing a policy basis for exploring new, long-range approaches to
further reducing the risk.
Increased impermeable surfaces, alterations of natural drainage patterns, and climate
change have increased the frequency and severity of flooding events. With increases in sea
level due to climate change, flooding is predicted to increase in the future, especially when
high tides and more severe storms happen simultaneously. Impacts to hydrological
conditions in the Town can be mitigated with careful consideration in the planning, siting
and construction of proposed developments.
7.2         REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
This chapter has been prepared to fulfill a portion of the California Government Code
requirement for a Safety Element in the General Plan that addresses a variety of hazards,
including flooding. California Government Code §65302g states that the purpose of the
Safety Element is to provide information:
        “for the protection of the community from unreasonable risks associated with the
        effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, and
        dam failure; slope instability leading to landslides, subsidence and other geological
        hazards; flooding; hazardous material accidents; and wildland and urban fire”
        (emphasis added).
Chapter 8 of the General Plan also addresses the Safety Element requirements.
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM
The National Flood Insurance Act, adopted by the U.S. Congress in 1968, made federally
subsidized flood insurance available to property owners if their communities participate in
the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). A community establishes its eligibility to
participate in the NFIP in two ways:

7.0 FLOOD AND FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
     ♦ By adopting and enforcing floodplain management measures to regulate new
          construction, and
     ♦ By ensuring that substantial improvements within Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA’s)
          are designed to eliminate or minimize future flood damage.
 An SFHA is an area within a floodplain having a 1 percent or greater chance of flood
 occurrence within any given year. SFHAs are delineated on flood hazard boundary maps
 issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for individual communities.
 The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of
 1994 make flood insurance mandatory for most properties in SFHAs.
 In 1977 FEMA completed a Flood Insurance Study for Corte Madera that delineates a SFHA
 covering substantial areas of the community.
 CHAPTER 16, MUNICIPAL CODE
 Corte Madera adopted Ordinances 751, 845, and 889 (the latter in 2005), addressing flooding
 damage prevention in the Town. These provisions are contained in Chapter 16 of the
 Municipal Code, which establishes the Town’s eligibility to participate in the National Flood
 Insurance Program. The Town requires all new buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas to
 be built with finished floors at least one foot above base flood elevations established by
 FEMA. The Ordinance requires individual development projects to complete a detailed
 hydrologic study prior to Town issuance of development permits. These studies are aimed
 at identifying downstream areas that experience localized flooding, detailing potential
 impacts that proposed projects could create on these areas, and identifying both on- and off-
 site mitigation measures that would be required to prevent these impacts.
 7.3          FLOODING AND FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW
 Flooding in Corte Madera generally results from a combination of high tides and storm
 runoff in low-lying areas. The extent of flooding is not life threatening, typically impacting
 culverts, channels and other drainage facilities. The Town continues to respond to flooding
 issues through a wide range of facility improvements and by addressing potential storm
 drainage impacts from new development. In many respects, differential settlement of
 streets, curbs, gutters and sidewalks, and not the drainage system per se, result in some of
 Corte Madera’s most pressing flooding problems. Since long-term corrective actions for
 differential settlement are either infeasible or unavailable, the flooding problems associated
 with Town development in areas underlain by Bay Mud is expected to get worse. Policy
 approaches in response to differential settlement, therefore, tend to focus upon short-term
 solutions, such as continued repairs to existing improvements.
 FLOODING CONDITIONS
 Flooding in Corte Madera is generally the result of extreme high tides due to low pressure
 storm cells, storm water runoff, and inadequate drainage channels and systems in certain
General Plan                                                                        Corte Madera

locations, and inadequate levees. When tides are high, storm water cannot drain into San
Francisco Bay. Steep hills south and west of Corte Madera also contribute to the flooding
problem whenever there is severe rain due to inadequate drainage facilities.
Significant waterways that contribute to flooding within the Town include Corte Madera
Creek (draining the Ross Valley watershed), San Clemente Creek (a tidal slough winding
between subdivisions and open space draining runoff into the San Francisco Bay), High
Canal and associated channels, lagoons, and the Shorebird Marsh ponding area. Siltation
within San Clemente Creek has significantly reduced its capacity to carry floodwaters from
Town. Areas of potential flooding are shown on Figure 7.1.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Study for Corte
Madera (1977) determined that all floods of any consequence in Corte Madera have
occurred in the low areas that have been “reclaimed” from the San Francisco Bay’s marsh
and tidal lands. Generally speaking, these reclaimed areas encompass everything in and
east of Madera Gardens and the lands north of Paradise Drive, and as such constitute a
significant portion of the incorporated Town area.
Factors that affect flooding in the bayside area of Corte Madera are precipitation, tides, sea
level rise, sedimentation, land subsidence and substandard drainage design. Bayside streets
flood at certain places during extremely high tides, including those created by a “storm
surge,” or when high tides combine with storm driven waves, rainwater runoff, or both.
Tidal influences are exacerbated during the winter when prolonged high winds and low
barometric pressure raise the water level along the Pacific Coast, and affect areas north of
Paradise Drive, including the Marina Village and Mariner Cove subdivisions, Marin Estates,
the Paradise Shopping Center, and Madera Gardens.
The bayside developments of Mariner Cove and Marina Village are experiencing subsidence
from being built on five to ten feet of fill placed over San Francisco Bay Mud. The land is
sinking faster than predicted when the developments were built 40 to 50 years ago. As a
result, some areas have subsided to elevations that are expected to flood during a 100-year
storm event. Further, storm runoff that naturally would have drained to these areas must
now be conveyed to lagoons and channels and pumped to the San Francisco Bay.
HISTORICAL CONDITIONS
In the early years of the post World War II housing boom, developers built a system of
lagoons and drainage canals to prevent flooding in the lowland areas of the Town.
Foreseeing the need for additional drainage works to facilitate new development, the Town
adopted a comprehensive drainage plan in 1956. The plan designated certain areas for a
“high level” fill method and other areas for a “low level” fill method. The high level method
involved filling low areas so that they would drain properly during the highest probable
tides. The low level method involved protecting the areas to be developed with levees,
allowing the fills to be placed at lower elevations than with the high level method. The low
level method also called for holding ponds to contain runoff during high tides until the
water could be discharged into the Bay with pumps or through culverts with tide gates.

                                        7.0 FLOOD AND FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
In succeeding years drainage problems became more severe due to settlement, poor design,
and poor construction as areas built in conformance with the drainage plan
recommendations experienced flood damage. In 1970 the Town Council commissioned an
updated Master Storm Drainage Plan which was prepared by Yoder – Trotter – Orlob and
Associates. The 1970 Master Plan (often referred to as the YTO report) divided the planning
area into ten separate watersheds, analyzed the existing facilities, and made
recommendations for upgrades to the storm drainage system for each watershed. A number
of important drainage improvements were built under the 1970 Master Plan including
numerous channel and culvert improvements, the Shorebird Pump Station, the Marina
Village Pump Station, the Lagoon 1 Pump Station, the Marquart Lagoon Pump Station, the
Black Kettle Pump Station, the High Canal Pump Station and the San Clemente Creek Pump
Station. The 1970 Master Plan set the foundation of the drainage system that protects Corte
Madera today.
Several drainage studies and reports have been prepared for specific areas of the Town
subsequent to the YTO report. These include (but are not limited to) the Evaluation of
Stormwater Drainage Problems in Watershed 6 by Yarnell and Associates (1979), the
Madera Gardens Flood Control Study by Kennedy/Jenks (1983), the Paradise / San
Clemente Area Drainage Study by Bissell and Karn (1986), the Mariner Cove Flood and
Drainage Study by Winzler and Kelly (1986), a variety of studies prepared for the San
Clemente Creek area in the 1980’s, and numerous studies prepared for the Mariner Cove
Subdivision under the Tidal Protection Project in the 1990’s.
A progress report on the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the 1970
Master Plan was prepared in 1988 by the Town Engineer. The progress report also identified
improvements that deviated from the recommendations in the Master Plan and the rationale
behind those deviations.
The worst flooding in the Town occurred in 1982, when San Clemente Drive was closed as
floodwaters covered the roadway. In response, the Town has overseen the installation of
approximately $30 million of improvements, including eight pump stations. In the mid-
1980s, Corte Madera partnered with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps of Engineers)
to study the possibility of a “permanent” solution to certain types of flooding in the area.
The project identified to resolve the flooding problem is now known as the Tidal Protection
Project. This project, selected from various alternative solutions, consists of an offshore tidal
barrier with a lock, pumps, and tidal exchange gate. The Tidal Barrier Project is still in the
study phase and has not progressed for several years, due to opposition from local
environmental groups, concern from homeowners, lack of funding, and difficulty in
attaining land suitable to mitigate the loss of the required 18 acres of wetland habitat for
environmental mitigation. The Town does not expect the Corps of Engineers to resume
work on the Tidal Barrier Project study.

7.0 FLOOD AND FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
 EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS
 The Town is continually working on ways to identify options to address the tidal flooding
 problems along San Clemente Creek. Proposed mitigation measures include constructing
 levees or other on-shore floodwalls or barriers, raising houses immediately adjacent to San
 Clemente Creek, and improving the drainage infrastructure.
 In response to flooding conditions, many residents in
 the San Clemente Creek area have raised and reinforced
 the foundations when remodeling their homes. The
 Town is addressing flooding conditions through a voter-
 approved Storm Drainage Tax levied on parcels to fund
 maintenance projects for the Town’s existing flood
 control system, to raise money for storm drainage/flood
 control improvements and to pay remaining debts.
 Future improvements will focus on protection from tidal flooding, especially in the Lucky
 Drive area and the Mariner Cove subdivision. Other improvements will include CMP
 (corrugated metal pipe) replacement, pump station upgrades, and 100-year protection for
 the FEMA designated floodplain.
 PROGRAMS
 The Corte Madera Fire Department is responsible for monitoring and responding to
 imminent/actual flooding. The Director of Emergency Services organizes the Emergency
 Operating Center (EOC) staff and emergency procedures, search and rescue teams, and
 provides emergency instructions through local radio stations, such as the Corte Madera
 Emergency Broadcast (1330 AM). The Department of Public Works is in charge of initiating
 sandbagging, levee reinforcement, utility shutoff, and flood fighting activities. Emergency
 response is also coordinated with the Office of Emergency Services (OES) Mutual Aid
 Regional Office. When necessary, evacuation is ordered by the Twin Cities Police
 Department (e.g., dispatching volunteer Community Emergency Response Teams [CERT] to
 inform residents of flood danger and evacuation methods).
 In 1986, the Corte Madera Town Council established the Flood Control Board, as the
 successor to the Flood Control Committee. The purpose of the Flood Control Board is to
 advise the Town Council on all matters affecting flooding in Corte Madera and to
 recommend ways to provide flood protection for the Town.
 The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA) requires local governments to develop and
 submit mitigation plans by November 1, 2004 as a condition of receiving Hazard Mitigation
 Grant Program and other related funds. FEMA will continue to make funds available for
 hazard mitigation planning. Also, FEMA distributes monies for Flood Mitigation
 Assistance to States that, in turn, provide funds to communities. The emphasis for
 allocating these funds is on repetitive loss properties.

7.0 FLOODING AND FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMEN

                       7.0 FLOOD AND FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
7.1         INTRODUCTION
Flooding is the most predictable and potentially most
damaging hazard affecting Corte Madera residents,
property owners and businesses. Measured in terms of
capital investments and management effort, flood control
is the Town’s highest safety priority. Accordingly,
flooding is addressed as a separate element of the
General Plan, distinct from other safety issues. The
Flooding and Flood Plain Management Chapter is
designed to reduce hazards by continuing and reinforcing the Town’s existing flood control
programs and by providing a policy basis for exploring new, long-range approaches to
further reducing the risk.
Increased impermeable surfaces, alterations of natural drainage patterns, and climate
change have increased the frequency and severity of flooding events. With increases in sea
level due to climate change, flooding is predicted to increase in the future, especially when
high tides and more severe storms happen simultaneously. Impacts to hydrological
conditions in the Town can be mitigated with careful consideration in the planning, siting
and construction of proposed developments.
7.2         REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
This chapter has been prepared to fulfill a portion of the California Government Code
requirement for a Safety Element in the General Plan that addresses a variety of hazards,
including flooding. California Government Code §65302g states that the purpose of the
Safety Element is to provide information:
        “for the protection of the community from unreasonable risks associated with the
        effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, and
        dam failure; slope instability leading to landslides, subsidence and other geological
        hazards; flooding; hazardous material accidents; and wildland and urban fire”
        (emphasis added).
Chapter 8 of the General Plan also addresses the Safety Element requirements.
NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM
The National Flood Insurance Act, adopted by the U.S. Congress in 1968, made federally
subsidized flood insurance available to property owners if their communities participate in
the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). A community establishes its eligibility to
participate in the NFIP in two ways:

     ♦ By adopting and enforcing floodplain management measures to regulate new
          construction, and
     ♦ By ensuring that substantial improvements within Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA’s)
          are designed to eliminate or minimize future flood damage.
 An SFHA is an area within a floodplain having a 1 percent or greater chance of flood
 occurrence within any given year. SFHAs are delineated on flood hazard boundary maps
 issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for individual communities.
 The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of
 1994 make flood insurance mandatory for most properties in SFHAs.
 In 1977 FEMA completed a Flood Insurance Study for Corte Madera that delineates a SFHA
 covering substantial areas of the community.
 CHAPTER 16, MUNICIPAL CODE
 Corte Madera adopted Ordinances 751, 845, and 889 (the latter in 2005), addressing flooding
 damage prevention in the Town. These provisions are contained in Chapter 16 of the
 Municipal Code, which establishes the Town’s eligibility to participate in the National Flood
 Insurance Program. The Town requires all new buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas to
 be built with finished floors at least one foot above base flood elevations established by
 FEMA. The Ordinance requires individual development projects to complete a detailed
 hydrologic study prior to Town issuance of development permits. These studies are aimed
 at identifying downstream areas that experience localized flooding, detailing potential
 impacts that proposed projects could create on these areas, and identifying both on- and off-
 site mitigation measures that would be required to prevent these impacts.
 7.3          FLOODING AND FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW
 Flooding in Corte Madera generally results from a combination of high tides and storm
 runoff in low-lying areas. The extent of flooding is not life threatening, typically impacting
 culverts, channels and other drainage facilities. The Town continues to respond to flooding
 issues through a wide range of facility improvements and by addressing potential storm
 drainage impacts from new development. In many respects, differential settlement of
 streets, curbs, gutters and sidewalks, and not the drainage system per se, result in some of
 Corte Madera’s most pressing flooding problems. Since long-term corrective actions for
 differential settlement are either infeasible or unavailable, the flooding problems associated
 with Town development in areas underlain by Bay Mud is expected to get worse. Policy
 approaches in response to differential settlement, therefore, tend to focus upon short-term
 solutions, such as continued repairs to existing improvements.
 FLOODING CONDITIONS
 Flooding in Corte Madera is generally the result of extreme high tides due to low pressure
 storm cells, storm water runoff, and inadequate drainage channels and systems in certain
General Plan                                                                        Corte Madera

locations, and inadequate levees. When tides are high, storm water cannot drain into San
Francisco Bay. Steep hills south and west of Corte Madera also contribute to the flooding
problem whenever there is severe rain due to inadequate drainage facilities.
Significant waterways that contribute to flooding within the Town include Corte Madera
Creek (draining the Ross Valley watershed), San Clemente Creek (a tidal slough winding
between subdivisions and open space draining runoff into the San Francisco Bay), High
Canal and associated channels, lagoons, and the Shorebird Marsh ponding area. Siltation
within San Clemente Creek has significantly reduced its capacity to carry floodwaters from
Town. Areas of potential flooding are shown on Figure 7.1.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Study for Corte
Madera (1977) determined that all floods of any consequence in Corte Madera have
occurred in the low areas that have been “reclaimed” from the San Francisco Bay’s marsh
and tidal lands. Generally speaking, these reclaimed areas encompass everything in and
east of Madera Gardens and the lands north of Paradise Drive, and as such constitute a
significant portion of the incorporated Town area.
Factors that affect flooding in the bayside area of Corte Madera are precipitation, tides, sea
level rise, sedimentation, land subsidence and substandard drainage design. Bayside streets
flood at certain places during extremely high tides, including those created by a “storm
surge,” or when high tides combine with storm driven waves, rainwater runoff, or both.
Tidal influences are exacerbated during the winter when prolonged high winds and low
barometric pressure raise the water level along the Pacific Coast, and affect areas north of
Paradise Drive, including the Marina Village and Mariner Cove subdivisions, Marin Estates,
the Paradise Shopping Center, and Madera Gardens.
The bayside developments of Mariner Cove and Marina Village are experiencing subsidence
from being built on five to ten feet of fill placed over San Francisco Bay Mud. The land is
sinking faster than predicted when the developments were built 40 to 50 years ago. As a
result, some areas have subsided to elevations that are expected to flood during a 100-year
storm event. Further, storm runoff that naturally would have drained to these areas must
now be conveyed to lagoons and channels and pumped to the San Francisco Bay.
HISTORICAL CONDITIONS
In the early years of the post World War II housing boom, developers built a system of
lagoons and drainage canals to prevent flooding in the lowland areas of the Town.
Foreseeing the need for additional drainage works to facilitate new development, the Town
adopted a comprehensive drainage plan in 1956. The plan designated certain areas for a
“high level” fill method and other areas for a “low level” fill method. The high level method
involved filling low areas so that they would drain properly during the highest probable
tides. The low level method involved protecting the areas to be developed with levees,
allowing the fills to be placed at lower elevations than with the high level method. The low
level method also called for holding ponds to contain runoff during high tides until the
water could be discharged into the Bay with pumps or through culverts with tide gates.

                                        7.0 FLOOD AND FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
In succeeding years drainage problems became more severe due to settlement, poor design,
and poor construction as areas built in conformance with the drainage plan
recommendations experienced flood damage. In 1970 the Town Council commissioned an
updated Master Storm Drainage Plan which was prepared by Yoder – Trotter – Orlob and
Associates. The 1970 Master Plan (often referred to as the YTO report) divided the planning
area into ten separate watersheds, analyzed the existing facilities, and made
recommendations for upgrades to the storm drainage system for each watershed. A number
of important drainage improvements were built under the 1970 Master Plan including
numerous channel and culvert improvements, the Shorebird Pump Station, the Marina
Village Pump Station, the Lagoon 1 Pump Station, the Marquart Lagoon Pump Station, the
Black Kettle Pump Station, the High Canal Pump Station and the San Clemente Creek Pump
Station. The 1970 Master Plan set the foundation of the drainage system that protects Corte
Madera today.
Several drainage studies and reports have been prepared for specific areas of the Town
subsequent to the YTO report. These include (but are not limited to) the Evaluation of
Stormwater Drainage Problems in Watershed 6 by Yarnell and Associates (1979), the
Madera Gardens Flood Control Study by Kennedy/Jenks (1983), the Paradise / San
Clemente Area Drainage Study by Bissell and Karn (1986), the Mariner Cove Flood and
Drainage Study by Winzler and Kelly (1986), a variety of studies prepared for the San
Clemente Creek area in the 1980’s, and numerous studies prepared for the Mariner Cove
Subdivision under the Tidal Protection Project in the 1990’s.
A progress report on the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the 1970
Master Plan was prepared in 1988 by the Town Engineer. The progress report also identified
improvements that deviated from the recommendations in the Master Plan and the rationale
behind those deviations.
The worst flooding in the Town occurred in 1982, when San Clemente Drive was closed as
floodwaters covered the roadway. In response, the Town has overseen the installation of
approximately $30 million of improvements, including eight pump stations. In the mid-
1980s, Corte Madera partnered with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps of Engineers)
to study the possibility of a “permanent” solution to certain types of flooding in the area.
The project identified to resolve the flooding problem is now known as the Tidal Protection
Project. This project, selected from various alternative solutions, consists of an offshore tidal
barrier with a lock, pumps, and tidal exchange gate. The Tidal Barrier Project is still in the
study phase and has not progressed for several years, due to opposition from local
environmental groups, concern from homeowners, lack of funding, and difficulty in
attaining land suitable to mitigate the loss of the required 18 acres of wetland habitat for
environmental mitigation. The Town does not expect the Corps of Engineers to resume
work on the Tidal Barrier Project study.

 EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS
 The Town is continually working on ways to identify options to address the tidal flooding
 problems along San Clemente Creek. Proposed mitigation measures include constructing
 levees or other on-shore floodwalls or barriers, raising houses immediately adjacent to San
 Clemente Creek, and improving the drainage infrastructure.
 In response to flooding conditions, many residents in
 the San Clemente Creek area have raised and reinforced
 the foundations when remodeling their homes. The
 Town is addressing flooding conditions through a voter-
 approved Storm Drainage Tax levied on parcels to fund
 maintenance projects for the Town’s existing flood
 control system, to raise money for storm drainage/flood
 control improvements and to pay remaining debts.
 Future improvements will focus on protection from tidal flooding, especially in the Lucky
 Drive area and the Mariner Cove subdivision. Other improvements will include CMP
 (corrugated metal pipe) replacement, pump station upgrades, and 100-year protection for
 the FEMA designated floodplain.
 PROGRAMS
 The Corte Madera Fire Department is responsible for monitoring and responding to
 imminent/actual flooding. The Director of Emergency Services organizes the Emergency
 Operating Center (EOC) staff and emergency procedures, search and rescue teams, and
 provides emergency instructions through local radio stations, such as the Corte Madera
 Emergency Broadcast (1330 AM). The Department of Public Works is in charge of initiating
 sandbagging, levee reinforcement, utility shutoff, and flood fighting activities. Emergency
 response is also coordinated with the Office of Emergency Services (OES) Mutual Aid
 Regional Office. When necessary, evacuation is ordered by the Twin Cities Police
 Department (e.g., dispatching volunteer Community Emergency Response Teams [CERT] to
 inform residents of flood danger and evacuation methods).
 In 1986, the Corte Madera Town Council established the Flood Control Board, as the
 successor to the Flood Control Committee. The purpose of the Flood Control Board is to
 advise the Town Council on all matters affecting flooding in Corte Madera and to
 recommend ways to provide flood protection for the Town.
 The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA) requires local governments to develop and
 submit mitigation plans by November 1, 2004 as a condition of receiving Hazard Mitigation
 Grant Program and other related funds. FEMA will continue to make funds available for
 hazard mitigation planning. Also, FEMA distributes monies for Flood Mitigation
 Assistance to States that, in turn, provide funds to communities. The emphasis for
 allocating these funds is on repetitive loss properties.

8.0 PUBLIC SAFETY AND HAZARD

                                        8.0 PUBLIC SAFETY AND HAZARDS
8.1         INTRODUCTION
The Public Safety and Hazards chapter is designed to
establish policies and implementation programs that
will protect the Town from risks associated with
seismic, geologic, flood, fire and environmental hazards.
By identifying these hazards and the appropriate
abatement provisions, the Public Safety and Hazards
chapter will effectively reduce the potential for life
threatening, property damaging, and economically and
socially detrimental events. Hazards related to flooding
are addressed in Chapter 7, Flooding and Floodplain Management.
The state-required Noise and Safety Elements, included in this chapter, identify and
appraise noise and safety problems within the Town, are used as guides for establishing
land use patterns that minimize the exposure of Town residents to excessive natural and
man-made hazards.
8.2         REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
Pursuant to California Government Code §65302g, the purpose of the Safety Element is to
provide information:
        “for the protection of the community from unreasonable risks associated with the
        effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, and
        dam failure; slope instability leading to landslides, subsidence and other geological
        hazards; flooding; hazardous material accidents; and wildland and urban fire.” The
        requirement to consider flooding hazards is addressed in Chapter 7 of the General
        Plan.
State law also requires preparation of a Noise Element, which must include recommended
land use compatibility standards for community noise environments, consistent with
Department of Health Service guidelines, pursuant to Health and Safety Code §46050.1.
GEOLOGY
The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (formerly the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies
Zone Act), signed into law in December 1972, requires the delineation of zones along active
faults in California. The purpose of the Alquist-Priolo Act is to regulate development on or
near active fault traces to reduce the hazard of fault rupture and to prohibit the location of
most structures for human occupancy across these traces. Cities and counties must regulate
certain development projects within the zones, which includes the withholding of permits
until geologic investigations demonstrate that development sites are not threatened by

 future surface displacement (Hart, 1997). Surface fault rupture is not necessarily restricted to
 the area within an Alquist-Priolo Zone. The project site is not located within an Alquist-
 Priolo Fault Rupture Zone.
 AIR QUALITY
 Federal Air Quality Programs
 Air pollution control and planning began in earnest in 1967 with the passage of the Federal
 Clean Air Act. In 1970 the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) was
 established for six pollutants. These pollutants are commonly referred to as "criteria"
 pollutants because criteria documents, which establish the relationship between exposure
 and effects on human health, have been prepared for each contaminant. The Act required
 states exceeding the NAAQS to prepare air quality plans showing how the standards were
 to be met by 1987. The Act was amended in 1977 and in 1990 to extend the deadline for
 compliance. Failure to submit and implement an acceptable plan meant a state could be
 denied federal highway funding.
 State Air Quality Programs
 In 1988 the California legislature passed the California Clean Air Act, which required air
 districts to develop air quality plans for the state standards. In general, the California Clean
 Air Act required the reduction of air pollutants by five percent or more per year, or the
 implementation of "all feasible measures" to meet the state air quality standards as
 expeditiously as possible.
 At the time of this General Plan, there are no regulations setting ambient air quality
 emissions standards for greenhouse gases, although the regulatory environment may
 change due to recent State legislation regarding climate change. Chapter 3 (Resource
 Conservation and Sustainability) provides an overview of climate change, and provides
 goals, policies, and implementation programs to mitigate GHG emissions in the Town.
 Regional Air Quality Programs
 The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) was established by the
 California Legislature to maintain and operate a regional air quality monitoring network to
 gauge progress toward attaining federal and state air quality standards. The BAAQMD rule
 Development Program develops and enforces regulations to maintain air quality. Land uses
 and activities that may cause air pollution must apply to the BAAQMD for air quality
 permits.

8.3          FIRE HAZARDS
The Town of Corte Madera faces an ongoing threat from urban and wildland fire, caused by
human activity and natural conditions. Wildland fire is a persistent threat to the hillside
residential neighborhoods in Corte Madera where the wildland and residential areas
intermix. The potential for wildland fires arises from the combination of ground cover and
vegetation, the combustibility of building materials, ground slope, weather patterns,
adequacy of access, water supply, and water pressure. Areas of heavy or unmanaged
vegetation increase the danger to people and structures from fire, a significant issue for
Corte Madera given the many adjoining open space preserves. The fuel load is particularly
high in the hillside residential areas. Structures built with combustible materials, such as
wood siding, shake roofs, and flammable landscaping heighten the vulnerability of
residents in hillside areas.
Once ignited, wildland fires can be difficult to contain. Hillside residents’ commitment to
fire safety is critical.
FIRE AND MEDICAL SERVICES
The Corte Madera Fire Department provides for the
safety, health, and well-being of all individuals, property,
and the environment through a comprehensive range of
programs designed to respond to threats from fire
hazards. Their primary activity is response to requests for
service, particularly medical assistance and structure
fires.    Other goals and objectives include disaster
preparedness and fire prevention through community
outreach and public education, training courses,
maintenance (roads, station upgrades), and annual
inspections of public and private property.
Fire Department personnel annually conduct fire inspections of every business in Corte
Madera. The Fire Department also works with the Marin Municipal Water District and the
Fire Flow Committee to continually upgrade water lines, supply, and hydrants throughout
the jurisdiction. Vehicle and equipment maintenance, as well as vigorous vegetation
management and fire road maintenance, are high priorities for the Fire Department. All fire
roads within the Town are surveyed annually in the spring in an effort to improve fire
protection in the wildland interface. The Marin Open Space District is responsible for
vegetation management of County open space lands in the Christmas Tree and
Meadowsweet areas, while the Corte Madera Fire Department is responsible for the open
space area by Ring Mountain.
Medical services in the Town are provided by the Corte Madera Fire Department. The
Department provides paramedic ambulance service, and has an agreement with the Ross
Corte Madera                                                                     General Plan

 Valley Paramedic Authority for additional service if needed. The primary hospitals in the
 area are Marin General in Larkspur and Kaiser Hospital in San Rafael.
 DISASTER COUNCIL
 Since the early 1990’s the Town has worked directly with residents to raise the level of
 community preparedness for major catastrophic events. In 1993 the Town Council
 established the Disaster Council made up of citizens, representatives of the business
 community and other organizations, and Town staff. The Disaster Council was initially
 charged with reviewing and updating the Town’s Emergency Operations Plan. The Disaster
 Council has been a forum for initiating programs that make the community better prepared
 for emergencies, including:
     ♦ The Disaster Preparedness Book, a handbook for residents that is distributed to all
         homes in the community.
     ♦ AM 1330, Town-owned radio broadcast station that can be used to give residents vital
         information during an emergency.
     ♦ The Town’s emergency siren which is used in a sudden emergency to alert residents to
         tune in AM 1330.
     ♦ Under the AED program, Automated External Defibrillators are donated and installed at
         various locations throughout the Town.
     ♦ Emergency generators have been installed at each of the Town’s principle facilities to
         assure safety services will continue during power outages.
     ♦ Contracts with a variety of businesses to make resources available during an emergency.
 EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS
 Many residents live in the wooded hillside areas to enjoy the pristine views and solitude.
 However, this can be in conflict with safety issues that may arise from a wildland fire or
 other natural disaster. One of the biggest challenges the Corte Madera Fire Department
 faces is adequate residential hillside access (ingress for emergency vehicles and egress for
 residents). Roads are narrow and often very steep, with sharp twists and turns. There are
 few pullouts for emergency vehicles, and if a disaster were to occur, a mass exodus could
 prevent emergency vehicle access altogether.
 Ongoing aggressive vegetation management is required by all hillside dwellers to prevent
 wildland fire. Unfortunately, this is not always adhered to because of the desire to preserve
 trees with the result that current fire loads are high. Residents can better protect and equip
 themselves in the event of a wildland fire by providing on-going yard and home
 maintenance, adhering to red flag days, and keeping scotch broom weeded. Hillside
 residents are encouraged to learn the trails and footpaths in their neighborhoods for use as
 alternative escape routes.

COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAINING (CERT)
Emergency preparedness planning recognizes that in the first 72 hours after a major disaster
residents must be self-sufficient. Disaster preparedness involves planning efforts by local
government, private organizations, and local groups to identify resources, provide public
awareness, and formulate plans about what to do in an emergency situation.
The Fire Department issues an Emergency Preparedness
Handbook in preparation for catastrophic events as part of
its disaster preparedness program and conducts two-day
Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) classes for
the general public and business community. The goal of this
program is to help the citizens of Corte Madera become self-
sufficient in the event of a major disaster by acquiring
hands-on disaster training. Emergency preparedness
training for Fire Department staff includes earthquake and
wildfire courses, paramedic training, Emergency Medical Technician training, confined
space rescue, wildland survival classes, and a multi-agency disaster drill.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTES
Hazardous materials consist of any substance which has the potential to cause injury, and
can include flammable liquids and gases, poisons, corrosives, explosives, radioactive
materials, and medical supplies and wastes.
The storage and clean-up (remediation) of hazardous sites is regulated by a series of federal,
state and local agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Cal EPA, the
State Department of Toxic Substance Control and Marin County’s Certified Unified
Program Agency (CUPA). Because of a general lack of significant industrial operations,
Corte Madera does not experience any significant threat from the use or storage of
hazardous materials. However, the State has identified over 20 hazardous waste sites in
Corte Madera, all of which involve issues of leaking underground storage tanks (LUST’s).
These are typically associated with past automobile-related activities, such as service
stations and automobile repair shops, and tend to be located in proximity to Highway 101,
including sites on Tamalpais Drive, Paradise Drive and Tamal Vista. The primary risk they
pose is leaking gasoline and diesel fuel hydrocarbons and related compounds into the soil
and groundwater. Most of the sites have undergone successful remediation (which usually
involves removal of the underground tanks and any contaminated soil). The State has
indicated that the remaining sites require no further investigation.
The transport of hazardous materials, particularly along the Highway 101 corridor, presents
possible hazards in the event of a materials leak or if a transport truck experiences an
accident. The Corte Madera Fire Department and CUPA hazards teams would respond to
any such incidents. The Hazardous Materials Management Plan for the Town identifies
places where flammable or toxic materials are used and stored, allowing appropriate
response to a fire or other emergency. Mutual aid agreements with other agencies also
expand the response capabilities for such emergencies.

8.5        NOISE
Noise in the community has often been cited as a health problem, not in terms of actual
physiological damages such as hearing impairment, but in terms of inhibiting general well-
being and contributing to undue stress and annoyance. The health effects of noise in the
community arise from interference with human activities such as sleep, speech, recreation
and tasks demanding concentration or coordination. When community noise interferes with
human activities or contributes to stress, public annoyance with the noise source increases
and the acceptability of the environment for people decreases. This decrease in acceptability
and the threat to public well-being are the basis for land use planning policies preventing
exposures to excessive community noise levels.
Many jurisdictions, including Corte Madera, have adopted community noise control
ordinances to control noise from fixed sources. Such ordinances are intended to abate noise
nuisances and to control noise from existing sources. They may also be used as performance
standards to judge the creation of a potential nuisance, or potential encroachment of
sensitive uses upon noise-producing facilities.
In very quiet environments, the introduction of virtually any        The “ambient” noise
change in local activities may cause an increase in noise             level can be defined
levels. Audibility of a new noise source and/or increases in                as the all-
noise levels within recognized acceptable limits are not              encompassing noise
usually considered to be significant noise impacts, but these           level associated
concerns should be addressed and considered in the                     with a given noise
planning and environmental review processes.                             environment.
The ambient noise environment in Corte Madera is defined primarily by traffic on Highway
101, which runs north and south through town. At locations removed from Highway 101,
the ambient noise environment tends to be defined by local traffic and typical neighborhood
noise sources. No significant noise-producing commercial or industrial activities are
identified within the Town of Corte Madera. The only concentration of such activities is in
proximity to Highway 101, which tends to mask noise generated by these sources.
FUNDAMENTALS OF NOISE
Noise is often described as unwanted sound, and is defined as any pressure variation in air
that the human ear can detect. If the pressure variations occur frequently enough (at least 20
times per second), they can be heard and hence are called sound. The number of pressure
variations per second is called the frequency of sound, and is expressed as cycles per
second, called Hertz (Hz).
Measuring sound directly in terms of pressure would require a very large and awkward
range of numbers. To avoid this, the decibel scale was devised. The decibel scale uses the
hearing threshold (20 micropascals) as a point of reference, defined as 0 dB. Other sound
pressures are then compared to the reference pressure, and the logarithm is taken to keep
the numbers in a practical range. The decibel scale allows a million-fold increase in pressure

 to be expressed as 120 dB. Another useful aspect of the decibel scale is that changes in levels
 (dB) correspond closely to human perception of relative loudness.
 The perceived loudness of sounds is dependent upon sound pressure level and frequency
 content. However, within the usual range of environmental noise levels, perception of
 loudness is relatively predictable, and can be approximated by weighing the frequency
 response of a sound level meter by means of the standardized A-weighing network. There is
 a strong correlation between A-weighted sound levels (expressed as dBA) and community
 response to noise. For this reason, the A-weighted sound level has become the standard tool
 of environmental noise assessment.
 Examples of A-weighted sound levels of some common noise sources:
         ♦ Soft whisper at 2 feet                               30 decibels
         ♦ Background noise in a residence                      40 decibels
         ♦ Open office background noise                         50 decibels
         ♦ Normal conversation at 5-10 feet                     60 decibels
         ♦ Commercial jet aircraft interior                     70 decibels
         ♦ Locomotive at 300 feet                               80 decibels
         ♦ Bulldozer at 50 feet                                 90 decibels
 Community noise is commonly described in terms of the “ambient” noise level, which is
 defined as the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given noise environment. A
 common statistical tool to measure the ambient noise level is the average, or equivalent,
 sound level (Leq), which corresponds to a steady-state A-weighted sound level containing
 the same total energy as a time-varying signal over a given time period (usually one hour).
 The Leq is the foundation of the composite noise descriptor, Ldn, and shows good
 correlation with community response to noise.
 The Day-Night Average Level (Ldn) is based upon the average noise level over a 24-hour
 day, with a +10 decibel weighing applied to noise occurring during nighttime (10:00 p.m. to
 7:00 a.m.) hours. The nighttime penalty is based upon the assumption that people react to
 nighttime noise exposures as though they were twice as loud as daytime exposures. Because
 Ldn represents a 24-hour average, it tends to disguise short-term variations in the noise
 environment.
 NOISE MITIGATION OPTIONS
 Noise problems have three basic elements: the noise source, a transmission path, and a
 receiver. The appropriate acoustical treatment for a given project depends on the nature of

the noise source and the sensitivity of the receiver. The problem should be defined in terms
of appropriate criteria (Ldn, Leq, or Lmax), the location of the sensitive receiver (inside or
outside), and when the problem occurs (daytime or nighttime). Noise control techniques
should then be selected to provide an acceptable noise environment for the receiving
property while remaining consistent with local aesthetic standards and practical structural
and economic limits. Fundamental noise control techniques include the use of setback areas,
physical noise barriers, incorporation of site design techniques (including placement and
uses of structures), building design, acoustical design of building facades, and placement of
site vegetation.
EXISTING NOISE ENVIRONMENT
Overview
The major noise source in Corte Madera is Highway 101; noise generated by traffic on local
streets and within neighborhood parks is considered secondary. There are no significant
sources of railroad, aircraft or industrial noise within the Town of Corte Madera. Noise
contours are shown on Figure 8.1.
Roadways
The Federal Highway Administration Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (FHWA-
RD-77-108) with vehicle noise emission curves was used to predict traffic noise levels within
Corte Madera Town Limits. The FHWA Model is the traffic noise prediction model
currently preferred by the Federal Highway Administration, the State of California
Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and most Town and county governments, for use
in traffic noise assessment. Although the FHWA Model is in the process of being updated
by a more sophisticated traffic noise prediction model, the use of RD-77-108 is considered
acceptable for the development of General Plan traffic noise predictions.
    ♦ Noisy locations within Town limits include:
    ♦ Fifer Avenue between Tamal Vista Boulevard and Nellen Avenue
    ♦ Nellen Avenue south of Fifer Avenue
    ♦ Highway 101 south of Industrial
    ♦ Highway 101 north of Tamalpais Drive
    ♦ Madera Boulevard north of Mohawk Avenue

Non-Transportation Noise Sources
Noise is an inevitable by-product of many activities, even when the best available noise
control technology is applied. Although noise within industrial facilities is controlled by
Federal and State employee health and safety regulations (OSHA), exterior noise levels may
exceed locally acceptable standards. Commercial, recreational and public service facility
activities can also produce noise that affects adjacent sensitive land uses.
From a land use planning perspective, there are two goals for controlling fixed-source noise:
to prevent the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive areas, and to
prevent encroachment of noise-sensitive uses upon existing noise-producing facilities. The
first goal can be achieved by applying noise performance standards to proposed new noise-
producing uses. The second goal can be met by requiring that new noise-sensitive uses in
proximity to noise-producing facilities include mitigation measures to ensure compliance
with those noise performance standards.
Descriptions of some general types of existing fixed noise sources in the Town of Corte
Madera are provided below. These uses are intended to be representative of the relative
noise generation of such uses, and are intended to identify specific noise sources that should
be considered in the review of development proposals. Site-specific noise analyses should
be performed where noise sensitive land uses are proposed in proximity to these (or similar)
noise sources, or where similar sources are proposed to be located near noise-sensitive land
uses.
General Service Commercial and Light Industrial Uses
Noise sources associated with service commercial uses such as automotive and truck repair
facilities, tire installation centers, car washes, loading docks, corporation yards, etc., are
found within relative close proximity to Highway 101 within Town limits. The noise
emissions of these types of uses are dependant on many factors, and are therefore, difficult
to quantify precisely. Nonetheless, noise generated by the these uses contributes to the
ambient noise environment in the immediate vicinity of these uses, and should be
considered where either new noise-sensitive uses are proposed nearby or where similar uses
are proposed in existing residential areas.

 Parks and School Playing Fields
 Parks and school playgrounds, and their associated uses, are located throughout the Town.
 Noise generated by these uses depends on the age and number of people utilizing the
 respective facilities at a given time, and types of activities they are engaged in. School play
 field activities tend to generate more noise than those of neighborhood parks, because the
 intensity of school playground usage tends to be much higher. At a distance of 100 feet from
 an elementary school playground being used by 100 students, average and maximum noise
 levels of 60 and 75 dB, respectively, can be expected. At organized events such as high-
 school football games with large crowds and public address systems, the noise generation is
 often significantly higher. As with service commercial uses, the noise generation of parks
 and school playing fields is variable.
 Airports
 There are no airports or helipads within the general vicinity of the Town of Corte Madera.
 As a result, the existing ambient noise environment of the Town is not significantly
 influenced by aircraft noise, although aircraft fly-overs from other communities are possible.

     1) For traffic noise within Corte Madera, Ldn and peak-hour Leq values are estimated
         to be approximately similar. Interior noise level standards are applied within noise-
         sensitive areas of the various land uses, with windows and doors in the closed
         positions.
     2) Outdoor activity areas for single-family residential uses are defined as backyards.
         For large parcels or residences with no clearly defined outdoor activity area, the
         standard shall be applicable within a 100-foot radius of the residence.
     3) For multi-family residential uses, and for mixed-use projects that include residential
         units, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied at the common outdoor
         recreation area, such as at pools, play areas or tennis courts.
     4) Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Ldn or less
         using a practical application of the best-available noise reduction measures, an
         exterior noise level of up to 65 dB Ldn may be allowed provided that available
         exterior noise level reduction measures have been implemented and interior noise
         levels are in compliance with this table.

 8.7          GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
 TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY
 The topography of Corte Madera is varied, from the lowlands along the edge of the San
 Francisco Bay to the steeply sloping hillsides of residential neighborhoods on Chapman Hill
 and on Christmas Tree Hill along the Corte Madera Ridge.
 Three structural blocks, roughly separated by the active San Andreas and Hayward faults,
 characterize the geology of Marin County. Corte Madera lies within the San Francisco-
 Marin block, approximately nine miles northeast of the San Andreas Fault.
 Corte Madera is located on the Bay side of southern Marin County, which consists of two
 geological terrains: upland terrain of hills and ridges with steep slopes (such as the Corte
 Madera Ridge and residential neighborhoods leading up to Ring Mountain Preserve), and
 lowland terrain with subdivisions of valley lands and Bay lands. Different types of bedrock
 underlie the upland terrain. The Tiburon Peninsula Ridge (east of Highway 101) is topped
 by sheets of serpentine separated from the underlying sandstones and shale of Franciscan
 mélange. Mélange is composed of small to large hard rocks embedded in sheared and
 crushed rock. West of Highway 101 the ridges and knolls are made up of Franciscan
 sandstone. Mélange underlies some of the lower slopes in the older parts of Town.
 The valley lands have surface deposits of alluvium, which consists of clay, silt, sand, and
 gravel deposited by streams, and colluvium, which is deposits of unsorted soil material and
 rock fragments that accumulate at the base of slopes by gravity or landslide movement. The
 Bay lands are underlain by bedrock of the old valleys, now filled by sediments. Bay lands
 include Bay plains, marshes, and mudflats, which are primarily silt and clay transported by
 the Sacramento River and deposited by Bay tidewaters. These deposits are called Bay Mud.
 This soft mud is the most recent sediment deposited in the Bay. Corte Madera’s lowlands
 are characterized by contrasting extremes, with hard bedrock peninsulas and islands rising
 sharply out of Bay Mud marshlands. The lowland terrain also includes large areas of man-
 placed fill within the Bay lands.
 GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
 Slope Failure
 The major geologic- and soils-related hazards in Corte Madera are hill slope failure and
 static settlement of soils. Potential for hill slope failure, or landslide, depends upon the
 geologic composition of a slope. Certain combinations of rocks and soils are more stable
 than others, and hill slope failure can occur without an earthquake. Landslides involve the
 downslope movement of soil and rock; earthquake-induced landslides will most likely
 occur in the same areas where landslides are caused by other conditions. Unstable slopes
 and soils subject to static settlement can become more acute during an earthquake. The
 slopes of the Tiburon Peninsula Ridge, located east of Highway 101, are among the least
 stable areas. Changes made by man, such as excavating too steeply, undercutting slopes, or

placing fills or structures on unstable slopes, may also induce landsliding. A large landslide
was induced west of Highway 101 by excavating Alto Hill during construction of the
highway. Scattered landslides have also occurred in the upland areas west of Highway 101.
Regional landslide mapping has indicated the presence of extensive slope stability hazards
in Corte Madera, with the hazard typically more pronounced on steeper slopes. The hazards
can include relatively large, loose debris flows. Generalized slope stability maps are shown
on Figure 8.2.
Subsidence
Static settlement, or subsidence, is a safety hazard in the lowland areas of Corte Madera. Much of
Corte Madera was built on fill deposited on Bay lands, such as marsh or tidelands. Bay Mud is soft,
unconsolidated and water-saturated clay that becomes compact under the weight of fill and urban
development. Bay Mud has severe stability problems because the mud is highly compressible.
When fills are placed over thick Bay Mud deposits, large amounts of settlement can take place over
long periods of time. Subsidence of Bay Mud is an on-going condition. This subsidence can subject
low-lying areas to frequent flooding due to differential settlement. Indeed, subsidence is one of the
major contributing factors to the steadily increasing flood hazard in Corte Madera.
The primary influence on the amount of subsidence at a given location is the thickness of the
underlying Bay Mud. The thicker the Bay Mud layer, the longer consolidation will take place with a
greater amount of subsidence. Bay Mud varies in thickness, so the amount of settlement varies
between areas. Differential settlement of Bay Mud in Corte Madera has resulted in reconstruction of
streets, sidewalks, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, and periodic maintenance of sewers and streets.
Seismic Hazards
Corte Madera is relatively close to known active earthquake faults, including the San
Andreas, Hayward, and Calaveras Faults. The Town is approximately eight miles northeast
of the San Andreas Fault zone and eleven miles southwest of the Hayward Fault zone.
While high magnitude earthquakes along these faults can be felt and can cause damage,
there are no direct reports of damage in Corte Madera as a result of major quakes. There are
no known active faults in Corte Madera, making ground rupture an unlikely hazard.
Nevertheless, the intense ground shaking poses a significant threat to life and property.
A critical factor affecting the intensity of ground shaking is the geologic material
underneath a site. Deep, loose soils, such as the clays and Bay Mud prevalent in the lowland
areas of Town, will amplify and prolong the shaking. The type of rock that least amplifies
ground shaking is granite. Ground shaking can be several times greater on sites underlain
by weak sediments, like Bay Mud, than on bedrock. Losses from shaking can occur where
tall structures are built on thick, soft sediments. Damage from shaking is also influenced by
the structural integrity of buildings before an earthquake. Damage to buildings and utilities
in the Town of Corte Madera is likely to be greatest on those sites underlain by deep, loose,
compressible deposits such as Bay Mud. These areas include the lowland residential
neighborhoods built on fill.

8.0 PUBLIC SAFETY AND HAZARDS
 Ground failure is a secondary effect of ground shaking and can include landslides,
 liquefaction, lurching, and differential settlement. Liquefaction occurs when saturated and
 poorly consolidated granular material is shaken during an earthquake and is transformed
 into a fluid-like state. Buildings can tilt or sink, utility lines can rise to the surface, and levees
 can fail. If soils are poorly consolidated, the ground can subside. Corte Madera faces the
 hazardous potential for liquefaction of man-placed fill and Bay Mud sediments.
 Neighborhoods built on filled Bay Mud are the most susceptible.
 The Town typically requires geotechnical investigations for new development, including
 single-family residences. Mitigation for new construction often includes installation of deep
 foundation support piers (anchored to bedrock), installation of appropriate drainage
 improvements around a structure, and seismic design pursuant to the Uniform Building
 Code. Figure 8.3 shows degrees of liquefaction hazards in the Town.

                                        8.0 PUBLIC SAFETY AND HAZARDS
8.1         INTRODUCTION
The Public Safety and Hazards chapter is designed to
establish policies and implementation programs that
will protect the Town from risks associated with
seismic, geologic, flood, fire and environmental hazards.
By identifying these hazards and the appropriate
abatement provisions, the Public Safety and Hazards
chapter will effectively reduce the potential for life
threatening, property damaging, and economically and
socially detrimental events. Hazards related to flooding
are addressed in Chapter 7, Flooding and Floodplain Management.
The state-required Noise and Safety Elements, included in this chapter, identify and
appraise noise and safety problems within the Town, are used as guides for establishing
land use patterns that minimize the exposure of Town residents to excessive natural and
man-made hazards.
8.2         REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE
Pursuant to California Government Code §65302g, the purpose of the Safety Element is to
provide information:
        “for the protection of the community from unreasonable risks associated with the
        effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, and
        dam failure; slope instability leading to landslides, subsidence and other geological
        hazards; flooding; hazardous material accidents; and wildland and urban fire.” The
        requirement to consider flooding hazards is addressed in Chapter 7 of the General
        Plan.
State law also requires preparation of a Noise Element, which must include recommended
land use compatibility standards for community noise environments, consistent with
Department of Health Service guidelines, pursuant to Health and Safety Code §46050.1.
GEOLOGY
The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (formerly the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies
Zone Act), signed into law in December 1972, requires the delineation of zones along active
faults in California. The purpose of the Alquist-Priolo Act is to regulate development on or
near active fault traces to reduce the hazard of fault rupture and to prohibit the location of
most structures for human occupancy across these traces. Cities and counties must regulate
certain development projects within the zones, which includes the withholding of permits
until geologic investigations demonstrate that development sites are not threatened by

 future surface displacement (Hart, 1997). Surface fault rupture is not necessarily restricted to
 the area within an Alquist-Priolo Zone. The project site is not located within an Alquist-
 Priolo Fault Rupture Zone.
 AIR QUALITY
 Federal Air Quality Programs
 Air pollution control and planning began in earnest in 1967 with the passage of the Federal
 Clean Air Act. In 1970 the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) was
 established for six pollutants. These pollutants are commonly referred to as "criteria"
 pollutants because criteria documents, which establish the relationship between exposure
 and effects on human health, have been prepared for each contaminant. The Act required
 states exceeding the NAAQS to prepare air quality plans showing how the standards were
 to be met by 1987. The Act was amended in 1977 and in 1990 to extend the deadline for
 compliance. Failure to submit and implement an acceptable plan meant a state could be
 denied federal highway funding.
 State Air Quality Programs
 In 1988 the California legislature passed the California Clean Air Act, which required air
 districts to develop air quality plans for the state standards. In general, the California Clean
 Air Act required the reduction of air pollutants by five percent or more per year, or the
 implementation of "all feasible measures" to meet the state air quality standards as
 expeditiously as possible.
 At the time of this General Plan, there are no regulations setting ambient air quality
 emissions standards for greenhouse gases, although the regulatory environment may
 change due to recent State legislation regarding climate change. Chapter 3 (Resource
 Conservation and Sustainability) provides an overview of climate change, and provides
 goals, policies, and implementation programs to mitigate GHG emissions in the Town.
 Regional Air Quality Programs
 The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) was established by the
 California Legislature to maintain and operate a regional air quality monitoring network to
 gauge progress toward attaining federal and state air quality standards. The BAAQMD rule
 Development Program develops and enforces regulations to maintain air quality. Land uses
 and activities that may cause air pollution must apply to the BAAQMD for air quality
 permits.

8.3          FIRE HAZARDS
The Town of Corte Madera faces an ongoing threat from urban and wildland fire, caused by
human activity and natural conditions. Wildland fire is a persistent threat to the hillside
residential neighborhoods in Corte Madera where the wildland and residential areas
intermix. The potential for wildland fires arises from the combination of ground cover and
vegetation, the combustibility of building materials, ground slope, weather patterns,
adequacy of access, water supply, and water pressure. Areas of heavy or unmanaged
vegetation increase the danger to people and structures from fire, a significant issue for
Corte Madera given the many adjoining open space preserves. The fuel load is particularly
high in the hillside residential areas. Structures built with combustible materials, such as
wood siding, shake roofs, and flammable landscaping heighten the vulnerability of
residents in hillside areas.
Once ignited, wildland fires can be difficult to contain. Hillside residents’ commitment to
fire safety is critical.
FIRE AND MEDICAL SERVICES
The Corte Madera Fire Department provides for the
safety, health, and well-being of all individuals, property,
and the environment through a comprehensive range of
programs designed to respond to threats from fire
hazards. Their primary activity is response to requests for
service, particularly medical assistance and structure
fires.    Other goals and objectives include disaster
preparedness and fire prevention through community
outreach and public education, training courses,
maintenance (roads, station upgrades), and annual
inspections of public and private property.
Fire Department personnel annually conduct fire inspections of every business in Corte
Madera. The Fire Department also works with the Marin Municipal Water District and the
Fire Flow Committee to continually upgrade water lines, supply, and hydrants throughout
the jurisdiction. Vehicle and equipment maintenance, as well as vigorous vegetation
management and fire road maintenance, are high priorities for the Fire Department. All fire
roads within the Town are surveyed annually in the spring in an effort to improve fire
protection in the wildland interface. The Marin Open Space District is responsible for
vegetation management of County open space lands in the Christmas Tree and
Meadowsweet areas, while the Corte Madera Fire Department is responsible for the open
space area by Ring Mountain.
Medical services in the Town are provided by the Corte Madera Fire Department. The
Department provides paramedic ambulance service, and has an agreement with the Ross
Corte Madera                                                                     General Plan

 Valley Paramedic Authority for additional service if needed. The primary hospitals in the
 area are Marin General in Larkspur and Kaiser Hospital in San Rafael.
 DISASTER COUNCIL
 Since the early 1990’s the Town has worked directly with residents to raise the level of
 community preparedness for major catastrophic events. In 1993 the Town Council
 established the Disaster Council made up of citizens, representatives of the business
 community and other organizations, and Town staff. The Disaster Council was initially
 charged with reviewing and updating the Town’s Emergency Operations Plan. The Disaster
 Council has been a forum for initiating programs that make the community better prepared
 for emergencies, including:
     ♦ The Disaster Preparedness Book, a handbook for residents that is distributed to all
         homes in the community.
     ♦ AM 1330, Town-owned radio broadcast station that can be used to give residents vital
         information during an emergency.
     ♦ The Town’s emergency siren which is used in a sudden emergency to alert residents to
         tune in AM 1330.

 EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS
 Many residents live in the wooded hillside areas to enjoy the pristine views and solitude.
 However, this can be in conflict with safety issues that may arise from a wildland fire or
 other natural disaster. One of the biggest challenges the Corte Madera Fire Department
 faces is adequate residential hillside access (ingress for emergency vehicles and egress for
 residents). Roads are narrow and often very steep, with sharp twists and turns. There are
 few pullouts for emergency vehicles, and if a disaster were to occur, a mass exodus could
 prevent emergency vehicle access altogether.
 Ongoing aggressive vegetation management is required by all hillside dwellers to prevent
 wildland fire. Unfortunately, this is not always adhered to because of the desire to preserve
 trees with the result that current fire loads are high. Residents can better protect and equip
 themselves in the event of a wildland fire by providing on-going yard and home
 maintenance, adhering to red flag days, and keeping scotch broom weeded. Hillside
 residents are encouraged to learn the trails and footpaths in their neighborhoods for use as
 alternative escape routes.

COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAINING (CERT)
Emergency preparedness planning recognizes that in the first 72 hours after a major disaster
residents must be self-sufficient. Disaster preparedness involves planning efforts by local
government, private organizations, and local groups to identify resources, provide public
awareness, and formulate plans about what to do in an emergency situation.
The Fire Department issues an Emergency Preparedness
Handbook in preparation for catastrophic events as part of
its disaster preparedness program and conducts two-day
Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) classes for
the general public and business community. The goal of this
program is to help the citizens of Corte Madera become self-
sufficient in the event of a major disaster by acquiring
hands-on disaster training. Emergency preparedness
training for Fire Department staff includes earthquake and
wildfire courses, paramedic training, Emergency Medical Technician training, confined
space rescue, wildland survival classes, and a multi-agency disaster drill.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTES
Hazardous materials consist of any substance which has the potential to cause injury, and
can include flammable liquids and gases, poisons, corrosives, explosives, radioactive
materials, and medical supplies and wastes.
The storage and clean-up (remediation) of hazardous sites is regulated by a series of federal,
state and local agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Cal EPA, the
State Department of Toxic Substance Control and Marin County’s Certified Unified
Program Agency (CUPA). Because of a general lack of significant industrial operations,
Corte Madera does not experience any significant threat from the use or storage of
hazardous materials. However, the State has identified over 20 hazardous waste sites in
Corte Madera, all of which involve issues of leaking underground storage tanks (LUST’s).
These are typically associated with past automobile-related activities, such as service
stations and automobile repair shops, and tend to be located in proximity to Highway 101,
including sites on Tamalpais Drive, Paradise Drive and Tamal Vista. The primary risk they
pose is leaking gasoline and diesel fuel hydrocarbons and related compounds into the soil
and groundwater. Most of the sites have undergone successful remediation (which usually
involves removal of the underground tanks and any contaminated soil). The State has
indicated that the remaining sites require no further investigation.
The transport of hazardous materials, particularly along the Highway 101 corridor, presents
possible hazards in the event of a materials leak or if a transport truck experiences an
accident. The Corte Madera Fire Department and CUPA hazards teams would respond to
any such incidents. The Hazardous Materials Management Plan for the Town identifies
places where flammable or toxic materials are used and stored, allowing appropriate
response to a fire or other emergency. Mutual aid agreements with other agencies also
expand the response capabilities for such emergencies.

8.5        NOISE
Noise in the community has often been cited as a health problem, not in terms of actual
physiological damages such as hearing impairment, but in terms of inhibiting general well-
being and contributing to undue stress and annoyance. The health effects of noise in the
community arise from interference with human activities such as sleep, speech, recreation
and tasks demanding concentration or coordination. When community noise interferes with
human activities or contributes to stress, public annoyance with the noise source increases
and the acceptability of the environment for people decreases. This decrease in acceptability
and the threat to public well-being are the basis for land use planning policies preventing
exposures to excessive community noise levels.
Many jurisdictions, including Corte Madera, have adopted community noise control
ordinances to control noise from fixed sources. Such ordinances are intended to abate noise
nuisances and to control noise from existing sources. They may also be used as performance
standards to judge the creation of a potential nuisance, or potential encroachment of
sensitive uses upon noise-producing facilities.
In very quiet environments, the introduction of virtually any        The “ambient” noise

planning and environmental review processes.                             environment.
The ambient noise environment in Corte Madera is defined primarily by traffic on Highway
101, which runs north and south through town. At locations removed from Highway 101,
the ambient noise environment tends to be defined by local traffic and typical neighborhood
noise sources. No significant noise-producing commercial or industrial activities are
identified within the Town of Corte Madera. The only concentration of such activities is in
proximity to Highway 101, which tends to mask noise generated by these sources.
FUNDAMENTALS OF NOISE
Noise is often described as unwanted sound, and is defined as any pressure variation in air
that the human ear can detect. If the pressure variations occur frequently enough (at least 20
times per second), they can be heard and hence are called sound. The number of pressure
variations per second is called the frequency of sound, and is expressed as cycles per
second, called Hertz (Hz).
Measuring sound directly in terms of pressure would require a very large and awkward
range of numbers. To avoid this, the decibel scale was devised. The decibel scale uses the
hearing threshold (20 micropascals) as a point of reference, defined as 0 dB. Other sound
pressures are then compared to the reference pressure, and the logarithm is taken to keep
the numbers in a practical range. The decibel scale allows a million-fold increase in pressure

 to be expressed as 120 dB. Another useful aspect of the decibel scale is that changes in levels
 (dB) correspond closely to human perception of relative loudness.
 The perceived loudness of sounds is dependent upon sound pressure level and frequency
 content. However, within the usual range of environmental noise levels, perception of
 loudness is relatively predictable, and can be approximated by weighing the frequency
 response of a sound level meter by means of the standardized A-weighing network. There is
 a strong correlation between A-weighted sound levels (expressed as dBA) and community
 response to noise. For this reason, the A-weighted sound level has become the standard tool
 of environmental noise assessment.
 Examples of A-weighted sound levels of some common noise sources:
         ♦ Soft whisper at 2 feet                               30 decibels
         ♦ Background noise in a residence                      40 decibels
         ♦ Open office background noise                         50 decibels
         ♦ Normal conversation at 5-10 feet                     60 decibels
         ♦ Commercial jet aircraft interior                     70 decibels
         ♦ Locomotive at 300 feet                               80 decibels
         ♦ Bulldozer at 50 feet                                 90 decibels
 Community noise is commonly described in terms of the “ambient” noise level, which is
 defined as the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given noise environment. A
 common statistical tool to measure the ambient noise level is the average, or equivalent,
 sound level (Leq), which corresponds to a steady-state A-weighted sound level containing
 the same total energy as a time-varying signal over a given time period (usually one hour).
 The Leq is the foundation of the composite noise descriptor, Ldn, and shows good
 correlation with community response to noise.
 The Day-Night Average Level (Ldn) is based upon the average noise level over a 24-hour
 day, with a +10 decibel weighing applied to noise occurring during nighttime (10:00 p.m. to
 7:00 a.m.) hours. The nighttime penalty is based upon the assumption that people react to
 nighttime noise exposures as though they were twice as loud as daytime exposures. Because
 Ldn represents a 24-hour average, it tends to disguise short-term variations in the noise
 environment.
 NOISE MITIGATION OPTIONS
 Noise problems have three basic elements: the noise source, a transmission path, and a
 receiver. The appropriate acoustical treatment for a given project depends on the nature of

the noise source and the sensitivity of the receiver. The problem should be defined in terms
of appropriate criteria (Ldn, Leq, or Lmax), the location of the sensitive receiver (inside or
outside), and when the problem occurs (daytime or nighttime). Noise control techniques
should then be selected to provide an acceptable noise environment for the receiving
property while remaining consistent with local aesthetic standards and practical structural
and economic limits. Fundamental noise control techniques include the use of setback areas,
physical noise barriers, incorporation of site design techniques (including placement and
uses of structures), building design, acoustical design of building facades, and placement of
site vegetation.
EXISTING NOISE ENVIRONMENT
Overview
The major noise source in Corte Madera is Highway 101; noise generated by traffic on local
streets and within neighborhood parks is considered secondary. There are no significant
sources of railroad, aircraft or industrial noise within the Town of Corte Madera. Noise
contours are shown on Figure 8.1.
Roadways
The Federal Highway Administration Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (FHWA-
RD-77-108) with vehicle noise emission curves was used to predict traffic noise levels within
Corte Madera Town Limits. The FHWA Model is the traffic noise prediction model
currently preferred by the Federal Highway Administration, the State of California
Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and most Town and county governments, for use
in traffic noise assessment. Although the FHWA Model is in the process of being updated
by a more sophisticated traffic noise prediction model, the use of RD-77-108 is considered
acceptable for the development of General Plan traffic noise predictions.

Non-Transportation Noise Sources
Noise is an inevitable by-product of many activities, even when the best available noise
control technology is applied. Although noise within industrial facilities is controlled by
Federal and State employee health and safety regulations (OSHA), exterior noise levels may
exceed locally acceptable standards. Commercial, recreational and public service facility
activities can also produce noise that affects adjacent sensitive land uses.
From a land use planning perspective, there are two goals for controlling fixed-source noise:
to prevent the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive areas, and to
prevent encroachment of noise-sensitive uses upon existing noise-producing facilities. The
first goal can be achieved by applying noise performance standards to proposed new noise-
producing uses. The second goal can be met by requiring that new noise-sensitive uses in
proximity to noise-producing facilities include mitigation measures to ensure compliance
with those noise performance standards.
Descriptions of some general types of existing fixed noise sources in the Town of Corte
Madera are provided below. These uses are intended to be representative of the relative
noise generation of such uses, and are intended to identify specific noise sources that should
be considered in the review of development proposals. Site-specific noise analyses should
be performed where noise sensitive land uses are proposed in proximity to these (or similar)
noise sources, or where similar sources are proposed to be located near noise-sensitive land
uses.
General Service Commercial and Light Industrial Uses
Noise sources associated with service commercial uses such as automotive and truck repair
facilities, tire installation centers, car washes, loading docks, corporation yards, etc., are
found within relative close proximity to Highway 101 within Town limits. The noise
emissions of these types of uses are dependant on many factors, and are therefore, difficult
to quantify precisely. Nonetheless, noise generated by the these uses contributes to the
ambient noise environment in the immediate vicinity of these uses, and should be
considered where either new noise-sensitive uses are proposed nearby or where similar uses
are proposed in existing residential areas.

 Parks and School Playing Fields
 Parks and school playgrounds, and their associated uses, are located throughout the Town.
 Noise generated by these uses depends on the age and number of people utilizing the
 respective facilities at a given time, and types of activities they are engaged in. School play
 field activities tend to generate more noise than those of neighborhood parks, because the
 intensity of school playground usage tends to be much higher. At a distance of 100 feet from
 an elementary school playground being used by 100 students, average and maximum noise
 levels of 60 and 75 dB, respectively, can be expected. At organized events such as high-
 school football games with large crowds and public address systems, the noise generation is
 often significantly higher. As with service commercial uses, the noise generation of parks
 and school playing fields is variable.
 Airports
 There are no airports or helipads within the general vicinity of the Town of Corte Madera.
 As a result, the existing ambient noise environment of the Town is not significantly
 influenced by aircraft noise, although aircraft fly-overs from other communities are possible.

     1) For traffic noise within Corte Madera, Ldn and peak-hour Leq values are estimated
         to be approximately similar. Interior noise level standards are applied within noise-
         sensitive areas of the various land uses, with windows and doors in the closed
         positions.
     2) Outdoor activity areas for single-family residential uses are defined as backyards.
         For large parcels or residences with no clearly defined outdoor activity area, the
         standard shall be applicable within a 100-foot radius of the residence.
     3) For multi-family residential uses, and for mixed-use projects that include residential
         units, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied at the common outdoor
         recreation area, such as at pools, play areas or tennis courts.
     4) Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Ldn or less
         using a practical application of the best-available noise reduction measures, an
         exterior noise level of up to 65 dB Ldn may be allowed provided that available
         exterior noise level reduction measures have been implemented and interior noise
         levels are in compliance with this table.

 8.7          GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
 TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY
 The topography of Corte Madera is varied, from the lowlands along the edge of the San
 Francisco Bay to the steeply sloping hillsides of residential neighborhoods on Chapman Hill
 and on Christmas Tree Hill along the Corte Madera Ridge.
 Three structural blocks, roughly separated by the active San Andreas and Hayward faults,
 characterize the geology of Marin County. Corte Madera lies within the San Francisco-
 Marin block, approximately nine miles northeast of the San Andreas Fault.
 Corte Madera is located on the Bay side of southern Marin County, which consists of two
 geological terrains: upland terrain of hills and ridges with steep slopes (such as the Corte
 Madera Ridge and residential neighborhoods leading up to Ring Mountain Preserve), and
 lowland terrain with subdivisions of valley lands and Bay lands. Different types of bedrock
 underlie the upland terrain. The Tiburon Peninsula Ridge (east of Highway 101) is topped
 by sheets of serpentine separated from the underlying sandstones and shale of Franciscan
 mélange. Mélange is composed of small to large hard rocks embedded in sheared and
 crushed rock. West of Highway 101 the ridges and knolls are made up of Franciscan
 sandstone. Mélange underlies some of the lower slopes in the older parts of Town.
 The valley lands have surface deposits of alluvium, which consists of clay, silt, sand, and
 gravel deposited by streams, and colluvium, which is deposits of unsorted soil material and
 rock fragments that accumulate at the base of slopes by gravity or landslide movement. The
 Bay lands are underlain by bedrock of the old valleys, now filled by sediments. Bay lands
 include Bay plains, marshes, and mudflats, which are primarily silt and clay transported by
 the Sacramento River and deposited by Bay tidewaters. These deposits are called Bay Mud.
 This soft mud is the most recent sediment deposited in the Bay. Corte Madera’s lowlands
 are characterized by contrasting extremes, with hard bedrock peninsulas and islands rising
 sharply out of Bay Mud marshlands. The lowland terrain also includes large areas of man-
 placed fill within the Bay lands.
 GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
 Slope Failure
 The major geologic- and soils-related hazards in Corte Madera are hill slope failure and
 static settlement of soils. Potential for hill slope failure, or landslide, depends upon the
 geologic composition of a slope. Certain combinations of rocks and soils are more stable
 than others, and hill slope failure can occur without an earthquake. Landslides involve the
 downslope movement of soil and rock; earthquake-induced landslides will most likely
 occur in the same areas where landslides are caused by other conditions. Unstable slopes
 and soils subject to static settlement can become more acute during an earthquake. The
 slopes of the Tiburon Peninsula Ridge, located east of Highway 101, are among the least
 stable areas. Changes made by man, such as excavating too steeply, undercutting slopes, or
General Plan                                                                      Corte Madera
                                                                                     April 2009

placing fills or structures on unstable slopes, may also induce landsliding. A large landslide
was induced west of Highway 101 by excavating Alto Hill during construction of the
highway. Scattered landslides have also occurred in the upland areas west of Highway 101.
Regional landslide mapping has indicated the presence of extensive slope stability hazards
in Corte Madera, with the hazard typically more pronounced on steeper slopes. The hazards
can include relatively large, loose debris flows. Generalized slope stability maps are shown
on Figure 8.2.
Subsidence
Static settlement, or subsidence, is a safety hazard in the lowland areas of Corte Madera. Much of
Corte Madera was built on fill deposited on Bay lands, such as marsh or tidelands. Bay Mud is soft,
unconsolidated and water-saturated clay that becomes compact under the weight of fill and urban
development. Bay Mud has severe stability problems because the mud is highly compressible.
When fills are placed over thick Bay Mud deposits, large amounts of settlement can take place over
long periods of time. Subsidence of Bay Mud is an on-going condition. This subsidence can subject
low-lying areas to frequent flooding due to differential settlement. Indeed, subsidence is one of the
major contributing factors to the steadily increasing flood hazard in Corte Madera.
The primary influence on the amount of subsidence at a given location is the thickness of the
underlying Bay Mud. The thicker the Bay Mud layer, the longer consolidation will take place with a
greater amount of subsidence. Bay Mud varies in thickness, so the amount of settlement varies
between areas. Differential settlement of Bay Mud in Corte Madera has resulted in reconstruction of
streets, sidewalks, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, and periodic maintenance of sewers and streets.
Seismic Hazards
Corte Madera is relatively close to known active earthquake faults, including the San
Andreas, Hayward, and Calaveras Faults. The Town is approximately eight miles northeast
of the San Andreas Fault zone and eleven miles southwest of the Hayward Fault zone.
While high magnitude earthquakes along these faults can be felt and can cause damage,
there are no direct reports of damage in Corte Madera as a result of major quakes. There are
no known active faults in Corte Madera, making ground rupture an unlikely hazard.
Nevertheless, the intense ground shaking poses a significant threat to life and property.
A critical factor affecting the intensity of ground shaking is the geologic material
underneath a site. Deep, loose soils, such as the clays and Bay Mud prevalent in the lowland
areas of Town, will amplify and prolong the shaking. The type of rock that least amplifies
ground shaking is granite. Ground shaking can be several times greater on sites underlain
by weak sediments, like Bay Mud, than on bedrock. Losses from shaking can occur where
tall structures are built on thick, soft sediments. Damage from shaking is also influenced by
the structural integrity of buildings before an earthquake. Damage to buildings and utilities
in the Town of Corte Madera is likely to be greatest on those sites underlain by deep, loose,
compressible deposits such as Bay Mud. These areas include the lowland residential
neighborhoods built on fill.

8.0 PUBLIC SAFETY AND HAZARDS
 Ground failure is a secondary effect of ground shaking and can include landslides,
 liquefaction, lurching, and differential settlement. Liquefaction occurs when saturated and
 poorly consolidated granular material is shaken during an earthquake and is transformed
 into a fluid-like state. Buildings can tilt or sink, utility lines can rise to the surface, and levees
 can fail. If soils are poorly consolidated, the ground can subside. Corte Madera faces the
 hazardous potential for liquefaction of man-placed fill and Bay Mud sediments.
 Neighborhoods built on filled Bay Mud are the most susceptible.
 The Town typically requires geotechnical investigations for new development, including
 single-family residences. Mitigation for new construction often includes installation of deep
 foundation support piers (anchored to bedrock), installation of appropriate drainage
 improvements around a structure, and seismic design pursuant to the Uniform Building
 Code. Figure 8.3 shows degrees of liquefaction hazards in the Town.

POLICY PSH – 8.3
Conduct landslide repair operations in conjunction with new development.
        Implementation Program PSH – 8.3.a: Landslide Mitigation
        Where known landslide areas exist, require comprehensive landslide mitigation
        actions to improve slope stability. This can include, with affected property owner
        support, landslide repair extending beyond the boundaries of a proposed
        development project site. As part of the review and approval of development and
        public works projects, the planting of vegetation on unstable slopes to protect
        structures at lower elevations or other appropriate measures shall be incorporated
        into the project design. Native plants may be required for landscaping in areas with
        landslide potential to eliminate the need for supplemental watering and to reduce
        the risk of landslide.
