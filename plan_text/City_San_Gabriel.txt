COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL PLAN OF THE CITY OF SAN GABRIEL, CALIFORNIA
                   ADOPTED BY RESOLUTION NO. 04-16, MAY 18, 2004

       LET YOUR IMAGINATION
                          RUN FREE.
  Imagine a San Gabriel the same, yet better: a San Gabriel of green, tree-
lined streets and sensitively designed neighborhoods. A walkable, livable
   San Gabriel where younger families can afford to live, with adequate
  places to play, the finest public and safety services, and a quality of life
                   unparalleled in the Los Angeles region.
 It’s not an impossibility. It is a challenge, one that begins with hundreds
   of residents participating in the process of defining that very future in
                         terms clear and compelling.
We believe that this San Gabriel is possible with much hard work and the
    commitment of San Gabriel’s residents. We hope you will join us in
 making your dream a reality. This booklet contains what we believe are
         the essential Ingredients for Success to make that happen.

                         II. FINDINGS OF THE CITY COUNCIL
11
                  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the City Council of the
12 City of San Gabriel as follows:
13
14                       A. ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINATION
15        Section 1.     Relationship of General Plan to Environmental
   Determination; Adequacy of Negative Declaration (Case No. PL-03-023). The
16
   Council HEREBY FINDS and DETERMINES, after reviewing and considering the
17 information in the draft negative declaration that:
18 a.     The draft comprehensive general plan proposes no increases in overall
          density, intensity or capacity beyond the numbers envisioned by the 1989
19        general plan and the implementing 1995 zoning consistency program.
20
          Rather, it imposes additional requirements relative to design review, traffic
          calming, community greening, economic development, impact fees and
21        other initiatives that refine the original plan with respect to quality of life
          measures and environmental protection. These changes significantly
22        increase the environmental protections associated with the plan. The initial
          study documents (Exhibit A) these facts in detail, and the initial study and
23
          negative declaration are incorporated into this resolution and made a part
24        hereof.
25
                                                  -3-
                                                                              Resolution No. 04-16
 1 b.     The draft comprehensive general plan does not propose additional general
          plan amendments or zone changes. Where potential future studies are
 2
          indicated, it is with the understanding that any resulting proposals will be
 3        subject to environmental review.
 4        Section 2. Adoption of Negative Declaration. The City Council HEREBY
   FINDS and DETERMINES that if the policies of the updated general plan are
 5 applied as provided in the text and maps of this plan, there shall be no significant
   adverse impact. The City Council THEREFORE ADOPTS the environmental
 6
   assessment, including the Background Report, Initial Study, and Negative
 7 Declaration in conjunction with approval of the plan.
 8        Section 3. Incorporation of Mitigation Measures. The City Council
   HEREBY FINDS and DETERMINES that the mitigation measures contained in the
 9
   mitigated negative declaration represent a reasonable effort to eliminate the
10 environmental consequences associated with implementation of the general plan.
   The Council HEREBY DIRECTS that all mitigation measures indicated in the
11 mitigated negative declaration be incorporated in the new general plan, and
   monitored as provided by the California Environmental Quality Act and City
12
   environmental guidelines.
13
14                         B. COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL PLAN
15        Section 4. Adoption of Draft General Plan. The City Council HEREBY
   APPROVES and ADOPTS the comprehensive revision of the San Gabriel general
16
   plan (Case No. PL-03-023), including text, graphics, and land use map as
17 presented at the public hearing of April 20, 2004. The City Council FURTHER
   DECLARES as follows:
18
   a.     Finding of Completeness and Adequacy. The adopted general plan
19
          contains a thorough and adequate treatment of land use, economic and
20
          development issues within the realm of general plan development. The
          general plan includes four new or expanded permissive elements not
21        previously available: community design, community facilities, cultural
          resources, and economic development.
22
   b.     Promotion of Public Health, Safety, and Welfare. The plan addresses
23
          long-term planning needs for the City’s public safety services, incorporating
24        new policies regarding police, fire and emergency services protection,
          defensible space design, and disaster preparedness. The plan further
25        increases housing opportunities through the identification of housing sites
                                                -4-
                                                                            Resolution No. 04-16

 1        and services, cooperative and sweat equity housing development, and
          specialized zoning controls for target housing and social service needs.
 2
 3 c.     Good City Planning Practices. The plan calls for improvements in the
          handling of new development by improving design standards,
 4        incorporating streetscape standards, traffic and transportation
          management, and other initiatives. The plan increases open space and
 5        recreation opportunities, incorporates a community “greening” program,
          recommends traffic calming and neighborhood protection strategies, and
 6
          offers new policies for the first time in the areas of cultural resource
 7        management, economic development, and community design.
 8 d.     Relationship to General Plan Environmental Determination. It is the
          intent of the Council that the general plan update and negative declaration
 9
          be seen as integrally related documents.
10
          1. The City Council DECLARES that every reasonable attempt has been
11            made to incorporate the issues, concerns and mitigation measures of the
              mitigated negative declaration into the general plan, and vice versa. In
12
              the event that by error or omission some issue, policy, mitigation
13
              measure or action has not been incorporated from the report into the
              general plan, the mitigation measure shall be presumed a part of the
14            general plan as if it had been separately adopted.
15        2. The City Council DECLARES that adoption of this general plan and
              mitigated negative declaration does not preclude the necessity or
16
              requirement for any further environmental review which would
17            normally be conducted in conjunction with project approvals under City
              of San Gabriel environmental guidelines.
18
          Section 5. Consistency with Recent Statutes. In adopting this general
19
   plan, the City Council HEREBY FINDS, DETERMINES, and DECLARES that
20 every reasonable effort has been made to incorporate recent legislation into the
   general plan. This includes the incorporation of specific provisions, goals,
21 objectives and policies as follows:
22 a.     Water. This includes water supplies, stormwater management and
          groundwater issues as required by recent legislation.
23
24 b.     Child Care, Social Services, and the Homeless. The general plan, as
          adopted by Council, contains a series of specific objectives and policies with
25
                                                 -5-
                                                                               Resolution No. 04-16

 1        respect to the provision of child care, social services, and the homeless as
          provided by relevant provisions of State law.
 2
 3 c.     Environmental Review. The adopted general plan is consistent with the
          provisions of Assembly Bill 3180 (1988) in that it incorporates specific
 4        mitigation measures directly into the draft general plan. The Council
          DECLARES that the Community Development Director or his designee
 5        shall be the primary party responsible for successful completion of the
 6
          mitigation measures specified in the plan. The Community Development
          Department shall file an annual report with the governing body
 7        demonstrating progress toward implementation of the plan.
 8 d.     Housing. The general plan, through its housing element, provides
          objectives, quantified targets, and specific policies for development of
 9
          municipal housing programs consistent with State law. The Housing
10        Element has been certified by the California Department of Housing and
          Community Development.
11
   e.     Environmental Goals and Policy Report. To the extent possible, this plan is
12
          designed to be responsive to the broad environmental, economic and equity
13        goals of the state Environmental Goals and Policy Report as released by the
          Governor’s Office of Planning and Research.
14
          Section 6. Consistency with Regional Plans. The City Council FINDS and
15 DECLARES that through its efforts to reduce vehicle trips, promote walkability ,
   preserve and protect critical watercourses and embrace sustainable technologies,
16
   the plan is consistent with:
17
   a.      The regional Air Quality Management Plan of the South Coast Air Quality
18         Management District;
19
   b.      The Southern California Association of Governments Regional
20         Comprehensive Plan,
21 c.      Applicable adopted Airport Land Use Plans, in that no facility subject to an
           Airport Land Use Plan is located in or adjoining the City of San Gabriel.
22
23 The Council FURTHER FINDS and DETERMINES that the plan as adopted
   reaffirms, and is materially consistent with, the regional plan for the San Gabriel
24 River Basin prepared by the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and
   Mountains Conservancy, and known by the name “Common Ground.”
25
                                                -6-
                                                                             Resolution No. 04-16

 1        Section 7. Relationship to “One City, One Future”. The City Council
   recognizes the importance of organizational strategic planning. In adherence to
 2
   the fundamental tenets of the City’s “One City, One Future” process, the plan has
 3 been updated wherever possible to incorporate goals and objectives expressed
   through the City’s organizational strategic planning process.
 4
          Section 8. Public Comment. The City Council AFFIRMS that it
 5 considered, to the best of its ability, all public testimony and all relevant
 6
   information provided to it; and that the general plan adopted by this resolution
   represents its best effort to accommodate the diverse and competing needs of
 7 residents, property owners, and social and economic components of the City’s
   population and workforce.
 8
          Section 9. Entirety of Plan. The Council, in adopting this plan, adopts
 9
   each and every component of the plan as presented, including the Background
10 Report and Technical Appendices; the Land Use Map; the Policy Report; the

11 integrated unit.

   issues, technological, environmental, economic, and demographic changes that
15 have affected San Gabriel since the 1989 plan was adopted; and
16        WHEREAS, subsequent analyses prepared by both the Community

17
   plan required many other technical modifications; and
18
          WHEREAS, the Planning Commission finds that further development

                  II. FINDINGS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION
 9
10
                  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Planning
11 Commission of the City of San Gabriel as follows:
12
13
                         A. ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINATION
14        Section 1.     Relationship of General Plan to Environmental
   Determination; Adequacy of Negative Declaration (Case No. PL-03-023). The
15 Planning Commission HEREBY RECOMMENDS that the Council FIND and
   DETERMINE, after reviewing and considering the information in the draft
16
   negative declaration that:
17
   a.     The draft comprehensive general plan proposes no increases in overall
18        density, intensity or capacity beyond the numbers envisioned by the 1989
          general plan and the implementing 1995 zoning consistency program.
19        Rather, it imposes additional requirements relative to design review, traffic
20
          calming, community greening, economic development, impact fees and
          other initiatives that refine the original plan with respect to quality of life
21        measures and environmental protection. These changes significantly
          increase the environmental protections associated with the plan. The initial
22        study documents (Exhibit A) these facts in detail, and the initial study and
          negative declaration are incorporated into this resolution and made a part
23
          hereof.
24
   b.     The draft comprehensive general plan does not propose additional general
25        plan amendments or zone changes. Where potential future studies are
                                                  -3-
                                                                                Resolution No. 04-01

 1        indicated, it is with the understanding that any resulting proposals will be
          subject to full environmental review.
 2
 3         Section 2. Adoption of Negative Declaration. The Planning Commission
   HEREBY FINDS and DETERMINES that if the policies of the updated general plan
 4 are applied as provided in the text and maps of this plan, there shall be no
   significant adverse impact. The Planning Commission THEREFORE
 5 RECOMMENDS that the Negative Declaration and all appurtenant mitigation
   measures be adopted.
 6
 7         Section 3. Incorporation of Mitigation Measures. The Planning
   Commission RECOMMENDS that the City Council FIND and DETERMINE that
 8 the mitigation measures contained in the mitigated negative declaration represent
   a reasonable effort to eliminate the environmental consequences associated with
 9
   implementation of the general plan. The Planning Commission HEREBY
10 RECOMMENDS that the Council DIRECT that all mitigation measures indicated
   in the mitigated negative declaration be incorporated in the new general plan.
11
12                         B. COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL PLAN
13
           Section 4. Adoption of Draft General Plan. The Planning Commission
14 HEREBY RECOMMENDS that the City Council APPROVE and ADOPT the
   comprehensive revision of the San Gabriel general plan (Case No. PL-03-023),
15 including text, graphics, and land use map as presented at the public hearing of
   March 8, 2004. The Planning Commission FURTHER RECOMMENDS that the
16
   Council DECLARE that:
17
   a.      Finding of Completeness and Adequacy. The adopted general plan
18         contains a thorough and adequate treatment of land use, economic and
           development issues within the realm of general plan development. The
19
           general plan includes four new or expanded permissive elements not
20
           previously available: community design, community facilities, cultural
           resources, and economic development.
21
   b.      Promotion of Public Health, Safety, and Welfare. The plan addresses
22         long-term planning needs for the City’s public safety services, incorporating
           new policies regarding police, fire and emergency services protection,
23
           defensible space design, and disaster preparedness. The plan further
24         increases housing opportunities through the identification of housing sites
           and services, cooperative and sweat equity housing development, and
25         specialized zoning controls for target housing and social service needs.
                                                -4-
                                                                              Resolution No. 04-01

 1
   c.     Good City Planning Practices. The plan calls for improvements in the
 2
          handling of new development by improving design standards,
 3        incorporating streetscape standards, traffic and transportation
          management, and other initiatives. The plan increases open space and
 4        recreation opportunities, incorporates a community “greening” program,
          recommends traffic calming and neighborhood protection strategies, and
 5        offers new policies for the first time in the areas of cultural resource
          management, economic development, and community design.
 6
 7 d.     Relationship to General Plan Environmental Determination. It is the
          intent of the Planning Commission that the general plan update and
 8        negative declaration be seen as integrally related documents.
 9
          1.     The Planning Commission RECOMMENDS that the Council
10               DECLARE that every reasonable attempt has been made to
                 incorporate the issues, concerns and mitigation measures of the
11               mitigated negative declaration into the general plan, and vice versa.
                 In the event that by error or omission some issue, policy, mitigation
12
                 measure or action has not been incorporated from the report into the
13
                 general plan, the mitigation measure shall be presumed a part of the
                 general plan as if it had been separately adopted.
14
              2. The Planning Commission RECOMMENDS that the Council
15               DECLARE that adoption of this general plan and mitigated negative
                 declaration does not preclude the necessity or requirement for any
16
                 further environmental review which would normally be conducted
17               in conjunction with project approvals under City of San Gabriel
                 environmental guidelines.
18
          Section 5. Consistency with Recent Statutes. In adopting this general
19
   plan, the Planning Commission HEREBY RECOMMENDS that the Council
20 HEREBY FIND, DETERMINE, and DECLARE that every reasonable effort has
   been made to incorporate recent legislation into the general plan. This includes
21 the incorporation of specific provisions, goals, objectives and policies as follows:
22 a.     Water. This includes water supplies, stormwater management and
          groundwater issues as required by recent legislation.
23
24 b.     Child Care, Social Services, and the Homeless. The general plan, as
          adopted by Council, contains a series of specific objectives and policies with
25
                                                 -5-
                                                                                Resolution No. 04-01

 1        respect to the provision of child care, social services, and the homeless as
          provided by relevant provisions of State law.
 2
 3 c.     Environmental Review. The adopted general plan is consistent with the
          provisions of Assembly Bill 3180 (1988) in that it incorporates specific
 4        mitigation measures directly into the draft general plan. The Planning
          Commission FURTHER RECOMMENDS that the Council DECLARE that
 5        the Community Development Director or his designee shall be the primary
 6
          party responsible for successful completion of the mitigation measures
          specified in the plan. The Community Development Department shall file
 7        an annual report with the governing body demonstrating progress toward
          implementation of the plan.
 8
   d.     Housing. The general plan, through its housing element, provides
 9
          objectives, quantified targets, and specific policies for development of
10        municipal housing programs consistent with State law. The Housing
          Element has been certified by the California Department of Housing and
11        Community Development; the full text of the plan as approved and certified
          is incorporated herein and made a part hereof.
12
13 e.     Environmental Goals and Policy Report. To the extent possible, this plan is
          designed to be responsive to the broad environmental, economic and equity
14        goals of the state Environmental Goals and Policy Report as released by the
          Governor’s Office of Planning and Research.
15
          Section 6. Adoption by Reference of the Los Angeles County Hazardous
16
   Waste Management Plan. The Planning Commission HEREBY RECOMMENDS
17 that the City Council ADOPT the Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste
   Management Plan, and DIRECT that it be incorporated by reference into the San
18 Gabriel general plan. The Planning Commission FURTHER RECOMMENDS that
   the Council FIND that the general plan is consistent with the intent of the
19
   Hazardous Waste Management Plan by ensuring that the City of San Gabriel
20 accepts its fair share of responsibility for the provision of critical regional facilities.
   The plan provides additionally for development of stringent local policies
21 concerning the development of these facilities.
22        Section 7. Adoption by Reference of the Regional Air Quality
23
   Management Plan of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. The
   Planning Commission HEREBY RECOMMENDS that the City Council ADOPT the
24 Regional Air Quality Management Plan, and DIRECT that it be incorporated by
   reference into the San Gabriel general plan. In making this recommendation, the
25 Planning Commission intends that in the event any conflict exists between the
                                                  -6-
                                                                                 Resolution No. 04-01

 1 general plan and the air quality plan, the more precise language of the general
   plan shall prevail.

 3         Section 8. Direction Concerning the Parks and Recreation Facilities
   Master Development program. The Planning Commission HEREBY
 4 RECOMMENDS that the Council authorize development, subject to budget
   authorization and sufficient funding, of a Parks and Recreation Facilities Master
 5 Development Program, prepared as a companion document, which is consistent
   with all relevant provisions of the general plan. The Planning Commission
 6
   HEREBY RECOMMENDS that the Council DIRECT that the Parks and Recreation
 7 Facilities Master Development Program be incorporated into the general plan by
   reference.
 8
           Section 9. Adoption by Reference of Common Ground and Finding of
 9
   Consistency. The Planning Commission HEREBY RECOMMENDS that the
10 Council reaffirm its previous support of the regional river master plan known as
   Common Ground (San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains
11 Conservancy), and FINDS that the San Gabriel general plan is materially
   consistent with that document.
12
13
           Section 10. Relationship to “One City, One Future”. The Planning
   Commission recognizes the importance of organizational strategic planning. In
14 adherence to the fundamental tenets of the City’s “One City, One Future” process,
   the plan has been updated wherever possible to incorporate goals and objectives
15 expressed through the City’s organizational strategic planning process.
16
           Section 11. Public Comment. The Planning Commission HEREBY
17 RECOMMENDS that the Council AFFIRM that it considered, to the best of its
   ability, all public testimony and all relevant information provided to it; and that
18 the general plan adopted by this resolution represents its best effort to
   accommodate the diverse and competing needs of residents, property owners, and
19
   social and economic components of the City’s population and workforce.
20
           Section 12. Passage and Adoption of the General Plan Map. The
21 Planning Commission HEREBY RECOMMENDS that the Council adopt the
   General Plan Map (attached to this resolution and made a part hereof); and directs

25 Resolution, and thereupon the same shall take effect and be in force.

Letter of Transmittal
March, 2004
Honorable Mayor Baldwin and
Members of the City Council:
S
       an Gabriel is a most wondrous community in which to live. Rich with the wealth
       of diverse cultures, historic resources, remarkable and well-kept residential areas,
       and a spirited people, there is no reason why San Gabriel should not – cannot –
become the success story of the next decade.
That’s why the general plan process has taken on such importance. San Gabriel is, in
many ways, at a critical crossroads during which it can determine for itself whether its
star remains in the ascendancy, or whether the community will experience the types of
slow diminution that face other communities that do not address critical quality of life
issues. The commitment of the City Council to this process is evidence that San Gabriel
aspires to be the best community it can be, and the comprehensive planning process set
by state law is the best means to identify a long-term vision for San Gabriel that
translates into meaningful improvement.
This general plan is unique, and not just for San Gabriel – which historically has not
been able to invest the time and resources in a general plan that the city truly requires.
It is unique in that the plan does more than plan minimally for the basic land use
requirements of a growing city. For the first time, the plan before you focuses on a
dozen or so initiatives that represent real improvements in the quality of life for San
Gabriel residents.
       In Chapter 3, you will see how the City is taking the dilemma of traffic by the
        horns, and creating an effective array of strategies to combat congestion.
       In Chapter 4, you can learn about San Gabriel’s economic development strategy,
        and how those efforts are being designed to ensure a higher quality of life for all.
       In Chapters 7, 8 and 10, you will see how developing a greener, more livable,
        and more environmentally sustainable city is incorporated into every aspect of
        the City’s processes, from subdivisions and development review to zoning and
        redevelopment.

In order to make adequate provision for the housing
needs of all segments of the community, the City must
ensure equal and fair housing opportunities are available
to all residents. The Housing Element seeks to expand
the range of housing opportunities provided in San
Gabriel, including the housing for those with "special
needs", including senior citizens on fixed incomes, very
low-, low-, and moderate-income residents, the disabled,
large families, female-headed households with children,
and the homeless.

                    opportunities accessible to
                    employment centers, quality

IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
10.1     Establish the goals and policies of this Chapter as
         establishing a basic set of design principles to be
         in effect until such time as the zoning ordinance
         and design guidelines are in place with more
         specific language.
10.2.    Require the Design Review Commission or other
         body to conduct an annual review of
         improvements required under this general plan,
         and report its findings to the Council no later than
         January 1 of each year.
10.3     Adopt the Design Guidelines for commercial,
         residential, institutional and other projects as
         recommended by this plan, and empower the
         DRC to review and recommend improvements to
         those guidelines as needed.
10.4     Adopt the proposed street tree master plan and       San Gabriel’s proposed street tree master plan will identify

            drawn from the City’s proposed Residential
            Design Guidelines. The City of San Gabriel
            adopts these seven principles as the guiding
principles for new residential development in the city.
1. Shelter
Sloped roofs, and small-scaled porches or entry
alcoves, should generally be used to express the
sheltering character of houses.
2. Balance
House massing and site design should maintain pleasing
proportions, and should balance mass with setback and
screening, avoiding monumental
symmetry.
                                                                A sense of anticipation when approaching a gate, the

Integrity of house and site design should allow durable
design features to resonate, establish rhythm, and to be
carried forward to all views as appropriate.
4. Detail
Detail shall be used as essential small-scale elements of
house character.
5. Substance
Dimensions shall be given to design elements -- to give
the house the appearance of structural substance; to
select a tree or bench light enough to avoid
overpowering a garden -- as appropriate to the setting.

Principles
1. Balance
Building massing and site design should reinforce a sense of
balance, scale, and proportion within the project and within
the immediate neighborhood context.
2. Rhythm
Repetition of major elements should establish a rhythm,
and should generally not exceed seven in number, to
avoid monotony.
3. Integrity
Integrity of building and site design should allow durable
design features to resonate, and to be carried forward to all
views as appropriate.
4. Detail
Detail and vertical graduation shall be used as appropriate to
the scale and character of the project and
surroundings, and integrally designed to avoid a generic,
applied, appearance.

I.       Introduction
                                               The City of San Gabriel is located in the western portion
                                               of the San Gabriel Valley, approximately ten miles to the
                                               northeast of Downtown Los Angeles. The City occupies
                                               an area of slightly over 4 square miles and is home to
                                               approximately 40,000 residents. The City is bordered on
                                               the north by San Marino; on the west by Alhambra; on
                                               the south and southeast by Rosemead; and on the east
                                               by Temple City and an unincorporated portion of Los
Angeles County. The City's official boundaries stretch eastwards through the unincorporated area
in irregular corridors along Las Tunas Drive and Broadway. Figure I-1 depicts San Gabriel's
regional location and City boundaries respectively.
The development and improvement of housing is an important goal of the City of San Gabriel. To
achieve this goal, a comprehensive housing plan is needed. This document constitutes the Housing
Element of the San Gabriel General Plan. It sets forth the City's strategy to preserve and enhance
the community's residential character, expand housing opportunities for all economic segments,
and provide guidance and direction for local government decision-making in all matters relating to
housing.
A.       Role of the Housing Element
         “The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment of
         decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a priority of
         the highest order.”
                                           California Government Code, §65580
The Housing Element has two purposes:
         •       to provide an assessment of current and future housing needs, and the constraints
                 in and resources for meeting those needs; and
         •       to provide a comprehensive strategy that establishes housing goals, policies, and
                 programs.
State law requires Housing Elements to be updated at least every six years to reflect a community's
changing housing needs. The San Gabriel Housing Element was last updated in 2010 and this
update covers the 2013-2021 planning period.

Housing Element                           September 2013
B.       Content of the Housing Element
The San Gabriel Housing Element is comprised of the following major components:
         •       An analysis of the City population, household and employment base, the
                 characteristics of the City housing stock, and a summary of the present and
                 projected housing needs of households in the City (Chapter II).
         •       A review of potential constraints to meeting the City's identified housing needs
                 (Chapter III).
         •       An evaluation of opportunities that will further the development of new housing
                 (Chapter IV).
         •       A statement of the Housing Plan to address the City’s identified housing needs,
                 including housing goals, policies and programs (Chapter V).
C.       Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The City of San Gabriel General Plan is comprised of the following seven elements: 1) Land Use;
2) Mobility; 3) Safety; 4) Noise; 5) Housing; 6) Conservation (Environmental Resources) and 7)
Open Space. The Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements and is entirely
consistent with the policies and proposals set forth by the Plan. This Housing Element proposes
no land use or policy change that would result in inconsistency among the different elements. As
portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, the City will review the Housing Element
for internal consistency, and make any necessary revisions.
D.       Public Participation
The City of San Gabriel encourages the participation of its residents, community groups, and local
agencies to help develop the Housing Element. During the development of the Housing Element,
the City consulted with and/or obtained information from a variety of organizations serving lower-
and moderate-income residents and those with special needs. These include:
         •       Los Angeles County Community Development Commission (LACDC)/Housing
                 Authority
         •       Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA)
In addition to consultation with the organizations listed above, the City’s community outreach
effort also included the following mediums:
         •       Cable TV Scroll
         •       City Website
         •       Press Releases to mainstream and non-English language print and electronic news
                 outlets
City residents as well as representatives of concerned organizations have had several opportunities
to recommend strategies, review, and comment on the San Gabriel Housing Element. These

Housing Element                                                                       September 2013

included meetings of the Planning Commission and City Council in May 2013 open to the public
during the development of the Element. Notice was publicized in local newspapers and posted at
City Hall, the Fire Station Headquarters, and the U.S. Post Office prior to the sessions. The public
input collected at the meetings is summarized in Appendix C and has been incorporated into the
Housing Element.
The draft Housing Element was also made available for public review at the San Gabriel City Hall
and the public library. Also, to encourage the participation of community groups and agencies that
serve low- and moderate-income populations and those with special needs, a variety of groups in
addition to the organizations listed previously were invited to participate through direct mailing of
the meeting notice (please refer to Appendix C for a complete listing of agencies that were invited
to participate).
Public input has been incorporated into the draft Element for review by the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD). Prior to adoption of the Housing Element, public
hearings were held before the Planning Commission and City Council. Notices were published in
local newspapers in advance of each hearing and copies of the draft Element were made available
for public review at City Hall, the public library, and other public locations in San Gabriel.
Appendix C provides a summary of the comments and suggestions offered during the preparation
and review of this Housing Element.

II.      Housing Needs Assessment
San Gabriel lies in southern Los Angeles County, approximately ten miles east of the City of Los
Angeles. Spanish colonial history of the City of San Gabriel dates back to 1771 with the founding
of the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel, a California State historical landmark. By 1852, after
American occupation, San Gabriel became one of the first townships in the County of Los
Angeles. When the 1860 census was taken, there were 586 persons listed. The city was
incorporated as a general law city on April 24, 1913 with a population of 1,500. San Gabriel has a
population of approximately 40,000 today. San Gabriel is approximately 4.1 square miles in area
and is surrounded by the cities of San Marino to the north and northwest, Alhambra to the west,
Rosemead to the south, Temple City to the east, and unincorporated Los Angeles County to the
northeast. The population’s median household income in 2010 was $57,666. The 2010 Census
indicated San Gabriel's median household income was 2% greater than that of Los Angeles
County ($56,266) and 6% less than California as a whole ($61,632).
This chapter examines general population and household characteristics and trends, such as age,
race and ethnicity, employment, household composition and size, household income, and special
needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g., number of units and type, tenure, age and
condition, costs) are also addressed. Finally, the City’s projected housing growth needs based on
the 2014-2021 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) are examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent data from the U.S. Census, California
Department of Finance (DOF), California Employment Development Department (EDD),
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and other relevant sources.
Supplemental data was obtained through field surveys and from private sources. Unless noted
otherwise, all tables represent data for the City of San Gabriel.
A.       Population Characteristics
         1.      Population Growth Trends
San Gabriel was incorporated in 1913 with a population of 1,500. From 1990-2000, the
population grew by approximately 7.2%. From 2000 to 2012 the city grew by just 0.3% to an
estimated population of 39,926 (see Table II-1 and Figure II-1). The city’s 2012 population
represents approximately 0.4% of the county’s total population of 9,818,605.

         2.        Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age groups
require different accommodations based on lifestyle, family type, income level, and housing
preference. Table II-2 provides a comparison of the city’s and county’s population by age group in
2010. This table shows that the age distribution of the city’s population is similar to Los Angeles
County as a whole. The median age of the city’s population is approximately 5.5 years higher than
the county median.

B.       Household Characteristics
         1.       Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing needed in a city.
The Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing unit, which may include
single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated persons
sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as dormitories, retirement or convalescent
homes, or other group living situations are included in population totals, but are not considered
households.
Table II-4 provides a comparison of households by type for the city and Los Angeles County as a
whole, as reported in the 2010 Census. Family households comprised approximately 76% of all
households in the city, somewhat higher than the county, where family households make up
approximately 68% of all households. Other differences include non-family households (24% city
vs. 32% county) and householders living alone (17% city vs. 24% county). The city’s average
household size of 3.13 is slightly higher than Los Angeles County as a whole (2.99). These statistics
suggest that that the need for large units in San Gabriel may be slightly higher than other areas of
the county.

          2.         Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market. Communities
need an adequate supply of units available both for rent and for sale in order to accommodate a
range of households with varying income, family size and composition, and lifestyle. Table II-5
provides a comparison of the number of owner-occupied and renter-occupied units in the city in
2010 as compared to the county as a whole. It reveals that the level of homeownership for the city
(47%) is slightly higher than the county as a whole (45%).

         3.         Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The U.S.
Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than one person per
room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding occurring when there are
more than 1.5 occupants per room. Table II-6 summarizes recent overcrowding for the City of San
Gabriel.

Overcrowding was more prevalent among renters than for owner-occupied units. Approximately
15% of the city’s renter-occupied households were overcrowded compared to about 6% of owner-
occupied households.
         4.       Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community. According to
recent Census estimates, the median household income in San Gabriel was $56,720,
approximately 2% higher than the Los Angeles County median income of $55,476 (Table II-7).

AB 2634 of 2006 added the requirement to consider the needs of extremely-low-income (ELI)
households in preparing Housing Elements. Extremely-low-income is defined as gross household
income of 30% or less of the county median. These households face the greatest challenges in
finding affordable housing and other services. In San Gabriel, a number of Housing Element
programs (see Chapter V) address the needs of ELI residents, including Program 1 - Senior
Housing and Second Units; Program 2 - Emergency Shelters, Transitional and Supportive
Housing; Program 7 – Section 8 Rental Assistance; Program 9 – Preservation of Existing Rental
Housing; Program 12 – Preservation of Assisted Housing; and Program 15 – Housing Information
and Referral Services.
         5.       Overpayment
According to State housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of gross
household income. Table II-8 displays recent estimates for overpayment by lower-income
households. According to Census estimates, 84% of all lower-income renter households and 60%
of all lower-income owner households in San Gabriel were overpaying for housing. Very-low- and
extremely-low-income renters appeared to suffer the greatest cost burden, with over 90% of
households in these categories overpaying for housing. While these statistics show higher rates of
overpayment than reported in the prior Housing Element, it is difficult to determine the reasons
for the increase, which could include rising rents, incomes not keeping pace with housing costs, or
statistical differences in data sources (e.g., 2000 Census vs. ACS) and methodologies.

Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other benefits that help to
compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to defer maintenance or
repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For lower-income renters, severe cost
burden can require families to double up resulting in overcrowding and related problems.
C.       Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. While people in
the Los Angeles area frequently work outside their community of residence, the type of jobs
available in each community and the wages for these jobs will affect the type and size of housing
residents can afford.
         1.      Current Employment
Current employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing needs
during this planning period. Table II-9 shows that the city had a workforce of 20,522 persons, or
62% of the working-age population, as reported in recent Census estimates. This table shows that
the characteristics of the city’s population are similar to those countywide. For example, the
proportion of the working age population in the labor force for San Gabriel is about 3% lower
than that of the county. Approximately 62% of those aged 16 and over were in the labor force.

Census estimates reported that approximately 34% of the city’s working residents were employed
in management and professional occupations (Table II-10). A significant percentage of workers
(28%) were employed in sales and office related occupations. Approximately 21% were employed
in service related occupations such as waiters, waitresses and beauticians. Blue collar occupations
such as machine operators, assemblers, farming, transportation, handlers and laborers constituted
approximately 17% of the workforce.

         2.      Projected Job Growth
Future housing needs are affected by the number and type of new jobs created during this
planning period. Table II-11 shows projected job growth by industry for the Los Angeles-Long
Beach-Glendale MSA (Los Angeles County) for the period 2010-2020. Total employment in Los
Angeles County is expected to grow by 15.5% between 2010 and 2020. The overall growth is
expected to add more than 657,000 new jobs and bring the employment of Los Angeles County to
about 4.9 million by 2020.
Generally, residents that are employed in well-paying occupations have less difficulty obtaining
adequate housing than residents in low paying occupations. Table II-11 illustrates the growth trend

in low-wage service jobs such as health care support, food preparation and serving, cleaning and
maintenance, sales, and office/administrative support.
According to the Census Bureau, about 95% of employed San Gabriel residents worked in Los
Angeles County, and approximately 16% of all workers were employed within the city limits (Table
II-12).

D.       Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing stock and
helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the number and type of
housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure, vacancy, housing costs,
affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to conversion to market-rate. A
housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile home, or group of rooms, occupied as
separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters.
         1.      Housing Type and Growth Trends
The California Department of Finance reported that as of 2012, the housing stock in San Gabriel
was comprised mostly of single-family homes, which made up about 67% of all units, while multi-
family units comprised about 33% of the total. Table II-13 provides a breakdown of the housing
stock by type along with growth trends for the city compared to the county as a whole for the
period 2000-2012. It is important to note that comparisons between years or jurisdictions may be
unreliable due to different reporting methodologies, such as whether attached condominium units
are reported as single-family or multi-family.

         2.      Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior to
1978 before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed may have interior or
exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built before 1970 are
the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in a deteriorated condition.
Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age six and to pregnant women when it
peels off walls or is pulverized by windows and doors opening and closing.
Table II-14 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in San Gabriel compared to Los
Angeles County as a whole.

This table shows that the majority of the housing units in San Gabriel were constructed prior to
1970 (80%). These findings suggest that there may be a need for maintenance and rehabilitation,
including remediation of lead-based paint, for a large portion of the city’s housing stock.
The most recent focused research regarding housing units in need of rehabilitation or replacement
was prepared in 2002. At that time, it was estimated that approximately 3,000 units in the city may
be substandard in at least one respect. This represented approximately one-third of units built
prior to 1970. The City’s Neighborhood Improvement Services Division, which handles code
enforcement, currently estimates that housing stock conditions are not substantially different than
in 2002. Although the strong housing market during 2002-2006 encouraged many property
owners to make repairs and improvements based on rising property values and rents, the economic
downturn since 2007 has probably had the opposite effect. Therefore, the current estimate of
housing units in need of repair or replacement continues to be 3,000, unchanged from 2002 based
on the professional judgment of City staff who are in the field regularly. When code violations or
substandard properties are observed, code enforcement personnel provide property owners with
information on available programs to assist with needed repairs.
         3.      Vacancy
Housing occupancy statistics rates as reported by the Census Bureau are shown in Table II-15. The
table shows that vacancy rates in the city were relatively low, with 5.7% of rental units and 1.0% of
owner units vacant. The vacancy rate for the county as a whole closely matched the city with a
5.8% rental vacancy rate and a 1.7% owner vacancy rate. A rental vacancy rate in the 5% range is
considered a healthy market condition allowing for tenant mobility.

         4.        Housing Cost
a.       Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on the area
(i.e., county) median income (“AMI”): extremely-low (30% or less of AMI), very-low (31-50% of
AMI), low (51-80% of AMI), moderate (81-120% of AMI) and above moderate (over 120% of
AMI). Housing affordability is based on the relationship between household income and housing
expenses. According to HUD and the California Department of Housing and Community
Development 1, housing is considered “affordable” if the monthly payment is no more than 30% of
a household’s gross income. In some areas (such as Los Angeles County), these income limits may
be increased to adjust for high housing costs.
Table II-16 shows 2013 affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for housing
in San Gabriel (and Los Angeles County) 2 by income category. Based on state-adopted standards,
the maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households is $640, while the
maximum affordable rent for very-low-income households is $1,068. The maximum affordable
rent for low-income households is $1,708, while the maximum for moderate-income households is
$1,944.

Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage interest
rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments, homeowner association
fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the maximum home purchase prices by
income category shown in Table II-16 have been estimated based on typical conditions.

b.         For-Sale Housing
Housing sales price statistics for the year 2012 (Table II-17) show that the median price of single-
family detached homes in San Gabriel ranged from $418,000 to $575,000 depending on zip code,
while median condo prices ranged from $350,000 to $457,000 during this period. These median
prices were significantly higher than for Los Angeles County as a whole.

Based on the estimated affordable purchase prices shown in Table II-16, it is unlikely that many
single-family detached homes were affordable to lower-income or moderate-income homebuyers.
These data illustrate that large public subsidies are generally required to reduce sales prices to a
level that is affordable to lower-income buyers. At a median price of about $400,000 for
condominiums, there is a “gap” of about $100,000 between the market price and the maximum
price a moderate-income household can afford to pay for a home, under typical financing terms.
For low-income households, this gap is about $150,000. Chapter V describes the City’s programs
to assist families in finding affordable housing options.

c.       Rental Housing
A rental survey of apartments and condos advertised in San Gabriel found that the rents ranged
from $950 for a studio unit to $3,500 for a 3-bedroom house (Table II-18).

When market rents are compared to the amounts low-income households can afford to pay (Table
II-16), it is clear that very-low- and extremely-low-income households have a difficult time finding
housing without overpaying. Low- and moderate-income households are much more likely to find
affordable rental units, however.
E.       Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to special
circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and income, family
characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some San Gabriel residents may
experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with disabilities, the
elderly, large households, female-headed households with children, homeless people, and farm
workers. This section contains a discussion of the housing needs facing each of these groups.
         1.       Persons with Disabilities
According to the Census Bureau, a “disability” is “… a long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional
condition that can make it difficult for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs,
dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being
able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job or business”. According to recent ACS
estimates, a relatively small proportion of working-age persons in San Gabriel reported a disability.
In the 18-64 age group, less than 2% reported any type of disability (see Table II-19). Of those aged
65 and over, disabilities were much more prevalent. The most common reported disabilities
among seniors included ambulatory difficulties (30%), independent living difficulties (24%) and
self-care difficulties (16%). Housing opportunities for those with disabilities can be maximized
through housing assistance programs and providing universal design features such as widened
doorways, ramps, lowered countertops, single-level units and ground floor units. Programs that will
assist persons with disabilities include the Emergency Shelter and Transitional/Supportive

Developmentally Disabled
As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an
individual that:
    •    Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
         impairments;
    •    Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
    •    Is likely to continue indefinitely;
City of San Gabriel                                          II-17                                 Housing Needs Assessment
Housing Element                                                                                             September 2013

     •    Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of
          major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility;
          e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency; and
     •    Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary,
          or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong
          or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities as a separate category of disability.
According to the U.S. Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the
percentage of the population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many
developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing
environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where
supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally
disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based
services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families
through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two
community-based facilities. The San Gabriel-Pomona Regional Center (SG/PRC) located in
Pomona (http://www.sgprc.org/) provides services for people with developmental disabilities in
San Gabriel. The SG/PRC is a private, non-profit community agency that contracts with local
businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their
families.
There is no charge for diagnosis and assessment for eligibility. Once eligibility is determined, most
services are free regardless of age or income. There is a requirement for parents to share the cost of
24-hour out-of-home placements for children under age 18. This share depends on the parents'
ability to pay. There may also be a co-payment requirement for other selected services.
Regional centers are required by law to provide services in the most cost-effective way possible.
They must use all other resources, including generic resources, before using any regional center
funds. A generic resource is a service provided by an agency that has a legal responsibility to
provide services to the general public and receives public funds for providing those services. Some
generic agencies may include the local school district, county social services department, Medi-Cal,
Social Security Administration, Department of Rehabilitation and others. Other resources may
include natural supports. This is help that disabled persons may get from family, friends or others
at little or no cost.
          2.       Elderly
Recent Census estimates for the age distribution of San Gabriel heads of household are shown in
Table II-20. About one-quarter of homeowners and about 10% of renters were age 65 or older.
Many elderly persons are dependent on fixed incomes or have disabilities. Elderly homeowners

may be physically unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone. The housing needs of
this group can be addressed through smaller units, second units on lots with existing homes,
shared living arrangements, congregate housing and housing assistance programs. Programs that
will assist the elderly include the Senior and Second Units Program, the Section 8 Program, and
the Housing Information and Referral Services Program (see Chapter V – Housing Action Plan).

Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as those with
five or more members. Approximately 38% of owner households and 49% of renter households
have only one or two members. About 9% of renter households had five or more members and
about 20% of owners were large households (Table II-21). This distribution indicates that the need
for large units with four or more bedrooms is expected to be significantly less than for smaller
units. Programs that will assist large households include the Section 8 Program, the Housing
Information and Referral Services Program, and various programs that will facilitate affordable
housing development (see Chapter V – Housing Action Plan).

         4.        Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households often have greater housing challenges than families with two adults.
Approximately 10% of owner households and 18% of renter households in San Gabriel were
headed by a female (Table II-22). The City has no housing programs that are specifically directed to
female-headed households, however the Housing Information and Referral Services Program, the
Section 8 program, and various programs that will facilitate affordable housing development will
also help female-headed households (see Chapter V – Housing Action Plan).

Farm workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary income is from seasonal
agricultural work. In the early 1900s, agriculture became an important part of Los Angeles
County’s economy. Agriculture mainly occurred in the San Fernando Valley, located northwest of
San Gabriel. An ample and reliable water supply coupled with a coastal valley climate made it ideal
for growing crops. However, residential growth and shifts in the local economy to trade, transport,
and utilities and professional and business service sectors have significantly curtailed agricultural
production within the county. Today, the San Gabriel Valley is a mostly developed
urban/suburban region, with a strong local economy which is not tied to an agricultural base.
Because there are no agricultural operations within San Gabriel, there is no apparent need for
permanent on-site farm worker housing. Programs that facilitate the production and rehabilitation
of affordable housing help to address the needs of workers in the agriculture and other low-wage
industries.
The Census Bureau 3 estimated that there are about 20,535 persons employed in agriculture,
forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining occupations in Los Angeles County, with 104 of those
(0.5%) in San Gabriel.

          6.       Homeless Persons
a.        The Nature of Homelessness
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines the term “homeless” as
the state of a person who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate night-time residence, or a person who
has a primary residence that is:
          •        A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary
                   living accommodations;
          •        An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be
                   institutionalized; or
          •        A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
                   accommodation for human beings.
Although there are multiple causes of homelessness, among the most common causes are:
          •        Substance abuse and alcohol
          •        Domestic violence
          •        Mental illness
b.        Estimate of Homeless Needs
Due to the nature of homelessness, it is impossible to enumerate homeless persons and families in
a given jurisdiction. While a portion of homeless persons seek temporary refuge in shelter
facilities, a significant number live “on the streets” or in cars, parks or other areas not intended for
human residency.
The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires that a
systematic count of homeless person within each Continuum of Care (CoC) be conducted every
two years. The January 2011 counts, conducted within the four continuums in Los Angeles
County, are the most recent available data. The Los Angeles Continuum of Care, headed by the
Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA), contains the majority of jurisdictions and
areas within the County of Los Angeles except for the cities of Glendale, Long Beach, and
Pasadena, who administer and operate their own respective continuums. The 2011 Greater Los
Angeles Homeless Count was performed using HUD-recommended protocols for counting
homeless persons and estimating the number of people who are homeless at a particular point in
time and over the course of a year 4. LAHSA divided the county into Service Planning Areas
(SPAs). The San Gabriel Valley is designated SPA 3 (see Figure II-2).
Results from the 2011 counts determined that within Los Angeles County (excluding the cities of
Glendale, Pasadena and Long Beach, which conducted separate counts), there were an estimated
45,422 homeless persons at a given point in time, and within the San Gabriel Valley there were an
estimated 3,918 homeless persons.

Count (http://www.lahsa.org/docs/2011-Homeless-Count/HC11-Detailed-Geography-Report-FINAL.PDF)

LAHSA’s “Opt-In Program” provides local jurisdictions with homeless count numbers specific to
their area or city allowing them to obtain local homeless count information to more effectively
address local homelessness and to report progress to federal, state, and county agencies to meet
funding requirements. The City of San Gabriel participated in the 2011 Greater Los Angeles
Homeless Count, which identified 17 unsheltered adult homeless persons within the city.
In late 2007 the San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments (SGVCOG) initiated a community-
based, “bottom-up” approach to addressing the issue of homelessness in cooperation with the
County of Los Angeles. The purpose of this effort is to develop a regional homeless strategy for

enhancing the homeless service delivery system in the San Gabriel Valley. To achieve this goal, the
study was divided into two phases: I - Diagnostic survey of homeless services and targeted
population; and II - Consensus-building process focused on development of an implementation
plan to address unmet needs with particular emphasis on the participation of community- and
faith-based organizations in the region. The Phase I report was completed in 2008 but Phase II has
not been completed.
c.       Inventory of Shelter Facilities
Facilities that serve homeless persons and families are often characterized as “emergency shelters,”
“transitional housing”, or “supportive housing.” Existing facilities of each type are discussed below.
         i.      Emergency Shelter Programs. Emergency shelters provide temporary shelter for up
                 to 6 months and provide basic on-site case management, meals, and clothing.
                 Within the San Gabriel Valley, there are currently 10 emergency shelter programs
                 providing 108 emergency shelter beds for single clients and 178 emergency shelter
                 beds for family clients. These shelter locations are identified in Figure II-3 below.
                 None of these is located within the City of San Gabriel.

                          Emergency Shelter Locations – San Gabriel Valley
         ii.     Transitional Housing Programs. Transitional housing provides temporary shelter
                 for a time period typically up to 2 years and offers a more structured program with
City of San Gabriel                                 II-23                       Housing Needs Assessment
Housing Element                                                                          September 2013

                 a higher level of on-site services including mental health counseling, substance
                 abuse counseling, and legal services, all of which are designed to help clients gain
                 self-sufficiency. Figure II-4 shows the locations of transitional housing facilities in
                 the area. There are 19 transitional housing programs providing 149 transitional
                 housing beds for singles, and 165 transitional housing beds for families in the San
                 Gabriel Valley. In addition, there are three winter shelter programs operating in the
                 San Gabriel Valley providing temporary shelter during the winter months. Like
                 emergency shelters, these services are focused in the Pasadena and Pomona areas;
                 however, one facility (Homes for Life/Athena Home with 6 beds) is located in San
                 Gabriel (Figure II-5).

         iii.    Permanent Supportive Housing. Permanent supportive housing provides
                 affordable housing with on-site supportive services typically for those who are
                 chronically homeless. The San Gabriel Valley has 217 units of permanent
                 supportive housing. The majority of these units (156) are scattered across the region
                 in privately owned rental housing that is subsidized with Shelter Plus Care rental
                 vouchers (which function similar to the Section 8 voucher program). There are five
                 permanent supportive housing developments with a total of 61 units in the SGV
                 region. Four of these projects, totaling 46 units are located in Pasadena. The other
                 is a 15-unit building in Pomona.

                        Number of Sheltered Individuals – San Gabriel Valley
d.       Strategy for Addressing the Homelessness Problem
A principal thrust of Phase II of the SGVCOG project will be to begin working directly with
municipalities, service providers, and other local leadership in the San Gabriel Valley to:
1) develop consensus on the findings of Phase I; 2) determine housing and service delivery models
consistent with community context and preference; and 3) identify Federal, State, and local
resources available for financing the implementation of these locally determined goals. By
planning and organizing across jurisdictions at the sub-regional level, cities are better able to design
and implement plans that accurately reflect local priorities, share and leverage existing resources,
and achieve economies of scale in strategies adopted.

Note: Prior to completion of the final report, the original six study areas were collapsed into four clusters.
Please see Appendix D for the final study area map as revised.
Senate Bill 2 of 2007
Senate Bill (SB) 2 of 2007 strengthened the planning requirements for local governments in the
area of emergency and transitional/supportive housing. Cities must estimate the number of
persons in need of emergency shelter and determine whether adequate capacity currently exists to
serve the need. If there is insufficient capacity, cities are required either to identify at least one
zoning district where emergency shelters may be established “by right” (i.e., without a conditional
use permit), or enter into a multi-party agreement with up to two other jurisdictions to provide
shelter facilities to jointly serve the participating jurisdictions.
SB 2 also requires that transitional and supportive housing be treated as a residential use that is
subject only to those requirements and procedures that are applicable to other housing of the same
type in the same zone.
The City’s zoning regulations have been revised in compliance with SB 2. The Housing
Information and Referral Services Program also assists homeless persons in finding housing and
supportive services.
F.       Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
This section identifies all residential units in the city that are under an affordability restriction,
along with any units that are at risk of losing their low-income affordability restrictions within the
ten-year period 2013-2023. This information is used in establishing programs and quantified
objectives for units to be conserved during this planning period. The inventory of assisted units
includes all units that have been assisted under any federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), state, local and/or other program.
         1.       Inventory of Assisted Units
Table II-23 lists all units in the city with affordability covenants. One multi-family project, Las
Casas Apartments, was acquired by a non-profit tenant association under the HUD Title VI
program in July 1996 and has a 55-year covenant that extends until 2051. The other project, at
402-404 S. San Gabriel Blvd., is a density bonus project that provided 5 affordable units with
affordability covenants until 2056. None of the units in either of these projects is at risk of
conversion during this planning period.

          2.          Analysis of Units at Risk
State Law requires Housing Elements to include an assessment of low- and moderate-income
housing units that may be lost to the affordable inventory through the expiration of affordability
restrictions during the next ten-year period. For this Housing Element, the at-risk analysis covers
the period from October 15, 2013 through October 15, 2023. As seen in the previous table, there
are no units at-risk of conversion during this period.
G.        Future Growth Needs
          1.          Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to plan for
anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the anticipated need for housing within each
jurisdiction for the period from January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2021. Communities then
determine how they will address this need through the process of updating the Housing Elements
of their General Plans.
The RHNA was adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) in
October 2012. The future need for housing is determined primarily by the forecasted growth in
households in a community. Each new household, created by a child moving out of a parent's
home, by a family moving to a community for employment, and so forth, creates the need for a
housing unit. The housing need for new households is then adjusted to maintain a desirable level
of vacancy to promote housing choice and mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for
units expected to be lost due to demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses.
The sum of these factors – household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need — determines
the construction need for a community. Total housing need is then distributed among four
income categories on the basis of the county’s income distribution, with adjustments to avoid an
over-concentration of lower-income households in any community.

         2.      2014-2021 San Gabriel Growth Needs
The total housing growth need for the City of San Gabriel during the 2014-2021 projection period
is 930 units. This total is distributed by income category as shown in Table II-24. As permitted by
state law, the need for extremely-low-income units has been established as one-half the need in the
very-low category.

III. Resources and Opportunities
This chapter of the Housing Element evaluates the residential development potential that could
occur in San Gabriel over the 2013-2021 planning period, and discusses the financial and
administrative resources available to assist the City in meeting its objectives. Opportunities for
energy conservation in residential development are also examined.
A.       Land Resources
         1.       Inventory of Sites for Housing Development
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an “inventory of
land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for
redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to
these sites.” A detailed analysis of vacant land and potential redevelopment opportunities has been
prepared and is described in Appendix B. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table III-1
below. The table shows that vacant and underutilized sites have adequate capacity to accommodate
development commensurate with the City’s RHNA allocation.

         2.       Availability of Public Facilities and Services
As a mature, urbanized community, San Gabriel has already in place all of the necessary
infrastructure to support future development. All land designated for residential and mixed-use is
served by sewer and water lines, streets, storm drains, telephone, electrical and gas lines. However,
due to the age of these facilities, ongoing maintenance and upgrading is necessary to ensure
adequate service.
Water. San Gabriel is served by five water companies, with the San Gabriel County Water District
as the largest water provider in the City. The other four companies are: San Gabriel Valley Water

Company, California American Water Company, Sunnyslope Water Company, and Golden State
Water Company. None of the five companies has established limits or moratoriums on new water
hook-ups and all have reported that sufficient supply is available to serve anticipated growth
through the planning period.
Wastewater. All properties in the city are served by sanitary sewers. Preparation of a sewer facilities
master plan was initiated in 2008 and was completed in 2010. This plan identified improvements
needed to serve the city. A fair-share development fee program is already in place to offset a
portion of the cost of needed improvements. However, the magnitude of estimated costs is
daunting. The cost to upgrade the sewer system is estimated at about $30 million citywide.
Other Facilities. In addition to water and wastewater, other required public facilities include
streets, storm drainage, lighting, parks and recreation facilities. The costs of needed improvements
are substantial. There is a 15-year backlog of street reconstruction projects, and storm drainage
facilities have not had any substantial upgrades since the 1930s. Based on modern standards, the
city has a severe deficiency in parkland – 26 acres existing compared to the National Recreation
and Parks Association standard of 400 acres and the General Plan standard of 160 acres. Although
financial analysis supports a park fee of up to $17,000 per unit, the City has set the fee at only
$1,925 per unit in order to minimize impact on development.
The current Capital Improvement Program (CIP) estimates the total cost of needed facilities and
improvements to be $95 million, while only $45 million in funding has been identified. It is likely
that the new CIP, currently in preparation, will show even greater needs and costs.
The City continues to take affirmative steps to provide adequate infrastructure and mitigate the
impacts of new development. Development impact fees have been established for roads, fire
protection and police facilities to provide a fair-share funding mechanism for needed
improvements. To ensure the availability and adequacy of public facilities and services for future
development, the City, along with other providers of public services (e.g. water and sewer), will
continue to carry out regular maintenance improvements and upgrading to the extent that funding
allows. At this time there are no known infrastructure issues that would preclude the level of
residential development envisioned in the RHNA, although repair or upgrading of facilities may
be necessary in connection with new development projects. However, it is likely that total
infrastructure needs will continue to exceed the City’s financial capacity in the foreseeable future.
For further discussion of public facilities and infrastructure issues, please refer to Community
Facilities Chapter 5 of the General Plan and the current Capital Improvement Program, which are
available for review at City Hall.

B.       Financial and Administrative Resources
         1.      State and Federal Resources
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) - Federal funding for housing
programs is available through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The
City uses its CDBG funds for the improvement and development of housing, public infrastructure
and facilities, and provision of various services. San Gabriel participates in the Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) program through the County of Los Angeles, which applies to
HUD for funds on behalf of the City and other non-entitlement jurisdictions. The City's CDBG
allocation for the current fiscal year (FY 2012-13) was $318,433.
Section 8 Rental Assistance – The Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles (HACoLA)
administers the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program. The Housing Assistance
Payments Program assists elderly and disabled households by paying the difference between 30%
of an eligible household's income and the actual cost of renting a unit. According to the County
Housing Authority there were 288 families participating in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher
program in San Gabriel as of April 2013 6.
         2.      Local Resources
San Gabriel Redevelopment Agency - On December 29, 2011, the California Supreme Court
ruled in the redevelopment litigation – CRA vs. Matosantos – upholding AB XI 26 which
abolished redevelopment agencies and striking down AB XI 27 that would have allowed agencies
to survive if they contributed money to the State. As a consequence of the ruling, redevelopment
agencies were dissolved on February 1, 2012.
On February 7, 2012, pursuant to Part 1.85 of Division 24 of the Health and Safety Code, the
City Council of the City of San Gabriel adopted Resolution No. 12-03 designating the City of San
Gabriel as the Successor Agency to the San Gabriel Redevelopment Agency. As Successor Agency,
the City is responsible for winding down the Agency’s existing obligations and liquidating the
Agency’s assets. On February 7, 2012, pursuant to Assembly Bill 1X 26, the City Council approved
and adopted a Revised Enforceable Obligation Payment Schedule (“EOPS”) by Resolution No. 12-
05. On February 21, 2012, the City Council elected to transfer assets and functions previously
performed by the San Gabriel Redevelopment Agency to the Los Angeles County Housing
Authority Pursuant to Part 1.85 of Division 24 of the California Health and Safety Code and
adopted Resolution No. 12-04.
Mills Act - Economic incentives can foster the preservation of residential neighborhoods and the
revitalization of downtown commercial districts. The Mills Act is the single most important
economic incentive program in California for the restoration and preservation of qualified historic
buildings by private property owners. Enacted by the state legislature in 1972, the Mills Act grants
participating local governments (cities and counties) the authority to enter into contracts with
owners of qualified historic properties who actively participate in the restoration and maintenance

of their historic properties while receiving property tax relief. San Gabriel administers a Mills Act
program, which furthers housing affordability by reducing property taxes and also by discouraging
“mansionization”, the term used when small older homes are demolished and replaced with much
larger new homes.
C.       Opportunities for Energy Conservation
As residential energy costs rise, increasing utility costs reduce the affordability of housing. The City
has many opportunities to directly affect energy use within its jurisdiction. Title 24 of the
California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards for new development, and
requires adoption of an “energy budget”. The following are among the alternative ways to meet
these energy standards.
         Alternative 1: The passive solar approach which requires proper solar orientation,
         appropriate levels of thermal mass, south facing windows, and moderate insulation levels.
         Alternative 2: Generally requires higher levels of insulation than Alternative 1, but has no
         thermal mass or window orientation requirements.
         Alternative 3: Also is without passive solar design but requires active solar water heating in
         exchange for less stringent insulation and/or glazing requirements.
In turn, the home building industry must comply with these standards while localities are
responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations. Some additional opportunities for
energy conservation include various passive design techniques. Among the range of techniques
that could be used for purposes of reducing energy consumption are the following:
         •       Locating the structure on the northern portion of the sunniest portion of the site;
         •       Designing the structure to admit the maximum amount of sunlight into the
                 building and to reduce exposure to extreme weather conditions;
         •       Locating indoor areas of maximum usage along the south face of the building and
                 placing corridors, closets, laundry rooms, power core, and garages along the north
                 face;
         •       Making the main entrance a small enclosed space that creates an air lock between
                 the building and its exterior; orienting the entrance away from prevailing winds; or
                 using a windbreak to reduce the wind velocity against the entrance.
Utility companies serving San Gabriel offer various programs to promote the efficient use of
energy and assist lower income customers. These programs are discussed below.

Southern California Edison programs
Southern California Edison offers a variety of energy conservation services under the Low Income
Energy Efficiency programs (LIEE), which help qualified homeowners and renters conserve energy
and control their electricity costs. Eligible customers receive services from local community
agencies and licensed contractors working with Edison. Services include weatherization, efficient
lighting and cooling, refrigerator replacement, and energy education. In addition, Edison
participates in the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program which provides a 15-
percent discount on electric bills for low-income customers.
Southern California Gas programs
The Southern California Gas Company offers two direct assistance programs to limited income
customers: (1) a no-cost weatherization (such as attic insulation and water blankets) and (2) a no-
cost furnace repair and replacement service. The Gas Company also participates in the State
CARE program, providing low-income customers with a discount on their gas bills.
City programs
In addition to the public utility energy conservation programs discussed above, the City has taken
additional steps to encourage conservation and reduce greenhouse emissions, including the
following:
         •       Planted over 1,100 street trees since 2003 in residential and commercial
                 neighborhoods and conditioned developments to plant approximately 1,900 trees
                 on private property in the same time period. Trees absorb carbon from the
                 atmosphere, helping to reduce greenhouse gas levels.
         •       The City has celebrated Arbor Day with tree plantings every year since 2006
         •       The Valley Boulevard Neighborhoods Sustainability Specific Plan adopted
                 December 2006 by Council encourages, where possible, passive solar orientation of
                 residential buildings containing five or more units to reduce heat gain and thereby
                 reduce dependence on air-conditioning. The plan also requires such buildings to
                 have solar hot water production, plant trees to maximize shading in the summer
                 and fall, design landscape lighting to minimize energy use, utilize daylighting
                 strategies to maximize natural light, provide enhanced shading on southern and
                 western fenestration, provide operable windows for natural ventilation, utilize high
                 performance wall and roof insulation, select light, reflective wall colors and Energy
                 Star labeled roofs, install dual-pane, high-performance low-emissivity glazing, exceed
                 Title 24 energy conservation standards by at least 10%, and specify and install
                 Energy Star-rated appliances, high efficiency heating and cooling equipment and
                 CFC-free and HCFC-free equipment.
         •       San Gabriel's City Council approved the City's first Energy Action Plan 7 (EAP) at

                     improvements and save money on energy bills.
                 2. Provide a roadmap for reducing the City’s energy bills.
                 3. Reduce the City and community’s impact on the environment.
                 4. Provide the City with critical baseline data that the State requires for cities to
                     address greenhouse gas emissions.
                 5. Enable the City to get additional grants.
                 6. Serve as a foundation for future planning efforts such as general plan updates,
                     climate action plans, Housing Element updates and zoning code updates,
                     among others.

IV. Housing Constraints
The provision of adequate and affordable housing can be constrained by a number of factors. This
chapter assesses the various physical, market, and governmental factors that may serve as potential
constraints to housing development and improvement in San Gabriel.
A.       Physical Constraints
         1.      Traffic Circulation
Another local concern is the impact of higher densities on traffic and parking. San Gabriel's street
system was originally designed for low-density development. However, traffic conflicts in the
Mission District exist where streets are narrow and radiate out from the Mission rather than
following the grid pattern prevalent further north and south of the City. In addition, the railroad
crosses the middle of the City from east to west at grade. These traffic conflicts will likely be
resolved to some extent by the Alameda Corridor-East transportation and infrastructure project.
Upon completion (estimated for 2017) the project will involve grade separations and minor
roadway widening of major thoroughfares designed to alleviate traffic conditions.
With the adoption of San Gabriel’s revised General Plan in 2004, the City established its
commitment to require better quality design, more walkable and attractive streets, and more
pedestrian friendly neighborhoods. Since the General Plan was adopted, the Mission District
Specific Plan and the Valley Vision Neighborhood Sustainability Plan have been created to
implement that vision. Each of the plans require developers to provide certain streetscape
amenities (e.g., landscaping, hardscape, lighting, street furniture, etc.) to create a distinctive sense
of place and a more walkable environment. The adopted standards also ensure that developers can
quickly identify and meet the City’s expectations without exhausting time with submittal of
multiple design proposals. The Valley Boulevard Specific Plan also provides for the incorporation
of traffic calming strategies into the design of pedestrian and streetscape improvements. These
include pocket landscaped medians, enhanced crosswalk paving and pinched curbs
         2.      Noise
The major noise sources in the City are the San Bernardino (I-10) Freeway, the railroad, and the
major arterial streets -- San Gabriel Boulevard, Del Mar Avenue, Las Tunas Drive, and Valley
Boulevard. Commercial and industrial uses line the arterial streets and most of the railroad tracks.
However, some single-family neighborhoods abutting the railroad right-of-way have no sound
attenuation barriers. The Alameda Corridor-East project will likely result in noticeable reduction
in noise levels as the project will involve grade separations, i.e. lowering of the railroad tracks. The
freeway also impacts residential areas immediately adjacent to it, although this impact has been
mitigated to some extent by the sound walls erected by State Department of Transportation
(CalTrans).
City of San Gabriel                                 IV-1                               Housing Constraints
Housing Element                                                                            September 2013

         3.      Historical and Archaeological Resources
San Gabriel is the site of one of the original 21 missions in Father Junipero Serra's chain of
California missions. Before the Spanish settled in the area, it was the site of a Native American
settlement. As a result, excavation in the City may uncover artifacts from these previous
settlements, particularly near the Mission and along the Alhambra Wash. If such a find were to
occur, it would cause significant delays in construction. There are several properties in the City’s
land inventory within the Mission District Specific Plan area that could conceivably have
archaeological resources that would be exposed by development activities.
B.       Market Constraints
         1.      Development Costs
Construction costs vary widely according to the type of development, with multi-family housing
generally less expensive to construct than single-family homes. Furthermore, a wide variation exists
within each construction type depending on the size of unit and the number and quality of
amenities provided, such as fireplaces, swimming pools, and interior fixtures among others.
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development standards and general
market conditions. The City has no influence over materials and labor costs, and the building
codes and development standards in San Gabriel are not substantially different than most other
cities in Los Angeles County. Construction costs for materials and labor have increased at a
slightly higher pace than the general rate of inflation according to the Construction Industry
Research Board.
A reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials (above the minimum acceptable for
health, safety, and adequate performance) could result in lower sales prices. In addition, pre-
fabricated factory built housing may provide for lower priced housing by reducing construction
and labor costs. Another factor related to construction costs is the number of units built at one
time. As the number increases, overall costs generally decrease as builders are able to take
advantage of the economies of scale. This type of cost reduction is of particular benefit when
density bonuses are used for the provision of affordable housing.
The price of raw land and any necessary improvement is a key component of the total cost of
housing. The diminishing supply of land available for residential construction combined with a
fairly steady demand for such development has served to keep the cost of land fairly high,
particularly in desirable areas like San Gabriel. Higher density allows land costs to be spread across
more housing units, thereby reducing per-unit costs. The increase in allowable densities in targeted
areas such as the Mission District and Valley Boulevard Specific Plan has served to mitigate rising
land prices.
         2.      Financing
The recent crisis in the mortgage industry will affect the availability and cost of real estate loans,
although the long-term effects are unpredictable. The problem resulted when “sub-prime” lenders
City of San Gabriel                                 IV-2                             Housing Constraints
Housing Element                                                                         September 2013

made it possible for low-income families or others who could not qualify for standard mortgages to
become home owners even though they might not have had the credit history and income to
support repayment of the loans. These problems typically occurred with adjustable rate mortgages
(ARMs) after the initial fixed interest rate period expired (often two or three years) and the interest
rate converted to market. Because ARMs often offer “teaser” initial interest rates well below
market for the first few years, monthly payments may increase by several hundred dollars when the
loan converts to market rate. When property values were increasing, as was the case from 2000 to
2006, homeowners had the option of refinancing to a new loan when the initial rate expired.
However, when property values declined, homeowners owed more than the resale value of their
home, making refinancing impossible. As a result of these conditions, there was a significant rise
in default rates, and changes in mortgage underwriting standards had greater impacts on low-
income families than households with higher incomes.
HUD’s Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) provided one-time emergency Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) assistance to state and local governments to acquire and
redevelop foreclosed properties that might otherwise become sources of abandonment and blight
within their communities. The NSP provided grants for local communities to purchase foreclosed
or abandoned homes and to rehabilitate, resell, or redevelop these homes in order to stabilize
neighborhoods and stem the decline of house values of neighboring homes. Since San Gabriel was
not identified as one of the hardest-hit communities in the San Gabriel Valley, NSP funds were
not targeted to the City.
C.       Governmental Constraints
Housing affordability is affected by factors in both the private and public sectors. Actions by the
City can have an impact on the price and availability of housing. Land use controls, site
improvement requirements, building codes, fees, and other local programs intended to improve
the overall quality of housing may serve as a constraint to housing development.
         1.      Land Use Controls
General Plan. The Land Use Element of the General Plan sets forth the City's policies for guiding
local development. These policies, together with existing zoning, establish the amount and
distribution of land to be allocated for different uses within the City. The General Plan Land Use
Element provides the following categories of residential use:
         Low Density: Primarily single-family homes on a single parcel, occasionally including two
         homes (attached or detached) on a larger parcel.
         Density range: 0 – 6 units/acre
         Medium Density: Low-scale, multi-family dwellings, predominately on sites less than an
         acre in area.
         Density range: 7 – 11 units/acre
City of San Gabriel                                 IV-3                             Housing Constraints
Housing Element                                                                          September 2013

         High Density: Multiple-family dwellings, preferably on sites one acre or larger in size,
         primarily of two-story construction, and of three-story construction for higher-density
         projects granted a density bonus and/or which maximize ground level outdoor recreational
         space.
         Density range: 12 – 25 units/acre
In addition to these residential designations, housing is permitted in a mixed-use arrangement in
the following areas:
         Village Commercial: Maximum building height of 3 stories and 45 feet, with a maximum
         residential density up to 25 units/acre and a maximum floor area ratio of 1.0 for mixed-use
         projects.
         General Commercial: Maximum building height of 3 stories and 45 feet, with a maximum
         residential density up to 25 units/acre and a maximum floor area ratio of 1.0 for mixed-use
         projects.
         Commercial Specific Plan: This designation applies to two specific plan areas, Mission
         District and Valley Boulevard. Development standards are as follows:
                 Mission District Specific Plan – Height limit of 3 stories with a maximum floor
                 area ratio of 1.0 and densities up to 40 units/acre with lot consolidation incentives.
                 Valley Boulevard Specific Plan – Height limit of 5 stories with a maximum floor
                 area ratio of 3.0 (no maximum density).
Additional discussion regarding recent projects in these commercial districts and specific plans is
provided in Section 3, Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types, on p. IV-7 below.
Zoning Ordinance. Consistent with these General Plan land use designations, the Zoning
Ordinance provide for a range of intensities of residential land use:
         Low Density Residential (R-1) - up to 6 dwelling units per acre
         Medium Density Residential (R-2) - up to 11 dwelling units per acre
         High Density Residential (R-3) - up to 25 dwelling units per acre
         Commercial/Residential Mixed Use (C-1 and C-3) - multi-family densities (up to 25 units
         per acre)
         Mission District Specific Plan – mixed-use with residential densities up to 25 units/acre
         (up to 40 units/acre with lot consolidation incentives)
         Valley Boulevard Specific Plan – mixed-use with residential densities in excess of 40
         units/acre (see discussion of Mixed Use in Section 3 on p. IV-8)
City of San Gabriel                                  IV-4                             Housing Constraints
Housing Element                                                                          September 2013

Housing supply and cost are greatly affected by the amount of land designated for residential use
and the density at which development is permitted. In San Gabriel, 51% of the City's land area is
designated for residential uses. Single-family neighborhoods are by far the most common land use
in the City, constituting nearly 41% of the entire land base. Of the remaining land area, two-family
homes (duplexes) comprise about 3%, multi-family housing comprises roughly 8%, and group
housing nearly 1%. As noted in Section III (Resources and Opportunities), the capacity of vacant
and underutilized sites for residential and mixed-use development exceeds the City’s assigned share
of regional housing needs for the planning period.
          2.         Residential Development Standards
The San Gabriel Zoning Code provides for four residential zones: Single-Family Residence (R-1),
Limited Two-Family Residence (R-1A), Low Density Multiple-Family Residence (R-2), and
Multiple-Family Residence (R-3). Table IV-1 provides a summary of residential development
standards in these zones. The City’s development standards have been established to ensure the
continued quality of development in the community.

The City's residential development standards are not overly or unnecessarily restrictive. The
density, setback, and other standards regulating residential development within the City are similar
to those being used by surrounding communities and do not inhibit the development of housing.
Over the next three years, the City will be reviewing and updating as necessary outdated sections of
the Zoning Code. While this will provide an opportunity to analyze the impact of proposed
changes to development standards on housing affordability, the City recognizes that high land cost
is overwhelmingly the major driver behind high housing costs in San Gabriel.
City of San Gabriel                                                 IV-5                             Housing Constraints
Housing Element                                                                                           September 2013

Parking. The Zoning Code establishes parking requirements by housing type and on a per-
bedroom basis, as illustrated in Table IV-2. Two enclosed garage spaces are required for single-
family homes with one to four bedrooms and three spaces are required for homes with five or six
bedrooms. For multi-family housing developments, two garage spaces are required for each unit.
The parking requirement is reduced for senior citizen housing, with 0.75 covered or uncovered
spaces required for each unit.
The requirement that multi-family developments provide two garage parking spaces per unit does
not appear to have had a constraining impact on the cost and supply of such housing in San
Gabriel. This conclusion is based on the fact that during the period 1998-2008, multi-family
developments in the R-2 zone achieved an average density of 10.1 units/acre (92% of the
maximum allowable density), while in the R-3 zone, larger projects of ½ acre or more had an
average density of 24.4 units/acre, (98% of the maximum allowable density) and projects smaller
than ½ acre averaged 16.3 units/acre (65% of the maximum allowable density). Overall, multi-
family projects in the R-3 zone averaged 17.3 units/acre (69% of the maximum allowable density).
During this same period, two mixed-use projects containing affordable housing units were
approved by the City. In neither case did the developer seek a variance, variation or reduction in
the two garage spaces/unit parking standard. One of the projects did request, and was granted, a
variation to increase the percentage of compact parking stalls from the maximum allowable 35% of
all parking spaces to 40%.
In the Density Bonus Ordinance adopted by the City in 2006, developers of affordable housing
are able to request variations (called “incentives” and “concessions” in the ordinance) to
development standards in order to achieve densities necessary to facilitate the construction of
affordable housing. The ordinance allows an applicant to request the following parking standards,
inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, for the entire housing development:
         One on-site parking space for up to one bedroom;
         Two on-site parking spaces for up to three bedrooms;
         Two and one-half on-site parking spaces for more than three bedrooms.
Parking may be provided by tandem or uncovered spaces, but not by on-street parking. An
applicant may request additional parking incentives or concessions beyond these specified in the
ordinance. The City must grant these variations, unless it can make findings that the variation is
not necessary to provide affordable housing costs for the targeted units, or would have specific
adverse impacts on public health, safety, the physical environment, or a property on the California
Register of Historical Resources that cannot be mitigated without rendering the development
unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households.
Second units are required to provide only one parking space (covered or uncovered) for efficiency
or one-bedroom second units. Two-bedroom second units are required to provide two parking
spaces (covered or uncovered).

The parking requirement for the residential component of a mixed-use project is one parking
space per bedroom which shall be located in a garage or carport. However, units designated for
senior citizens (62 years of age or older) shall be provided at a rate of 0.75 spaces per unit (covered
or uncovered). Guest parking for the multi-family residential uses shall be provided at a rate of one
space for every three units. Tandem parking may be used only for the spaces which are assigned
and designated for a single residential unit.
In the Valley Boulevard Specific Plan area, the residential component of a mixed-use project
requires one space for studio and 1-bedroom units, two spaces for 2-bedroom and larger units, and
one guest space for every five units. Tandem parking is allowed.

The conclusion to be drawn from this experience is that the City’s parking standards have not
proven to be a significant cost burden or constraint to the development of multi-family housing.
With respect to affordability, the areas of the city in which allowable residential densities are
greatest, and therefore most conducive to the development of affordable housing, are the mixed-
use zones within the Valley Blvd. Specific Plan. Parking standards in these areas have already been
relaxed from two spaces to one space for smaller (i.e. more affordable units), providing further
incentive for their production.
Given San Gabriel’s built-out nature, new multi-family housing is characterized by small-lot,
scattered-site infill development. Thanks to development and design standards that require
residents’ cars to be parked in enclosed garages, thus mitigating the visual impact of required
parking areas, acceptance and support of these infill projects by both neighbors and the City’s

Housing Element                                                                                             September 2013

Design Review Commission has been the rule rather than the exception. The City of San Gabriel
strongly believes that these standards have served the community well, preserving important local
aesthetic values while facilitating the recycling of properties in multi-family neighborhoods to
higher densities. The City is fully committed to further encouraging the development of this kind
of attractive and affordable housing within its multi-family zones.
Finally, with the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance in place, developers of affordable housing have
the ability to seek reduced parking requirements as one of the allowable concessions that can be
granted to density bonus projects. Because uncovered parking and tandem parking are among the
concessions that must be allowed under state density bonus law, the City would permit uncovered
and tandem parking in any qualifying affordable housing development.
Density Bonus. In 2006 the City amended the Code in conformance with current state density
bonus law (SB 1818). Two density bonus applications were filed in 2007, both of which were
approved.
           3.        Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available
through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of a variety
of housing types for all income levels, including multi-family rental housing, factory-built housing,
mobile homes, emergency shelters, and transitional housing. Table IV-3 provides a summary of the
housing types permitted by residential zone category.

Multiple-Family and Mixed-Use Development
Multiple-family housing units, including apartment and condominium developments, account for
approximately 37% of the housing stock in San Gabriel. Multiple-family dwellings are permitted
uses in the R-2 and R-3 zones with maximum densities of 11 and 25 units per acre, respectively,
City of San Gabriel                                                      IV-8                      Housing Constraints
Housing Element                                                                                       September 2013

excluding density bonus. In addition, multi-family uses at up to 25 units per acre in a mixed-use
setting are conditionally allowed in the C-1 and C-3 zones and, as of 2004, in the Mission District
as well. R-3 properties and mixed-use developments in the Mission District can achieve densities
up to 40 units per acre through lot-consolidation incentives (see Program 7 in Chapter V). Multi-
family residential uses are permitted on the second and third floors above ground floor
commercial or office uses. On large sites of three acres or more, ground floor multi-family
residential use is also permitted in mixed-use developments subject to a CUP.
The adoption of the Valley Boulevard Specific Plan in 2006 further increased the number of
potential sites for multiple-family housing by changing the zoning on portions of major
commercial corridors such as Del Mar Avenue and San Gabriel Boulevard to allow for multiple-
family residential as well as mixed-use and commercial development. For mixed-use projects,
commercial floor area is capped at a floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.70, with a maximum total
(commercial plus residential) FAR of 3.0, building heights up to five stories (as compared to three
stories under the previous code), and densities in excess of 40 units per acre (as compared to 25
units per acre previously). The areas where mixed use is permitted also allow development of stand-
alone commercial projects at FARs ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, depending on zone and lot size. Since
a higher FAR is allowed with mixed use as compared to exclusively commercial projects, the
regulations create a strong incentive for developers to include residential units in these zones.
Since 2006, several new developments in commercial zones have been mixed-use projects.
Mixed-use projects approved in recent years include
the following:
         •   Wilson Tower, 923 E. Valley Blvd. The
             City’s first mixed-use project, built in
             2003, is a 3-story building features 15
             residential condos over 29,000 sq. ft. of
             office space.
         •   288 Plaza, 288 S. San Gabriel Blvd.
             Completed in 2006, this 3-story
             development consists of 9,300 sq. ft. of
             retail, office and restaurant uses on the
             ground floor, 6,400 sq. ft. of offices on
             the second floor, and 9 residential
             condos on the third floor.
         •   Mission Villa, 130 S. Mission Drive.
             The project consists of 11 residential
             condos and 5,200 sq. ft. of retail space.
             The Planning Commission approved
             the project in late 2008 and plans were
             approved by the Design Review

             Commission in late 2009.
         •   San Gabriel Sky Court, 402-404 S. San Gabriel Blvd. This density bonus project
             consists of 31 residential condominiums and 9,000 sq. ft. of ground floor commercial
             space. Five of the units are affordable, with two reserved for moderate-income
             households and two for very-low-income households. This project was approved in
             2010.
         •   400 W. Valley proposes 29 condo units and 17,000 sq. ft. of commercial space. This
             project is in the pre-application stage.
         •   416 E. Las Tunas proposes 15 condo units, 18 live/work units and 9,300 sq. ft. of
             commercial space. This project was approved by the City Council in June 2013.
This successful track record demonstrates that the City’s mixed-use regulations encourage this type
of development.
Adaptive Reuse
Adaptive reuse refers to the conversion of an existing building, generally commercial, industrial or
institutional, into a different use, often residential or mixed-use. In mature cities like San Gabriel
that are fully developed, some older structures that have become functionally obsolete can be
restored and converted to new uses that are more suited to current market conditions.
Senior Housing Units and Second Units
A senior housing unit is an accessory dwelling unit not exceeding 640 square feet that is attached
or detached from the primary residence. The unit may contain kitchen facilities and is intended
for the sole occupancy of one or two adults, with the primary occupant required to be 62 years of
age or older. All residentially-zoned properties are eligible for senior housing units with approval of
a CUP.
The review and approval process for senior housing units through a CUP closely parallels that for
other types of conditionally permitted housing, such as mixed-use developments. Normal
processing time from submission of a complete application to hearing before the Planning
Commission is 90 days. Unlike non-age-restricted second units, which are permitted by-right on
residentially-zoned properties meeting minimum size requirements, the City has chosen to retain
the CUP process for the review and approval of senior housing units. This is due to the fact that,
unlike second units, senior units are possible on any residentially-zoned lot in the city, are not
required to provide any additional parking, do not have defined design standards, and are often
somewhat larger than the typical second unit. Taken together, these factors result in a greater
potential impact on the surrounding neighborhood, and thus the desire of the City to maintain a
discretionary review process for these units.
City of San Gabriel                                   IV-10                           Housing Constraints
Housing Element                                                                           September 2013

Second units are defined as detached or attached dwelling units which provide complete
independent living facilities for one or more persons. The City revised its Zoning Ordinance in
2003 to eliminate the requirement of a CUP for second units. Also such units were previously
possible only on R-1 lots that abutted a higher residential density zone, and then only if the R-1 lot
was at least 15,000 square feet in size. Since the code revision, second units are now permitted on
any residential property that has a minimum lot size of 7,260 square feet. Approximately 32
second units have been approved since these Code revisions were adopted, an average of
approximately 3 per year.
Manufactured Housing
Pursuant to State law, the City permits manufactured housing, including factory-built housing, in
all residential zones. There are no mobile home parks in the city, and it is considered unlikely that
any will be developed in the foreseeable future due to high land cost.
Housing for Lower-Income Persons and Families
In areas with high land cost such as the Los Angeles basin, higher densities can reduce the per-unit
cost and increase housing affordability. Assembly Bill 2348 of 2004 established a “default density”
of 30 units/acre for most metropolitan jurisdictions, which is the density that is presumed to be
adequate to facilitate the production of lower-income housing. The San Gabriel Zoning Code
allows a density of 25 units/acre (excluding density bonus) in the R-3 district and in mixed-use
projects in the C-1 and C-3 districts, and in the Mission District Specific Plan. Two mixed-use
density bonus projects containing very-low- and low-income deed-restricted units were approved in
the C-1 and C-3 zones during the previous planning period. In addition, the Valley Boulevard
Specific Plan allows mixed-use development up to 5 stories with unlimited density. Additional
discussion regarding the affordability assumptions for future development is provided in Appendix
B.
         4.      Special Needs Housing
The following section discusses how the Zoning Code encourages and facilitates housing for
persons with special needs.
Residential Care Facilities and Housing for Persons with Disabilities
State-licensed care homes include family care homes, foster homes, and group homes serving
mentally disordered, handicapped persons, or dependent or neglected children. Care homes
serving 6 or fewer persons are permitted by-right in all four residential zones. Care homes serving 7
or more persons are also permitted in all residential zones, subject to a CUP.
Definition of “Family” – The Municipal Code defines “Family” as “A single residential unit or a person
or group of persons living together as a domestic unit in a single residential unit.” This definition is

Housing Element                                                                           September 2013

Concentration requirements – There are no separation or maximum concentration limits in the
Code for residential care facilities.
Processing procedures – Residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons are treated the same
as a single-family residence and there are no processing procedures for establishing one in an
existing residence, other than building, electrical, plumbing or mechanical permits related to any
proposed remodeling. If such a facility were proposed for construction on a vacant site, in addition
to the aforementioned permits, it would also go through a Large Site Plan Review. This is a non-
discretionary review to confirm that the project complies with applicable Code requirements and is
identical to the process for any single-family home. The process involves submitting plans for
review by Planning, Building, Engineering, Police and Fire. After the Large Site Plan Review is
complete, typically in about 30 days (longer if significant corrections/redesigns required),
construction drawings may be submitted to Building for plan check.
For residential care facilities serving seven or more persons a conditional use permit is required,
which is permissible under state law. The CUP process involves review of plans by all City
departments and a public hearing before the Planning Commission. The entire process, from
initial submittal to public hearing, generally takes approximately 90 days. If the facility involved
new construction on a vacant lot, it would also require a Precise Plan of Design (PPD). Depending
on the size of the building, the PPD would be reviewed by staff (under 3,000 sq. ft.) or by the
Design Review Commission (3,000 sq. ft. or more). This review takes place after CUP approval
and usually takes 30-45 days.
Site planning requirements – There are no standards or conditions applied to residential care
facilities serving six or fewer persons that are not required of conventional housing.
Licensed family care homes, foster homes, or group homes serving seven or more mentally
disordered or otherwise handicapped persons or dependent and neglected children where
authorized pursuant to Cal. Welfare & Institutions Code §5116 require a CUP and must comply
with the following standards:
       (A)    All such uses shall have and maintain a minimum net lot area of not less than 21,780
              square feet; and
       (B) All such uses shall have and maintain a minimum width, depth and street frontage of
              70 feet; and
       (C) In all such uses the side yard area shall be a minimum width of ten feet, and the rear
              yard area shall be a minimum depth of ten feet; and
       (D) All buildings, structures, and landscaping will be developed in a manner harmonious
              and compatible with development on surrounding properties; and
       (E) All exterior parking areas will be screened with landscaping in a manner that ensures
              compatibility with and an enhancement to surrounding properties; and
       (F) All exterior lighting will be designed, oriented, and constructed to shield adjacent
              properties from adverse glare effects.

Housing Element                                                                         September 2013

Reasonable accommodation – The City adopted reasonable accommodation procedures in 2011
(Municipal Code Sec. 153.484 et seq.) in compliance with state and federal fair housing law.
Emergency Shelters
An emergency shelter is a facility that provides shelter to homeless families and/or individuals on a
limited short-term basis, typically six months or less. Senate Bill (SB) 2 of 2007 strengthened the
planning requirements for emergency shelters. Unless adequate capacity is available to serve a
jurisdiction’s existing emergency shelter need, SB 2 requires that shelters be allowed “by-right” (i.e.,
without a conditional use permit or other discretionary approval) in at least one zoning district. As
an alternative, the requirements may be satisfied through a multi-jurisdictional agreement. In
accordance with SB 2, the Municipal Code was amended in the previous planning period to allow
emergency shelters “by-right” within the defined emergency shelter overlay area of the C-3 district
subject to objective development standards without a conditional use permit or other discretionary
approval. The C-3 district encompasses approximately 66acres, 82% (54 acres) of which meets the
overlay criteria for emergency shelter sites (see Figure IV-1). The C-3 district is well-served by
transit, public facilities and commercial services. Municipal Code Sec. 153.162(O) establishes the
following standards for emergency shelters:
         (1) The shelter shall be located adjacent to any zone except R-1;
         (2) The shelter shall be located within one-quarter mile of a bus stop;
         (3) The shelter shall be located within a two-mile radius of a hospital;
         (4) The number of beds shall not exceed one per 130 square feet of gross floor area;
         (5) Off-street parking shall be based on demonstrated need, but shall not be required to
         provide more than one parking space per 200 square feet of gross floor area;
         (6) The size and location of exterior and interior on-site waiting and client intake areas
         shall be subject to the review and approval of the Community Development Department;
         (7) The shelter shall have full-time on-site management;
         (8) The shelter shall be located no closer than 300 feet to another emergency shelter;
         (9) The maximum length of stay of any person shall be six months;
         (10) An exterior lighting plan shall be submitted for the review and approval of the Police
         Department; and
         (11) Security guards, as recommended by the Police Department, shall be provided during
         the hours that the emergency shelter is open.
Factors 1 through-3 define the overlay area, and parcels meeting these criteria are shown in Figure
IV-1. These standards do not significantly constrain the location of emergency shelters within the
C-3 district because 1) the majority of parcels in this zone are not adjacent to the R-1 zone; 2) most
C-3 parcels are located along transit routes within one-quarter mile of a bus stop; 3) and most
parcels within the C-3 zone are within a two-mile radius of a hospital.

Transitional and Supportive Housing
Transitional and supportive housing is temporary (often six months to two years) housing for a
homeless individual or family who is transitioning to permanent housing. Transitional housing
often includes a supportive services component (e.g. job skills training, rehabilitation counseling,
etc.) to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of independent living.
SB 2 requires that transitional and supportive housing be treated as a residential use subject to
only those requirements that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. In
2011 the Zoning Code was amended consistent with state law.
Single Room Occupancy (SROs)
Single room occupancy (SRO) facilities are small studio-type units that help to address the needs of
extremely-low-income individuals. The Municipal Code defines SRO as “A structure with six or
more guest rooms in which 30% or more of the units do not have a private bath and toilet within
the unit.” SROs are conditionally permitted in the M-1 (Light Manufacturing) zone.
         5.      Fees and Improvement Requirements
Various fees and assessments are charged by the City to cover the costs of processing permits and
providing necessary services and infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a pro
rata share system based on the magnitude of the project's impact or the extent of the benefit which
will be derived.
Permit Processing Fees
Table IV-4 provides a listing of fees the City charges for residential development permit processing.
In addition, other fees may be assessed depending upon the circumstances of the development.
For example, the builder may need to pay an inspection fee for sidewalks, curbs, and gutters if
their installation is needed, or the builder may need a Variance, CUP, or Site Plan Review.

Development Impact Fees
After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governments’ property tax revenues,
cities and counties have faced increasing difficulty in providing public services and facilities to
serve their residents. One of the main consequences of Proposition 13 has been the shift in
funding of new infrastructure from general tax revenues to development impact fees and
improvement requirements on land developers. The City requires developers to provide on-site
and off-site improvements necessary to serve their projects. Such improvements may include water,
sewer and other utility extensions, street construction and traffic control device installation that
are reasonably related to the project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a
project for rights-of-way, transit facilities, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent with the
Subdivision Map Act.
Table IV-5 shows the City’s development impact fees related to infrastructure and public facilities.
Assessments on infrastructure or services are waived for property owners who receive public
assistance (including General Assistance and Food Stamps) and those with gross household
incomes not exceeding 50% of the County median income.

The total cumulative processing and development impact fees for typical single-family and multi-
family residential units are approximately $9,500 and $6,000, respectively. These fees do not
exceed the actual cost of processing applications and providing needed services and facilities, and
therefore do not pose an unreasonable constraint to housing development.

Housing Element                                                                                             September 2013

A local residential street requires a 60-foot right-of-way, with two 12-foot travel lanes. The City’s
road standards are typical for cities in Southern California and do not act as a constraint to
housing development.
         6.      Building Codes and Enforcement
In addition to land use controls, local building codes also affect the cost of housing. The City has
adopted the California Building Code (CBC) which establishes minimum construction standards.
These minimum standards cannot be revised to be less stringent without sacrificing basic safety
considerations and amenities. No major reductions in construction costs are anticipated through
revisions to local building codes. Working within the framework of the existing codes, however,
the City will continue to implement planning and development techniques that lower costs and
facilitate new construction where possible.
Code enforcement efforts in San Gabriel focus on bringing substandard housing units into
compliance with City building and property maintenance codes and are implemented by the
Neighborhood Improvement Services Division, consisting of a manager, one full-time and one
part-time Code Enforcement Officer.
The City enforces several regulations that serve to enhance the accessibility to disabled residents.
For example, new apartment developments are subject to requirements under the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) for unit “adaptability” on ground floor units. Adaptable units are built for
easy conversion to disabled access, such as doorway and hallway widths, and added structural
support in the bathroom to allow the addition of handrails. For apartment complexes receiving
federal subsidy, ground floor units (as well as upper floors if an elevator is present) are required to
be fully accessible, and are subject to the federal Architectural Barriers Act.
To comply with new state accessibility requirements in 2005, the City now requires that residential
condominium projects with three or more dwelling units in a single building and apartment
projects with four or more dwelling units in a single building have 10% of the units designed to be
accessible to the disabled. These projects are also required to provide disabled-accessible parking
spaces on site.
Based on this review of zoning and building code requirements, no unreasonable constraints to
the provision of accessible housing have been identified.
         7.      Local Processing and Permit Procedures
The processing time needed to obtain development permits and required approvals is often cited
as a prime contributor to the high cost of housing. Additional time may be necessary for
environmental review, depending on the location and nature of a project. In response to State law,
California cities have been working to improve the efficiency of permit and review processes by
providing “one-stop processing,” thereby eliminating duplication of effort. The City has fully
implemented the provisions of AB 884, as well as more recent legislation requiring the
establishment of one-stop permit coordination.
City of San Gabriel                                  IV-18                           Housing Constraints
Housing Element                                                                          September 2013

Based on periodic surveys conducted by the City, local processing times are comparable to those
experienced in neighboring communities. Single-family homes and multi-family housing
developments of less than five units undergo an administrative (staff) review process which
typically takes three to four weeks. Housing developments with more than four units are required
to be reviewed by the Design Review Commission. The approximate time required to obtain a
CUP, variance, or other entitlements is three months.
The Design Review Commission has not denied a residential project in recent years and the design
review process has not served as a constraint to development. Design review can occur
concurrently with other review processes. On average, the time frame for design review is 90 days
from submittal of a complete application to a decision by the Commission. The City Council has
reduced the size of the Design Review Commission from five to three members, which reduces the
time required for review and deliberation. Plan checking for construction plans of new residential
development by the Building Division averages 4.7 business days for the first submittal.
The majority of projects that go before the Design Review Commission are approved in a single
meeting. In performing their duties, the Commissioners and City Architect are cost conscious and
sensitive to the needs of the applicant. The Commission typically requires only cosmetic changes
that do not significantly add to the cost of development (in terms of both time and money). The
Planning and Design Review Commissions have seldom required a project to reduce the number
of units proposed.
Additionally, the City continues to strive to streamline processing for residential projects. In 2003,
second units on R-1 lots meeting a minimum size requirement became permitted by right and no
longer required a CUP. In the Valley Boulevard Specific Plan, completed in 2006, mixed-use
developments which conform to the standards of the plan are permitted by right, whereas prior
code regulations required approval of a CUP. Also in 2006, the City eliminated the pre-
application review process for multi-family housing projects, which has resulted in a typical
processing time reduction of 30 days.
Applications submitted for CUPs to permit mixed-use developments in the C1 and C3 zones, as
well as within the Mission District Specific Plan area, are first reviewed by the Community
Development, Police and Fire Departments for completeness, code compliance, architectural
design, signage and landscaping. Once this initial review is finished, the Planning Division notifies
the applicant within 30 days of submittal that the application is deemed complete, or if not, what
additional information/materials are needed. Required revisions to the plans and preliminary
conditions of approval are also provided as part of this initial review. Once an application has been
deemed complete, the Planning Division conducts an environmental review and prepares and
posts the appropriate environmental documents as required by CEQA. Since CUP requests are
heard by the Planning Commission, the Planning Division prepares and distributes notices of the
public hearing as well as a staff report with recommendations to the Planning Commission. At the
appointed time, the public hearing is held and the Planning Commission renders its decision. The

timeframe from submittal of a complete CUP application to the Planning Commission hearing is
typically 90 days.
         8.      Service and Facility Infrastructure
Before a development permit is granted, it must be determined that public service and facility
systems are adequate to accommodate any increased demand created by the proposed project.
Because San Gabriel has been almost fully built-out for over two decades, relatively few such
constraints exist, except in certain areas where the infrastructure systems have neared their carrying
capacity. To address these infrastructure constraints, the City began assessing development impact
fees in 2005. The proceeds from these fees are used to upgrade City infrastructure to
accommodate the increased demand on selected public service and facility systems created by new
developments. As a result, the likelihood of a residential development being delayed due to
inadequate infrastructure is very small.

V.       Housing Action Plan
Chapters II through IV of the Housing Element establish the housing needs, as well as the
constraints to and opportunities for housing development in San Gabriel. The Housing Plan
presented in this chapter sets forth the City's goals, policies, and programs to address the identified
housing needs.
A.       Goals and Policies
This section of the Housing Element contains the goals and policies the City intends to implement
to address its identified housing needs. The following four major issue areas are addressed by the
goals and policies of this Element:
         •        ensure that a broad range of housing types are provided to meet the needs of the
                  existing and future residents;
         •        promote affordable housing;
         •        conserve the existing affordable housing stock; and
         •        promote equal housing opportunity.
Each issue area and the supporting goals and policies are identified and discussed in the following
section.
Provide for a Range of Housing Types
Different household types in San Gabriel require housing to fit their particular needs and
circumstances. For example, approximately 15% of the City's renter households are living in
overcrowded conditions, which may indicate an unmet need for affordable units that have three or
more bedrooms, and/or an unmet need for affordable homeownership opportunities. Other
households, such as those consisting of an elderly person living alone, may need smaller, studio
units in a complex that provides supportive services, such as some meals, and transportation.
GOAL 1: Expand the supply of housing in accordance with the land use designations and
policies in the Land Use Element.
Objective 1.1: Provide for the construction of 930new housing units during the 2014-2021 projection period
in order to meet the goals of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA).
         Policy 1.1.1: Promote and encourage the development of housing of various types, designs,
         forms of ownership, and sizes.
City of San Gabriel                                   V-1                             Housing Action Plan
Housing Element                                                                           September 2013

         Policy 1.1.2: Encourage the use of innovative land use techniques and construction
         methods to minimize housing costs without compromising basic health, safety and
         aesthetic considerations.
         Policy 1.1.3: Facilitate the construction of housing for lower- and moderate-income
         households.
         Policy 1.1.4: Periodically re-examine local building and zoning codes for possible
         amendments to reduce construction costs without sacrificing basic health and safety
         considerations.
         Policy 1.1.5: Through subdivision and zoning ordinances, and through the permit process,
         encourage use of innovative construction techniques, design standards, and energy
         conservation methods in new housing development.
         Policy 1.1.6: Encourage development of second units at appropriate locations by
         publicizing the City’s second unit program, and by providing incentives for development of
         such units.
Housing Affordability
According to recent Census Bureau estimates, 60% of lower-income owner households and 84%
of lower-income renter households in San Gabriel were overpaying, or spending more than 30% of
their income on housing.
GOAL 2: Promote and encourage the provision of adequate housing to meet the needs of the
community.
Objective 2.1: Facilitate the construction of 930 new housing units, including housing affordable to
extremely-low-, very-low, low-, and moderate-income households, in accordance with the RHNA and consistent
with the Land Use Element.
         Policy 2.1.1: Encourage a wide range of housing types, prices and ownership forms in new
         construction.
         Policy 2.1.2: Facilitate the development of housing for lower- and moderate-income
         households by private developers.
         Policy 2.1.3: Support the development of cost saving and energy-conserving construction
         techniques.
         Policy 2.1.4: Assist private developers in identifying land suitable for the development of
         housing for lower- and moderate-income households.
City of San Gabriel                                    V-2                               Housing Action Plan
Housing Element                                                                             September 2013

         Policy 2.1.5: Encourage the inclusion of units for extremely-low, very low-, low-, and
         moderate-income families as part of private sponsored housing developments.
         Policy 2.1.6: Support efforts of private lenders to provide responsible alternative financing
         methods to make home ownership available to a greater number of households.
         Policy 2.1.7: Continue to encourage and facilitate density bonuses and other incentives for
         housing development incorporating units for low- and moderate-income households.
         Policy 2.1.8: Discourage the conversion of existing apartment units to condominiums
         where such conversion will diminish the supply of low- and moderate-income housing.
         Policy 2.1.9: Support the Los Angeles County Home Ownership Program (HOP), which
         encourages affordable homeownership opportunities through a first-time homebuyer
         program targeted to low- and moderate-income households.
Objective 2.2: Promote the affordability of existing housing units for low- and moderate-income households by
capturing Federal housing assistance subsidies for the benefit of eligible City residents.
         Policy 2.2.1: Support and pursue programs and funding sources designed to maintain
         and/or improve the affordability of existing housing units to low- and moderate-income
         households.
Conserving the Existing Affordable Housing Stock
Approximately 80% of housing units in San Gabriel are more than 40 years old, and may require
major repairs. This figure indicates that programs to assist lower-income households with home
maintenance/improvement are critical to preventing widespread housing deterioration. The need
for such programs is underscored by problems of overpayment and overcrowding, and the large
proportion of senior citizens on fixed incomes. The highest concentration of substandard units is
located south of Valley Boulevard.
GOAL 3: Promote and encourage the rehabilitation of deteriorated dwelling units and the
conservation of the currently sound housing stock.
Objective 3.1: Conserve the existing housing stock in San Gabriel.
         Policy 3.1.1: Continue to investigate and pursue housing rehabilitation programs and
         funding sources offered by the State and Federal governments.
         Policy 3.1.2: Promote the use of rehabilitation assistance programs to alleviate deteriorated
         or deteriorating housing conditions.

         Policy 3.1.3: Encourage investment of public and private resources to alleviate
         neighborhood deterioration trends.
         Policy 3.1.4: Continue to encourage property owners to improve or rehabilitate owner-
         occupied and rental housing where feasible.
         Policy 3.1.5: Promote the removal and replacement of those substandard units that cannot
         be rehabilitated.
Objective 3.2: Promote the maintenance of currently sound housing.
         Policy 3.2.1: Use public information and assistance programs to encourage repair before
         major damage occurs.
         Policy 3.2.2: Promote representative citizen            participation on   the   formation,
         implementation and review of housing programs.
         Policy 3.2.3: Continue to encourage the maintenance of sound owner-occupied and
         renter-occupied housing.
Fair Housing/Housing Opportunities
In order to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all segments of the community, the
City must ensure equal and fair housing opportunities are available to all residents.
The Housing Element seeks to expand the range of housing opportunities provided in San
Gabriel, including the housing for those with "special needs", including senior citizens on fixed
incomes, very low-, low-, and moderate-income residents, persons with disabilities, large families,
female-headed households with children, and the homeless.
GOAL 4: Promote and encourage housing opportunities accessible to employment centers,
quality community centers, and quality community services for all economic segments of the
community, regardless of race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, disability, sex, familial
status, or marital status.
Objective 4.1: Promote housing opportunities for all.
         Policy 4.1.1: Promote governmental efforts to provide equal opportunity housing for
         existing and projected demands in San Gabriel.
         Policy 4.1.2: Accommodate the City's fair share of the regional housing needs.
City of San Gabriel                                   V-4                          Housing Action Plan
Housing Element                                                                        September 2013
         Policy 4.1.3: Identify segments of the population that have special housing needs and
         develop programs to serve those needs (i.e., single parents, elderly, disabled, large family,
         minority and homeless populations).
B.       Housing Programs
The goals and policies contained in the Housing Element address San Gabriel's identified housing
needs and are implemented through a series of housing programs. Housing programs define the
specific actions the City will take to achieve specific goals and policies.
The City's overall housing program strategy for addressing its housing needs has been defined
according to the following general goals:
         •       Ensure that a broad range of housing types are provided to meet the needs of the
                 existing and future residents;
         •       Promote affordable housing;
         •       Conserve the existing affordable housing stock; and
         •       Promote equal housing opportunity.
Housing programs include both programs currently in operation and new programs that have been
added to address the City's unmet housing needs. This section provides a description of each
housing program, and program objectives for the 2013-2021 planning period. Programs are
grouped by the same four housing issue areas as the goals, objectives and policies listed above:
provision of a range of housing types; housing affordability; conservation of the existing housing
stock; and fair housing/ housing opportunities.
The Housing Programs Summary (Table VI-2), located at the end of this section, summarizes the
goals and objectives of each housing program through 2021 along with identifying the program
funding source, responsible agency, and time frame for implementation.
Provision of a Broad Range of Housing Types
         1.      Senior Housing Units and Second Units
Agency Responsible for Implementation: San Gabriel Community Development Department
Program Description: A senior housing unit is an accessory dwelling unit not exceeding 640
square feet that is attached or detached from the primary residence on a parcel zoned for
residential use. The unit may contain a kitchen or kitchen facilities and is intended for the sole
occupancy of one or two adults. The primary occupant must be 62 years of age or older. Senior
housing units are permitted on all residentially zoned properties, subject to the approval of a CUP.
Nine senior housing units have been approved since 1996.
City of San Gabriel                                  V-5                            Housing Action Plan
Housing Element                                                                        September 2013

Second units are defined as detached or attached dwelling units which provide complete
independent living facilities for one or more persons. Second units are permitted on any
residentially zoned property that has a minimum lot size of 7,260 square feet. Approximately 32
second units have been approved since these code revisions were adopted, or approximately three
per year.
Given the scarcity of developable land remaining in San Gabriel, integrating senior housing units
and second units in existing residential neighborhoods is a means for the City to accommodate
additional affordable rental housing. The development of senior and second units is effective in
dispersing affordable housing throughout the City. Senior housing and second units are
particularly effective in addressing the needs of extremely-low-income households since these units
may be occupied by extended family members with no rent charged, or may be rented at a rate
affordable to extremely-low-income households due to their small size. In order to encourage and
facilitate the provision of additional second units and senior units the City will publicize and
promote this program via the City’s website, newsletter, and cable television channel.
Source of Funding: Department Budget
Program Objective: The City will continue to implement the program. To publicize and promote
the program, the City will inform residents via the City’s website, newsletter, and cable television
channel. Based on past trends and expanded promotion efforts, the City anticipates developing
about 24 senior or second units over the eight-year planning period.
         2.      Zoning for Emergency Shelters/Transitional and Supportive Housing
Agency Responsible for Implementation: San Gabriel Community Development Department
Program Description: An emergency shelter is a facility that provides shelter to homeless families
and/or individuals on a limited, short-term basis, typically six months or less.
Transitional housing is temporary (typically six months to two years) housing for a homeless
individual or family who is transitioning to permanent housing. Transitional housing often
includes a supportive services component, such as job skills training, or rehabilitation counseling,
to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of independent living. Supportive
housing may be permanent and includes services to assist residents with their daily necessities. The
City will continue to facilitate the establishment of these uses, which are permitted by-right in the
R-3 zone subject to the same development standards as for other residential uses of the same type
in the R-3 zone.
Source of Funding: Department Budget
Program Objective: Continue to facilitate establishment of emergency shelters and transitional
and supportive housing throughout the planning period.

Housing Element                                                                        September 2013

         3.      Density Bonus Ordinance
Agency Responsible for Implementation: San Gabriel Community Development Department
Program Description: The price of raw land and any necessary improvement is a key component
of the total cost of housing. The diminishing supply of land available for residential construction
combined with a fairly steady demand for such development has served to keep the cost of land
fairly high, particularly in desirable areas like San Gabriel. Another factor related to construction
costs is the number of units built at one time. As the number increases, overall cost per unit
generally decreases as builders are able to take advantage of the economies of scale. Higher density
allows land costs to be spread across more housing units, thereby reducing per-unit costs. This type
of cost reduction is of particular benefit when density bonuses are used for the provision of
affordable housing. In 2006 the City amended the Code in conformance with current state density
bonus law (SB 1818), and two density bonus projects were approved in the previous planning
period. In addition to the higher densities this ordinance allows, incentives such as reduced
parking or other modifications to development standards help to facilitate the production of
affordable housing.
Source of Funding: Department Budget
Program Objective: The City will continue to offer density bonuses to affordable housing projects
pursuant to the Density Bonus Ordinance. The City will further promote the program via the
City’s website, newsletter, and cable television channel.
         4.      Review and Modification of Development Standards
Agency Responsible for Implementation: San Gabriel Community Development Department
Program Description: The City adopted a number of code revisions in 2006 to streamline the
development review process for housing projects in the City which have continued to promote
housing. These include allowing second unit housing by right without discretionary approvals
given minimum development standards in single-family residential neighborhoods; elimination of
the pre-application review process for multi-family housing projects which has reduced processing
time for applicants by an average of 30 days; adoption of the Mission District Specific Plan that
allows for more varied uses, including residential uses, which were previously not permitted;
adoption of an ordinance to grant density bonuses for affordable housing units and/or senior
housing; and adoption of the Valley Boulevard Specific Plan that includes increased residential
densities and revised code language that provide incentives for mixed-use development.
In 2009, the City adopted a series of additional amendments to the San Gabriel Municipal Code
(SGMC) called "Quick Wins" which focused on simplifying several development standards and
making it easier to do residential construction. Additional amendments are in process ("Greening
the Code") which will include changes to development standards for multi-family and mixed-use
developments. The City will continue to review Code requirements and seek to identify
opportunities to streamline the development process throughout the planning period.

Source of Funding: Department Budget
Program Objective: Review and update outdated sections of the Zoning Code on an annual basis.
This will provide an opportunity to analyze the impact of proposed changes to development
standards on housing affordability and production.
         5.      Housing Summit
Agency Responsible for Implementation: San Gabriel Community Development Department
Program Description: In 2004 and 2005, the City held a series of meetings in which local
architects and developers were invited to presentations on topics such as the Mission District and
Valley Blvd. Specific Plans and the City’s residential design guidelines. These meetings helped to
introduce these local professionals to the City’s housing goals and objectives in these areas.
Source of Funding: Department Budget
Program Objective: Over the course of the planning period, the City will hold at least two
Housing Summits and invite the participation of at least five residential developers with
development experience in the San Gabriel Valley. Through these dialogs, City staff will explain
the development process in San Gabriel and provide information on the City’s housing programs,
including the density bonus program, and affordable housing goals. Staff will also review the City’s
past efforts to streamline the development process and discuss changes that are being considered
to further facilitate development. The Housing Summits will also serve as an opportunity for
developers to provide input on the development process and the challenges they face in developing
housing in the San Gabriel Valley.
         6.      Incentives for Lot Consolidation
Agency Responsible for Implementation: San Gabriel Community Development Department
Program Description: In 2004, the City adopted the Mission District Specific Plan, which
includes incentives for the consolidation of lots zoned for multi-family residential use. Within the
boundaries of the specific plan, allowable density is increased by 67% for properties in the R-2 and
R-3 zones that are at least 32,670 square feet (0.75 acre) in size. Additionally, the Valley Blvd.
Specific Plan, adopted in 2006, has a minimum lot size requirement of 22,000 square feet for
mixed use projects, thus encouraging the consolidation of smaller parcels to achieve this standard.
Source of Funding: Department Budget
Program Objective: The City will continue to encourage the consolidation of lots in order to
achieve higher residential densities. The City will utilize the updated vacant and underused site
inventory to identify areas where lot consolidation is possible and communicate this information
to interested developers.

Housing Affordability
         7.      Section 8 Housing Assistance Program
Agency Responsible for Implementation: County of Los Angeles Housing Authority; San Gabriel
Community Development Department
Program Description: The Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program is administered by
the County of Los Angeles Housing Authority. The Housing Assistance Payments Program assists
very low-income, elderly and disabled households by paying the difference between 30% of an
eligible household's income and the actual cost of renting a unit. Rental assistance not only
addresses housing affordability, but also overcrowding by allowing families that may be “doubling
up” to afford their own housing. The City will continue to promote participation of eligible San
Gabriel residents in the County-administered Section 8 Rental Assistance Program.
Source of Funding: HUD Section 8
Program Objective: The City will advertise availability of the Section 8 Rental Assistance Program
on its website, newsletter and cable television channel to promote participation of eligible San
Gabriel residents in the County-administered Program. Since Section 8 vouchers are portable, the
number of vouchers used in the city will vary over time.
         8.      Los Angeles County Housing Innovation Fund
Agency Responsible for Implementation: Low Income Investment Fund, Century Housing
Corporation, and the Corporation for Supportive Housing
Program Description: In 2006, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the
Homeless Prevention Initiative which allocated $20 million for the creation of an affordable
housing revolving loan fund. The Los Angeles County Housing Innovation Fund, LLC, a joint
venture between the Low Income Investment Fund, Century Housing Corporation, and the
Corporation for Supportive Housing, will administer the fund. The LACHIF can be used to
finance acquisition and predevelopment activities associated with affordable housing development.
The LACHIF can only be used for units that are reserved for households at or below 60% AMI as
defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Los Angeles-Long
Beach Metropolitan Statistical Area. Sixty percent of the LACHIF has been set aside to serve
households with incomes at 60% or below of AMI. Forty percent of the LACHIF has been set
aside to serve households with incomes at 35% or below of AMI. The maximum loan amount is
$5 million, which may include up to $750,000 for predevelopment activities. LACHIF loans are to
be paid back no later than 36 months after origination.
Eligible entities include the City, Non-Profit developers, For-Profit developers and Limited
Partnerships or Limited Liability Companies.

Program Objective: The City will make Non-Profit and For-Profit developers aware of the
availability of Los Angeles County Housing Innovation Fund financing and encourage its use
where feasible to facilitate the development of affordable housing.
         9.      Encourage Preservation of Existing Rental Housing Stock
Agency Responsible for Implementation: San Gabriel Community Development Department
Program Description: The City will continue to encourage preservation of the existing rental
housing stock and discourage condominium conversions, which can raise the cost of housing and
take affordable multiple-family rental housing off the market. To preserve the affordable rental
housing stock, the City’s policy is to require condominium conversions to comply with all current
development standards of the zones in which they are located, such as setbacks, parking and open
space. Because condominium conversions often occur in older rental developments, the burden of
bringing such properties into full compliance with contemporary development standards has acted
as a disincentive to conversion. There have been no condominium conversions in San Gabriel in
over 20 years.

condominium conversions and preserve the affordable rental housing stock.
         10.     Home Ownership Program
Agency Responsible for Implementation: Los Angeles County Community Development
Commission (LACDC).
Program Description: San Gabriel residents are eligible to participate in the Los Angeles County
Community Development Commission’s Home Ownership Program (HOP) funded under the
Federal HOME program to assist low-income households to purchase their first homes. HOP
provides loans of up to 20% of the initial purchase price or $60,000, whichever is least. The loans
are shared equity loans with no monthly payments and payable upon sale, transfer, or refinance of
the home. Under the program, eligible properties include single-family homes and attached or
detached condominiums or townhomes. The property must be owner-occupied for the life of the
loan. In addition, the borrower is required to have a minimum of 1% of the down payment and
complete an educational course in homeownership from an approved HUD counseling agency.
Source of Funding: Los Angeles County Community Development Commission HOME funds.
Program Objective: The City will continue to participate in the County’s Home Ownership
Program. The City will advertise the availability of the program through its website, newsletter, and
cable television channel as well as brochures.

Conserve Existing Affordable Housing
         11.     Code Enforcement
Program Description: Code enforcement efforts in San Gabriel focus on bringing substandard
housing units into compliance with City building and property maintenance codes. In 2002, the
City reorganized the Code Enforcement Division into a more proactive Neighborhood
Improvement Services Division incorporating traditional code enforcement with community
education and empowerment. Using an array of new tools, including concentrated code
enforcement, tree planting, cleanup programs, and other initiatives, this reorganization and more
proactive approach increases the City’s effectiveness in improving the quality of housing and
neighborhoods in San Gabriel. The City also increased the size of its Code Enforcement staff by
hiring an additional part-time Code Enforcement Officer.
Source of Funding: Community Development Block Grant; Department Budget
Program Objective: The Neighborhood Improvement Division will continue to bring its varied
resources to bear on enforcing City building and property maintenance codes, with an emphasis
on eliminating substandard housing conditions so that all San Gabriel residents may enjoy decent,
safe and sanitary housing.
         12.     Preservation of Assisted Housing Developments
Agency Responsible for Implementation: San Gabriel Community Development Department
Program Description: The preservation of existing affordable housing in the community is an
important goal for San Gabriel. Earlier analysis (see Section II.F) indicates that there are two
projects in the city with affordability covenants, although neither of these projects is at risk of
conversion. Las Casas Apartments is the only assisted multi-family development in the City and is
not at risk of conversion over the next ten years. The City will continue to monitor the status of
these projects as well as all future assisted developments to ensure their affordability controls are
maintained for the longest period possible.
Source of Funding: Department Budget
Program Objective: The City will continue to monitor the status of assisted residential
developments in San Gabriel by maintaining in close contact with projects owners.

         13.     Mixed-Use Zones
Agency Responsible for Implementation: San Gabriel Community Development Department
Program Description: Mixed-use developments with a combination of residential and commercial
uses are conditionally permitted in the commercial C-1 and C-3 and Mission District Village zones.
City of San Gabriel                                 V-11                          Housing Action Plan
Housing Element                                                                        September 2013

Specifically, multi-family residential uses are permitted on the second and third floors above
ground floor commercial or office uses. Ground floor multi-family residential uses are permitted in
mixed-use developments on a site in excess of three acres, subject to a CUP. In 2006, the City
further facilitated the development of mixed-use projects with the adoption of the Valley
Boulevard Specific Plan, which allows mixed-use projects by-right of up to five stories (as compared
to three stories with a CUP under the previous code), up to 3.0 floor area ratio (as compared to
1.0 previously) and densities in excess of 40 units per acre (as compared to 25 units per acre
previously). Since 2003, two mixed-use projects providing 24 units have been built, while another
providing 31 units is under construction. Another project with 11 units has been approved.
Source of Funding: Department Budget
Program Objective: The City will continue to promote development in the mixed-use areas. If
financial assistance is available, a focus of these funds will be to provide financial incentives for
development of affordable housing on sites where mixed-use is permitted. Incentives would likely
take the form of land write-down assistance, or assistance with development fees and off-site
development costs. In addition, the City offers density bonuses to mixed-use projects that include
units affordable to low- and/or moderate-income households. The City may also provide fee
reductions and development assistance for affordable units. The City will provide information
regarding mixed-use development opportunities on the website and will notify local affordable
housing developers annually.
         14.     Vacant and Underused Sites Inventory
Agency Responsible for Implementation: San Gabriel Community Development Department
Program Description: As part of the 2013 Housing Element update and as required by state law,
the City compiled an inventory of vacant and underused sites in all zones in which housing is
permitted or conditionally permitted. This inventory will be maintained and provided to
interested parties (including residents and developers), in conjunction with information on density
increases and other regulatory concessions available through the City’s density bonus program.
Source of Funding: Department Budget
Program Objective: The City will maintain a current inventory of vacant and underused sites
potentially available for residential development. This inventory will be made available to
interested individuals, including San Gabriel residents and residential developers. Specifically, the
City will utilize the site inventory to identify areas where lot consolidation is possible and
communicate this information to interested developers.

information clearinghouse for information on affordable, special needs, accessible, and emergency
housing within the County of Los Angeles. The project is managed by the Community
Development Commission of the County of Los Angeles, which is the umbrella agency that
includes the County's Housing Authority [HACoLA]. The City maintains a link on its website to
the Housing Resource Center.
Source of Funding: County of Los Angeles Housing Authority/Community Development

Program Objective: San Gabriel residents will continue to be made aware of and have access to
the referral and informational services offered by the Los Angeles County Housing Authority. The
City will continue to provide a link on its website to the Los Angeles County Housing Resource
Center website, which offers information about available housing assistance programs.
         16.     Inventory of Affordable Housing Funding Sources
Agency Responsible for Implementation: San Gabriel Community Development Department
Program Description: As part of its previous Housing Element, the City prepared a
comprehensive inventory of available sources of funds for affordable housing activities. The City
will update and maintain this inventory so it is available to prospective housing developers. City
staff identify and prepare applications for appropriate funding sources to support affordable
housing activities. As discussed in Chapter III, these sources include CDBG, Section 8 Rental
Assistance, the Mills Act program, and various state programs such as Low Income Housing Tax
Credits (LIHTC) and the Multi-family Housing Program.
Source of Funding: Department Budget
Program Objective: The City will update and maintain the inventory of affordable housing
funding sources and make it available to developers and will identify and apply for, when
appropriate, funding sources to support affordable housing activities.
         17.     Fair Housing
Agency Responsible for Implementation: Housing Rights Center.
Program Description: The Housing Rights Center provides the following client services: tenant
and landlord counseling; advocacy and collaboration in support of fair housing opportunities for
all; public outreach and education regarding fair housing rights; specialized property owner,
management and lender training; and discrimination complaint processing, investigation and
litigation.

San Gabriel has conducted an initial review of zoning code and building code requirements and
has not identified any barriers to the provision of accessible housing. In addition, a Reasonable
Accommodation ordinance was adopted in the previous planning period.
Source of Funding: Housing Rights Center
Program Objectives: The City will advertise the services of the Housing Rights Center through
the City’s newsletter, website and cable television channel. The City will continue to promote fair
housing practices, process requests for reasonable accommodation, and refer fair housing
complaints to the Housing Rights Center.

                        Evaluation of the 2008-2013 Housing Element
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the effectiveness of
the existing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies, and the
progress in implementing programs for the previous planning period. This appendix contains a
review the housing goals, policies, and programs of the previous housing element, adopted in
2010, and evaluates the degree to which these programs have been implemented during the
previous planning period, 2008 through 2013. This analysis also includes an assessment of the
appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies. The findings from this evaluation have been
instrumental in determining the City’s 2013-2021 Housing Implementation Program.
Table A-1 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing Element along with the
program objectives, accomplishments, and implications for future policies and actions.
Table A-2 evaluates the appropriateness of previous goals and policies, and identifies any changes
that are called for in response to the City’s experience during the past planning period.
Table A-3 presents the City’s progress in meeting the quantified objectives from the previous
Housing Element.

The detailed assumptions and methodology for the residential land inventory described in
Chapter III are provided below and summarized in Tables B-1, B-2 and B-3.
1.       Vacant Land
Table B-2 and Figure B-1 show buildable vacant parcels designated for residential development. All
parcels that are not considered feasible to develop due to small size, insufficient access, or are
dedicated to other use (such as required parking for adjacent uses) were excluded from this
inventory. The table is organized to show clusters of adjacent parcels that have potential for lot
consolidation. These parcels can accommodate 623 lower-income units, 132 moderate-income
units and 10 above-moderate units. The assumptions underlying these estimates are discussed
below.
Affordability Assumptions for Vacant or Underutilized Sites
Housing Element law (AB 2348 of 2004) provides “default densities” that are assumed to be
adequate to facilitate the production of lower-income housing. For San Gabriel and most
metropolitan cities, the default density is 30 units/acre. Potential new units in the land inventory
are allocated to income categories as follows:
         Lower-income: Mixed-use sites in the Valley Boulevard Specific Plan since the allowable
         density is higher than the default density.
         Moderate income: Sites in multi-family zones (R-2 and R-3) and zones that allow mixed-use
         (except Valley Boulevard Specific Plan) since the base densities in these zones are below the
         default density, and market-rate apartments are within the moderate-income range.
         Above-moderate income: Sites in single-family zones (R-1 and R-1A)
Realistic Capacity
In order to estimate the realistic capacity of vacant sites, the following assumptions were used:
         Single-family (R-1) sites. One unit per lot is assumed for buildable lots of at least 5,000
         square feet. For the two large parcels (1/2 acre or more) a density of 6 units/acre is
         assumed.
         Medium density (R-2) sites. A density of up to 11 units/acre (excluding density bonus) is
         allowed in the R-2 zone. Analysis of projects built or approved during the previous
         planning period found an average density of 10.1 units/acre, therefore the vacant land
         inventory is based on this average unless special circumstances or constraints require
         modification. All but two of the R-2 projects built or approved in the previous planning
         period were small sites of less than 1/2 acre, therefore the same density assumption is used
         for all sites regardless of size.

         High density (R-3) sites. A density of up to 25 units/acre (excluding density bonus) is
         allowed in the R-3 zone. Analysis of projects built or approved during the previous
         planning period found an average density of 17.3 units/acre for all projects. Larger projects
         of 1/2 acre or more had an average density of 24.4 units/acre, while projects smaller than
         1/2 acre averaged 16.3 units/acre. Based on this record, a density of 16 units/acre is
         assumed for sites smaller than 1/2 acre while 24 units/acre is assumed for larger parcels
         unless special circumstances or constraints require modification.
         Mixed-use sites. Mixed-use development is allowed in the C-1 and C-3 zones as well as in
         the Mission District and Valley Boulevard Specific Plans. Residential densities up to 25
         units/acre (excluding density bonus) are permitted in the C-1, C-3 and Mission District
         zones, while there is no density limit in the Valley Boulevard Specific Plan. Instead,
         development intensity is regulated by floor area ratio. The areas where mixed-use is
         permitted also allow development of stand-alone commercial projects at floor area ratios
         ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, depending on zone and lot size. Analysis of previously approved
         projects shows that projects of less than one acre in the zones with a maximum density of
         25 units/acre (i.e., C-1, C-3 and the Mission District Specific Plan) had an average density
         of 28.3 units/acre, while the larger project had a density of 66 units/acre. Two mixed-use
         projects were approved in the Valley Boulevard Specific Plan. The smaller project was less
         than one acre and had a density of 30 units/acre while the larger project was approximately
         two acres with a density of 78 units/acre. These projects are considered representative of
         future development potential and therefore provide the basis for density assumptions for
         vacant sites allowing mixed-use development. While stand-alone commercial development
         is allowed in areas where mixed-use is permitted, it is likely that most future projects in
         these areas will include a residential component due to the floor area ratio bonus that
         mixed-use projects receive compared to commercial-only projects.
         The majority of the development capacity for lower-income housing is represented by three
         high-potential sites in the Valley Boulevard Specific Plan. These sites are described below.
                 1029 E. Valley Blvd. This 2.3-acre parcel is located on the north side of Valley
                 Boulevard and is well suited to accommodate retail, residential and mixed use, and
                 is close to the key intersection of Valley and San Gabriel boulevards.

                 Valley Blvd./Bencamp St. These contiguous vacant parcels encompass 5.5 acres
                 and have dual frontage on Valley Boulevard and Bencamp Street.
                 205 E. Valley Blvd. This 0.7-acre property features frontage on both Valley
                 Boulevard and Palm Avenue, and is one of the few vacant lots left on this bustling
                 corridor. The site is within a mile of Interstate 10 and is also served by public
                 transit for easy access.
2.       Underutilized Land
Table B-3 and Figure B-2 show underutilized parcels with the capacity for additional residential
development or redevelopment. As with vacant sites, all parcels that are not considered feasible to
develop during this planning period due to small size, insufficient access, or are dedicated to uses
that are considered unlikely to be relocated (such as required parking for adjacent uses or public
works infrastructure) were excluded from this inventory. Parcels are also organized in groups to
show where lot consolidation is possible. As described in Program 6, incentives are provided to
encourage lot consolidation. The most significant potential exists on properties currently used for
nurseries since the value of structures is relatively small compared to land value. All told, these
parcels could accommodate 277 moderate-income units. The affordability and density assumptions
underlying these estimates are the same as described above for vacant sites.

                                 Public Participation Summary
This summary of Housing Element public-participation efforts describes opportunities for public
involvement along with an explanation of how public comments were incorporated into the
Housing Element. In addition, prior to the adoption hearings all interested parties were given the
opportunity to review the recommended revisions.
Public participation is an important component of the planning process, and this update to the
Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties numerous opportunities for
review and comment. Public notices of all Housing Element meetings and public hearings were
published in the local newspaper in advance of each meeting, as well as posting the notices on the
City’s website. The draft Housing Element was made available for review at City Hall, posted on
the City’s website, as well as at the Public Library. The document was also made available to
housing advocates, and nonprofit organizations representing the interests of lower-income persons
and special needs groups. The following organizations with an interest in housing for lower-income
households were included in the notice of public meetings for this Housing Element update:

Housing Element                                                                       September 2013

Issues raised during the public meetings are discussed below.
    •    What is the process for addressing comments from HCD?
         Typically HCD arranges a phone call with City staff to ask questions or provide suggestions
         during the 60-day public review period. The City then has the option to submit
         supplemental information to address the question. If HCD finds that the element meets all
         the requirements of state law, a letter is sent stating that the element will be in compliance
         when adopted and submitted to HCD for final review. If unresolved issues remain, the
         review letter will identify changes needed to bring the element into compliance.
    •    Why is the City’s RHNA allocation higher than in the previous cycle?
         The RHNA is based on statewide and regional growth forecasts, which are revised
         periodically. In the SCAG region, the growth forecast was updated as part of the 2012
         Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). Under state law, consistency is maintained between
         the RTP and the RHNA by using the same growth forecast as the foundation for each.
         Since the growth forecast changes over time, each RHNA cycle normally results in a
         different allocation than the prior cycle. Factors that are considered in the growth forecast
         and RHNA include population trends (e.g., fertility, migration, household formation rates)
         economic and employment trends, income levels, vacancy rates, demolition rates, etc. One
         of the unusual factors in the new RHNA cycle was the effect of the recession on housing
         foreclosures, and housing needs allocations were adjusted to account for high vacancy rates
         in some jurisdictions, particularly the Inland Empire.
    •    Can RHNA allocations be challenged?
         State law establishes the process regional planning agencies must follow in preparing the
         RHNA. In Los Angeles County, the Southern California Association of Governments
         (SCAG) is responsible for administering the RHNA process. State law establishes
         procedures for developing methodology, public review, consideration of requests for
         modification, and final appeals for the RHNA allocations. Local governments are provided
         opportunities to participate in this process at each step. While the RHNA allocation to San
         Gabriel is slightly higher than the previous cycle, it remains consistent with the City’s
         capacity for new housing.
    •    How can the City address the growing need for senior housing?
         The needs for senior housing are addressed in several ways through the City’s zoning
         regulations. For example, second units can provide a low-cost option for single elderly
         persons or can provide additional income for retired homeowners to help them stay in
         their homes. Zoning regulations also allow a variety of alternative housing options for
         seniors such as residential care facilities, assisted living, and convalescent care facilities.

    •    Do live/work and mixed-use developments help to address the City’s housing needs?
         Yes, these types of projects provide additional housing options and can satisfy a portion of
         the City’s need. Mixed use developments are allowed in the Valley Boulevard Specific Plan,
         the Mission District Specific Plan, as well as the C-1 and C-3 commercial districts.

 San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments Regional Homeless Services Strategy
In 2008 the San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments initiated a study of homeless needs and
potential strategies to address those needs (see Section II.E.6 for further discussion). The effort
initially divided the study area into six sub-areas (“clusters”), as shown in Figures II-3 and II-4 of
the Housing Element. However, as work progressed, the study areas were collapsed from six to
four clusters. The revised cluster areas are shown in the following exhibit.
