INTRODUCTION
                                                               R  OSEMEAD          G  ENERAL         PL  AN
E             nvision Rosemead as
              a city where people
              have many options for
housing, employment, shopping,
and recreation. Envision a city
where businesses create a strong
economic foundation for high-
quality municipal services, and
where parks and recreational
facilities offer opportunities for a
diverse population to exercise and
interact. Envision a city where
schools and teachers educate and
inspire youth, and where the
natural environment is protected
and enhanced. This is the vision             Drawing by Caryn Yip, Muscatel Intermediate School student
for Rosemead; the General Plan
will help the City realize this vision.
Since its incorporation in 1959, Rosemead has become an
increasingly racially and ethnically diverse community.
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the City’s population was
approximately 49 percent Asian and 41 percent Hispanic,
which is significantly higher than the State population
percentage for both groups. An important component of this
General Plan will be to address specific issues to meet the needs
of Rosemead’s diverse population.
                                                                                                    P A G E 1 - 1

General Plan Visions
With this General Plan, the City seeks to:
       Enhance the commercial areas along key corridors, and
        most specifically Garvey Avenue and Valley Boulevard;
       Create an economically viable downtown that blends
        retail, office, and residential uses in a walkable,
        attractive setting;
       Enhance parks and recreational space in underserved
        neighborhoods;
       Accommodate the demand for quality mixed-use
        development that can contribute to commercial growth
        and enhance opportunities for higher-density
        residential development;
       Protect homeowner investments and the availability of
        well-maintained, relatively affordable housing units;
       Minimize the impact of traffic associated with growth
        within the San Gabriel Valley and broader region.
Adopted by City Council on October 14, 2008, the General Plan
establishes the framework for moving from the Rosemead of
today toward the desired community of the future. This
General Plan guides the City to the year 2025 by establishing
goals and policies that address land use, circulation, safety, and
open space. Each of these issues affects quality of life in
Rosemead and the economic health of the community.
Incorporating input from community leaders and businesses
into the General Plan works to retain the qualities that make
the City unique, responds to the dynamics of growth in the Los
Angeles region, and meets the changing needs of residents.
Implementation of the General Plan will ensure that future
development projects in the City are consistent with the
community’s goals, and that adequate urban services are
available to meet the needs of all new development. As
Rosemead moves towards 2025, the City, its residents, and the
business community are committed to implementing a long-
range plan that enhances the physical, economic, and human
resources of this diverse and community-oriented City.

Rosemead’s                                         Planning
Area
The City of Rosemead is 5.2 square miles in size and located in
the San Gabriel Valley, approximately 11 miles east of
downtown Los Angeles. Rosemead has easy accessibility to
several freeways that connect it to the City to Los Angeles and
the larger Los Angeles metropolitan region. The San
Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10) runs east-west through the
City, and the Pomona Freeway (State Route 60) runs through
the southern portion (see Figure 1-1 and Figure 1-2).
Interstate 710 to the west provides direct access to Long Beach,
and Interstate 605 to the east connects to Huntington Beach.
Interstate 210 to the north provides east-west connection to the
San Fernando Valley and the Inland Empire.
History of Rosemead
The Rosemead area was settled by Gabrieleno Native
Americans prior to the arrival of the Spanish, who established
the first mission in the San Gabriel Valley
in 1771. The area that is now considered
the City of Rosemead was part of the San
Gabriel Mission during the Spanish
colonial period until the early 1850s.
Twenty-four ranchos made up the
Mission; Native Americans associated
with the San Gabriel Mission settled on
the ranchos and raised cattle and planted
grain and grapes.1 John and Harriet
Guess arrived in the area in 1852 and
were one of early white American settlers
in Rosemead. Their property included
the Savannah Ranch, which is located on
the current Savannah School site.                                           Early settlers: The Guess family
Leonard J. and Amanda Rose were other
early settlers, who established Rose’s Meadow (Rosemead
Ranch) as a winery, as well as a breeding and training area for
horses. The Rosemead area included these two ranches, as well
as Potrero Ranch, which was owned by Richard Garvey. The
area was known for small farms, as well as chicken and rabbit
ranches. The City was incorporated in 1959 with a population
of 15,476. Forty-seven years after incorporation, the City of
Rosemead had an estimated population of 57,144.2

General Plan Purpose
and Scope
Every jurisdiction in California is required to adopt a general
plan and update this plan at regular intervals. The purpose of
the general plan is to anticipate and plan for “the physical
development of the county or city, and any land outside its
boundaries which bears relation to its planning” (California
Government Code §65300).
Rosemead’s General Plan might be
compared to a roadmap, in that this
plan sets a course for the future.
This “map” first describes the issues
facing Rosemead today, and then
sets the course, expressed through
goals, policies, and implementation
programs, to achieve the desired
Rosemead of the future. The
primary benefit of long-range
planning is that such planning
enhances the City’s ability to control
how Rosemead will look and
function as time passes. Many of
the goals and policies contained in
this plan will improve and sustain
neighborhoods, foster a better                             Memorial near City Hall
business climate, and enhance the
natural environment. The links forged within the plan between
land uses and the transportation, infrastructure, and public
services networks will provide the flexibility needed to
accommodate growth and change over the life of the plan. The
General Plan also focuses on the connections between
residential neighborhoods and adjacent commercial centers
that may lead to a healthier lifestyle for residents by creating
opportunities to walk within the City that did not exist before.
To be considered comprehensive, this General Plan must
address many issues that are related to and influence land use
decisions. Specifically, in addition to land use, State law
requires that the General Plan address circulation, housing, the
conservation of natural resources, the preservation of open
space, the noise environment, and the protection of public
safety (Government Code §65302). Jurisdictions may prepare
and adopt any other General Plan element or address any other
topics of particular relevance or interest to that community,
with the understanding that these optional elements must be
                                                                                           P A G E 1 - 9

implemented with the same vigor – and are subject to the same
legal scrutiny – as the mandatory elements or topics.
The Rosemead General Plan discusses these issues in five
chapters, called elements. These elements are:
       The Land Use Element, which
        focuses on the built environment
        and pulls together issues and goals
        from the other elements, laying
        out the framework for balancing
        development         with      broader
        community aims.
       The      Circulation       Element,
        which addresses issues related to
        vehicular circulation, parking
        management,         public     transit,
        walking, biking, and trails.
       The Resource Management
        Element, which examines both
        the natural and human-made
                                                   Walkable Rosemead Boulevard
        environments, and establishes
        policies to protect those resources that distinguish and
        define Rosemead. Topics addressed in this element
        include parks, recreation, open space, community
        facilities, air quality, water resources and conservation,
        and energy conservation.
       The Public Safety Element, which identifies hazards
        present in the community and defines ways for proper
        planning and emergency response services to mitigate
        the hazards including flooding.
       The Noise Element identifies community noise
        concerns and includes policies and programs to
        minimize noise impacts in Rosemead.
       The Housing Element identifies current and future
        housing. Rosemead’s Housing Element is updated
        every five years as required by State law. The City
        currently has an adopted and certified Housing Element
        dated 2000. This element is due to be revised in 2010.
Table 1-1 shows the relationship between the six elements of
the Rosemead General Plan and the State-mandated elements.

The General Plan also includes Implementation Actions,
located within each element, identifying the specific actions the
City will undertake to implement goals and policies. Ongoing
review of these Implementation Programs allows the City to
adjust programs and planned actions to respond to new or
refocused priorities, to address annual budget constraints
and/or opportunities, and to account for changes in the
physical conditions or economic circumstances of the
community (for example, occurrence of a natural disaster).
Element Structure
Each of the five elements is organized according to the
following format:
      Introduction
      Issues, Goals, and Policies
      Policy Map and Plan
The Introduction of each element describes the focus and the
purpose of the element. The relationship of the element to
other General Plan elements is also specified.

The Issues, Goals, and Policies section is based on input
received from the community, members of the City Council and
Planning Commission, and City staff. Issues represent the
needs or concerns important to the community. Goals are
overall statements of community desires and consist of broad
statements of purpose or direction. Policies serve as guides to
the City Council and City staff in reviewing development
proposals and making other decisions that affects future growth
and development in Rosemead.
The Policy Map and Plan section provides an overview of the
City’s course of action to implement identified goals and
policies. This section also includes Implementation Actions,
which identifies specific actions to achieve the goals and plans
identified in each General Plan element.
Community
Participation
During the General Plan update process that began
in 2003, the City created a four-page survey that
asked residents and business owners in Rosemead
what they think is special about Rosemead, and
what changes they would like to see in the next 15
to 20 years. The survey was also available for
downloading on the City’s website. Respondents
were asked to complete the survey and email or
mail it to the City of Rosemead, or drop it off at City
Hall. The City received 95 completed surveys. In
addition, the Mayor and City Council members
were interviewed to provide direction for the Plan,
and to identify the issues and opportunities that
will enhance the quality of life in Rosemead. Their
responses were used to draft goals and policies for       Example of Rosemead’s single family residential areas
each General Plan element.
Public meetings were conducted before the Planning
Commission and City Council during the spring and summer of
2007, with many residents attending to share their ideas and
comments.
In 2009, the City initiated a minor General Plan update to re-
address the mixed-use corridor designations. As part of the
2009 update, a City Council subcommittee comprised of two
City Council representatives met with Planning Division staff
and planning professionals to consider changing the land use
designations for some areas along Rosemead’s corridors. The
subcommittee evaluated a number of land use options and

ultimately presented the findings at a joint Planning
Commission – City Council study session on September 22,
2009. Both the Planning Commission and the City Council
endorsed a concept and directed the Planning staff to modify
the General Plan in accordance with the concept. A public
hearing was conducted for the Draft General Plan on March 1,
2010 before the City of Rosemead Planning Commission and on
April 13, 2010 before the City of Rosemead City Council.
Related                        Plans                   and
Programs
State law places the General Plan at the top of the land use
planning regulation hierarchy. Several local ordinances and
other City plans must conform to General Plan policy and work
to implement the Plan. Also, regional governmental agencies,
such as the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) and the South Coast Air Quality Management District
(SCAQMD), have been established to address regional planning
issues such as air quality, transportation, affordable housing,
and habitat conservation. These regional government agencies
have prepared a number of regional policy documents and
plans that effect Rosemead. The following section describes
ordinances, plans, and programs that must be consulted in
association with the General Plan in development and planning
decisions.
Rosemead Zoning Ordinance
The Zoning Ordinance, the primary tool used to implement the
General Plan, regulates development type and intensity
citywide. Development regulations imposed include those
setting limits on building height, requiring setbacks, and
specifying the percentage of a site that must be landscaped.
California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted
by the State legislature in response to a public mandate for
thorough environmental analysis of projects impacting the
environment. The provisions of the law and environmental
review procedure are described in the CEQA Law and
Guidelines. CEQA is the instrument for ensuring that
environmental impacts of local development projects are
appropriately assessed and mitigated.
SCAG Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
undertakes regional planning for the six-county SCAG region of
                                                                          P A G E 1 - 1 3

Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Imperial and
Ventura counties. SCAG’s efforts focus on developing regional
strategies to minimize traffic congestion, protect environmental
quality, and provide adequate housing. The Regional
Comprehensive Plan and Guide sets forth broad goals intended
to be implemented by participating local and regional
jurisdictions and the SCAQMD. SCAG has adopted companion
documents to the Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide,
most notably the Regional Transportation Plan.
California Clean Air Act
In 1988, the California Legislature enacted the California Clean
Air Act that requires the SCAQMD to prepare a plan to attain
state ambient air quality standards in the South Coast Air
Basin. State air standards are generally more stringent than
their federal equivalents, and attaining them will require
encompassing and effective plan measures. The Clean Air Act
requires reductions from all sources of pollution: large and
small industry, mobile sources, household use of polluting
products, and the transportation sector. The Act also requires
the Basin Plan to be revised and updated every three years.
The Clean Air Act grants new authority to the State's local air
pollution control districts to adopt and enforce transportation
control measures. In accordance with the Clean Air Act, areas
with "severe" air pollution, which are defined as those that
cannot reach State standards by 1999 and include the South
Coast Air Basin, are required to include transportation control
measures to achieve an average vehicle ridership of 1.5 persons
or more during weekday commute hours (Refer to the
Circulation Element for discussion of the City policy with
respect to average vehicle ridership.).
Similarly, the Clean Air Act calls for no net increases in vehicle
emissions after 1997 and requires the SCAQMD to develop
programs to control emissions from indirect sources or traffic
attractors such as housing developments, office parks, and
shopping centers. The mitigation of traffic-generated air
pollution from these sources will need to be closely linked with
land use decisions.
Congestion Management Plan
The Congestion Management Plan (CMP) is a program adopted
by the State Legislature and approved by the State voters in
1990 through Proposition 111. The CMP was created for the
following purposes:
       To link land use, transportation, and air quality
        decisions;

       To develop a partnership among transportation
        decision-makers that devises appropriate transportation
        solutions including all modes of travel; and
       To propose transportation projects that are eligible to
        compete for state gas tax funds.
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(MTA) is responsible for preparing the County’s CMP. The
MTA is required by State law to monitor local implementation
of all CMP elements. Local jurisdictions are required to
monitor arterial congestion levels, monitor transit services
along certain corridors, and implement an adopted trip
reduction ordinance and land use analysis program. In
addition, jurisdictions are required to track and report all new
development activity.
Regional Transportation Plan
The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is a component of the
Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide prepared by SCAG to
address regional issues, goals, objectives, and policies for the
Southern California region into the early part of the twenty-first
century. The RTP, which SCAG periodically updates to address
changing conditions in the southland, has been developed with
active participation from local agencies throughout the region,
elected officials, the business community, community groups,
private institutions, and private citizens. The RTP sets broad
goals for the region and provides strategies to reduce problems
related to congestion and mobility. In recognition of the close
relationship between the traffic and air quality issues, the
assumptions, goals, and programs contained in the RTP
parallel those used to prepare the Air Quality Management
Plan.
Air Quality Management Plan
The South Coast Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) is a
comprehensive program designed to bring the South Coast Air
Basin, of which Rosemead is a part, into compliance with all
federal and state air quality standards. The AQMP was
prepared and adopted by the SCAG and SCAQMD. Since motor
vehicles are a major source of air pollution, the AQMP places
substantial emphasis on reducing motor vehicle miles traveled.
The AQMP foresees cities taking an increasing role in solving
air pollution problems through adoption of trip reduction
ordinances at the local level. The cities can take an increasing
role through the adoption and implementation of Air Quality
Elements and the implementation of land use policies that
reduce individual vehicle use.

National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
As part of a multi-pronged effort to improve the quality of
water resources nationwide, the federal government authorized
the State Regional Water Quality Control Board and its regional
offices, such as the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control
Board, to set up programs to implement National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) goals. Under the
NPDES Stormwater Permit issued to the County of Los Angeles
and Rosemead as co-permittees, most new development
projects in the City are required to incorporate measures to
minimize pollutant levels in stormwater runoff. Compliance is
required at the time that construction permits are issued, as
well as over the long term through periodic inspections.
NPDES requirements are adopted as part of the Rosemead
Municipal Code, and are enforced by Los Angeles County, the
State Water Resource Control Board, and the City’s Public
Works Department.

Introduction
 R             osemead accommodates a diversity of land uses
               to maintain a balanced community with vibrant
               residential neighborhoods, a healthy economic
               base, and quality services for residents and
visitors. The Land Use Element establishes policies for the
types and location of land uses citywide. The Zoning Ordinance
implements these policies by establishing detailed use
regulations and development standards for all properties.
State planning law requires that the Land Use Element
designate "the proposed general distribution and general
location and extent of the uses of the land" for a variety of
purposes (Government Code Section 65302[a]). Through maps
and text, this Element defines the distribution and intensity of
development      for    residential,  commercial,    industrial,
parks/open space, and public facility land uses within
Rosemead and its sphere of influence areas. Finally, the
Element describes the relationship between General Plan land
use policy, zoning, and other plans.

Relationship to Other
Elements and Plans
The Land Use Element provides the framework for all other
General Plan elements, as the manner in which land is used in
Rosemead affects:
       The location and design of roadways, bicycle paths, and
        pedestrian walkways;
       The location, type, and design of new housing
        development (Housing Element); and
       Park location and use, and environmental resource
        protection and use (Resources Management Element).
Although the Land Use Element is often the most referred
element in the General Plan, it represents only one part of the
General Plan. Coordination between and among all of the
General Plan Elements is required to comprehensively address
long-range community goals.
According to State law as revised in 2007 (AB162), land use
elements shall identify and annually review the areas covered
by the General Plan that are subject to flooding as identified by
floodplain mapping by either the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the Department of Water
Resources (DWR). This is accomplished by reference to the
Public Safety Element, where flooding is discussed in further
detail.
Zoning Ordinance
The City's zoning ordinance, which is part of the Municipal
Code, divides the City into areas called zoning districts. The
zoning ordinance establishes regulations for each district with
respect to permitted uses, allowable density, building height,
development character, etc. The zoning ordinance consists of a
map that delineates the district boundaries, plus text that
explains each district’s purpose, specifies permitted and
conditional uses, and establishes development, maintenance,
and performance standards. The zoning ordinance serves as the
primary implementation tool for the Land Use Element. Under
California law, the zoning ordinance must be consistent with
the General Plan.

Regional Comprehensive Plan and
Guide
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
undertakes regional planning efforts for the six-county SCAG
region consisting of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino, Ventura, and Imperial counties. SCAG's planning
efforts focus on developing strategies to minimize traffic
congestion, protect environmental quality, and provide
adequate housing throughout the region. The Regional
Comprehensive Plan and Guide – developed with active
participation from local agencies, elected officials, the business
community, community groups, private institutions, and
private citizens – sets forth broad goals and objectives intended
to be implemented by participating jurisdictions and agencies
such the South Coast Air Quality Management District and Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Rosemead Downtown Vision Plan
The City is currently considering a Rosemead Downtown Vision
Plan. This plan focuses on urban design opportunities on
Valley Boulevard. The Plan calls for:
    • Enhancing existing resources – add landscaping and
        streetscape along Valley Boulevard and encouraging
        “focal point” buildings at opportunity sites or parcels.
    • Creating potential districts – identify opportunity
        parcels along Valley Boulevard near Walnut Grove
        Avenue and Temple City Boulevard to create image-
        making public spaces and focal point buildings.
    • Emphasizing public space – expand the use of public
        space including the use of courtyards, plazas, outdoor
        dining, and pedestrian friendly retail.
    • Enhance Wayfinding – improve signage and
        placemaking images to encourage the feel of separate
        districts and distinct places along Valley Boulevard.
Measuring Density and
Intensity
While people generally understand land use terms like
“residential,” “commercial,” and “industrial,” State law requires
a clear and concise description of these categories. In addition,
                                                                               P A G E 2 - 3

population and intensity standards must be specified. To
describe the intensity of use – how much development exists on
a property – land use planners have developed the quantitative
measures of density and intensity.
The term density describes the development capacity of
residential land. The General Plan describes density in terms of
dwelling units per net acre of land (du/ac), exclusive of present
or planned streets and other public rights-of-way. Density is
also used to describe population density in terms of the number
of persons per net acre.
Development intensity refers to the extent of development on a
parcel of land or lot. Intensity may be calculated using several
measures, such as the total building floor area, building height,
floor-area ratio, or the percent of lot coverage. The General
Plan uses floor-area ratio, or FAR, as a measure of non-
residential intensity. The floor-area ratio is the ratio between
the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot and the total
land area of that lot. This measure does not include area within
parking structures.
                                                                     This diagram illustrates how FAR

                                                                     FAR is determined by dividing the
                                                                     gross floor area of all buildings on a
                                                                     lot by the land area of that lot. For
                                                                     example, a 20,000 square foot
                                                                     building on a 40,000 square foot lot
                                                                     yields an FAR of 0.5:1. A 0.5:1 FAR
                                                                     allows a single-story building which
                                                                     covers half the lot, or a two-story
                                                                     building with reduced lot coverage.
Land Use Plan
This Land Use Element addresses how properties will be
developed over time and the extent to which private and public
redevelopment efforts will change, intensify, or otherwise
modify uses of property citywide. This section describes the
planned distribution and development intensities of all land
uses, and identifies specific goals the City will pursue relative to
each designated use.

Land Use Policy Map
To maintain the desired balance of uses in the community and
achieve goals regarding housing, economic development, parks,
and education, the City will make land use decisions in
conformance with the Land Use Policy Map, illustrated in
Figure 2-1. The Land Use Policy Map provides a two-
dimensional description of land use policy, indicating the
preferred location and types of permitted uses throughout the
City.
Land Use Categories
This Land Use Element designates five major categories of land
use: (1) residential, (2) commercial, (3) office/light industrial,
(4) mixed-use, and (5) public facilities. The residential
designation is further subdivided into three density ranges:
Low, Medium, and High. To provide for a diversity of mixed-
use approaches, the Mixed-Use designation includes three
subcategories:     Residential/Commercial,      High      Density
Residential/ Commercial, and Industrial/Commercial.
Table 2-1 summarizes the density and intensity associated
with each land use category and the aggregate acreage for each.
The table indicates a maximum density or intensity for each
category, which indicates the maximum development potential
of any individual parcel. However, not every parcel in
Rosemead will be developed to the maximum density or
intensity due to physical and other constraints such as public
right-of-way needs, placement of buildings, zoning
requirements, market desires, and other factors. Also, many
residential neighborhoods in Rosemead are fully developed and
not expected to experience any significant new development or
“recycling” where an existing structure is removed and a new
structure is built in its place. Thus, Table 2-1 also indicates
typical densities and intensities that can be expected over the
life of this General Plan. Altogether, these factors are used to
estimate the possible buildout capacity of the City in terms of
population, housing units, and square feet of commercial,
industrial, and other nonresidential uses. The typical densities
and intensities are for planning purposes only.              Any
development proposal involving a density/intensity in excess of
the minimum but equal to or below the maximum should not
require a General Plan Amendment.

Residential Categories
Three land use categories are established to accommodate a
range of housing types and densities. Preservation and
enhancement of single-family residential neighborhoods is a
key goal. New development must be compatible with and
complement established residential neighborhoods. In
residential areas, in addition to the primary residential use,
                                                                                                     P A G E 2 - 9

accessory structures, group homes, religious and charitable
organizations are permitted consistent with State law and
zoning ordinance requirements.
Low Density Residential
The Low Density Residential (LDR) land use
category is characterized by low-density
residential      neighborhoods       consisting
primarily of detached single-family dwellings
on individual lots. The minimum permitted
density is 0 dwelling units per acre. The
maximum permitted density is 7.0 dwelling
units per acre. The typical population density
is approximately 28 persons per acre.
Medium Density Residential
The Medium Density Residential (MDR) land
use category allows for densities of up to 12          Low Density Single Family Residential Development
units per acre with a minimum of 0 dwelling
units per acre. Housing types within this
density range include single-family detached homes on smaller
lots, duplexes, and attached units. The typical population
density is approximately 34 persons per acre.
High Density Residential
The High Density Residential (HDR) category
accommodates many forms of attached housing −
triplexes,      fourplexes,     apartments,        and
condominiums/ townhouses − and small-lot or
clustered detached units. The maximum permitted
density is 30 units per acre with a minimum of 0
dwelling units per acre, and the typical population
density is 79 persons per acre.
Commercial Categories                                             Southern California Edison building
Businesses in Rosemead’s commercial districts
provide important services to residents and
contribute substantially to the City’s tax revenue
base. The three Commercial categories are intended
to support business activity and to provide incentives
to property owners to improve areas that function
below their economic potential.
Commercial
The Commercial designation applies to retail and
service commercial centers located along major
arterials in the City: (1) Valley Boulevard west of
                                                                         Commercial properties

Permitted uses include a broad range of retail, office, and
service uses that serve local and regional needs. Prohibited
uses include warehousing, manufacturing, industrial uses, and
similar uses. The maximum permitted FAR is 0.35:1.
Overnight accommodations, such as hotels, may be developed
up to maximum permitted FAR of 1.0:1 if their projects include
higher design standards, the “required hotel amenities” and a
minimum of two “additional hotel amenities” as identified in
Table 2-2. If a hotel project does not meet the amenities in
Table 2-2, they can only build up to 0.35:1 FAR.

Note:
a) To obtain higher FAR standard (maximum permitted 1.0:1 FAR), projects must provide all of the
   amenities listed under the Required Hotel Amenities column and a minimum of two amenities listed
   under the Additional Hotel Amenities column.
Development approaches for Commercial designations include
multi-story structures with underground or structured parking.
Where       commercial          development        abuts      residential
neighborhoods, new projects must be designed with
sensitivities to the residential uses in terms of massing, siting of
parking and loading facilities, and lighting.

Mixed-Use Categories
Rosemead has established three Mixed-Use categories to
provide options for innovative approaches to land use and
development. These categories allow for a mix of land uses in
the same building, on the same parcel of land, or side by side
within the same area. Such complementary use stimulates
business activity, encourages pedestrian patronage, and
provides a broader range of options to property owners to
facilitate the preservation, re-use and redevelopment of
structures.
Mixed-Use Residential/Commercial
Generally mixed-use development performs best when it is
located near other mixed-use development. This configuration
gives the residents more retail and office choices located and
designed for pedestrian activity. Similarly,
business may prefer to locate near each other to
gain the synergistic benefits of serving the same
clientele. As such, the mixed-use designations
are located in such a manner to maximize or
capitalize on that synergy.
The       Mixed-Use     Residential/Commercial
category allows vertically or horizontally mixed
commercial, office, and residential uses, with an
emphasis on retail uses along the ground floor.
Pedestrian connections among the uses, and as                   Office Development
appropriate to surrounding neighborhoods,
should be provided. The Mixed-Use designation will allow for
mixed use and commercial infill development. Further, parcels
may be assembled and consolidated to create larger, integrated
development sites. All mixed-use projects are also subject to
review and compliance with the City’s adopted mixed-use
design guidelines.
This designation applies to areas of Rosemead with historically
less intensive commercial and office development. The Mixed-
Use Residential/Commercial category is located on Valley
Boulevard between Muscatel Avenue and Valley Boulevard, and
on Garvey Avenue between Charlotte Avenue and Walnut
Grove Avenue. Residential densities are limited to a maximum
of 25 to 30 units per acre. For stand-alone commercial use and
integrated mixed-use projects, the maximum permitted FAR is
1.6:1. The typical population density is approximately 119
persons per acre.
                                                                                    P A G E 2 - 1 5

Mixed-Use High Density Residential/Commercial
Similar to the Mixed-Use Residential/Commercial category, the
Mixed-Use High Density Residential/Commercial category
permits vertically or horizontally mixed-use commercial, office,
and residential uses, but greater residential densities are
permitted and encouraged. Retail uses shall be emphasized
along the ground floor of street frontages, and pedestrian
connections among the uses and surrounding neighborhoods
should be provided.
This designation applies to the eastern end of Valley Boulevard
and south of Garvey Avenue, just west of the eastern boundary.
Residential densities are limited to a maximum of 36 to 60
units per acre. For stand-alone commercial use and integrated
mixed-use projects, the maximum permitted FAR is 2:1. The
typical population density is approximately 191 persons per
acre.
Mixed-Use Industrial/Commercial
The Mixed-Use Industrial/Commercial category accommodates
light industry, research and development, and office uses. The
emphasis is on businesses that provide career-oriented and
trade jobs. Commercial uses should be limited to those that
support the primary industrial and office uses.
Areas designated for Mixed-Use Industrial/Commercial are
limited to properties along San Gabriel Boulevard south of
Hellman Avenue to Park Street, along San Gabriel Avenue
south of the SCE easement to Rush Street, and on Garvey
Avenue from Walnut Grove to Muscatel Avenue (south side of
Garvey Avenue) or City limit (north side of Garvey Avenue).
The maximum FAR is 2.5:1. Site design shall take into
consideration any adjacent residential neighborhoods with
regard to parking lot entrances, location of parking and loading
facilities, building massing, and lighting.

Cemetery
This category applies to the Savannah Memorial Park Cemetery
(aka El Monte Cemetery) property located along Valley                     Rosemead City Hall

associated with a cemetery, as defined specifically in the zoning
ordinance.
Goals and Policies
These Land Use Element goals and policies address
four citywide issues that include: (1) enhancing and
maintaining existing single-family neighborhoods; (2)
providing housing opportunities for all segments of the
population; (3) preserving and encouraging a variety of
commercial and industrial activities; and (4)
revitalizing underperforming commercial corridors.
Single-Family Neighborhoods                                               Open Space
In some neighborhoods, apartments and townhomes have
replaced older single-family residences. This transition has
generally improved neighborhoods with the introduction of
higher-quality housing.       However, it has also created
neighborhoods where single-family residences are directly
adjacent to apartments and condominiums, and residents have
                                                                                 P A G E 2 - 1 7

expressed concern regarding privacy and the change in
neighborhood character.
Maintaining housing conditions and protecting the privacy of
single-story homes are key challenges in established single-
family residential neighborhoods. House sizes and heights
have increased over time, leading to inconsistency within
neighborhoods when newer homes are constructed adjacent to
or between older homes. Many of the larger, multi-story homes
have a line of sight into an adjacent home or back yard. The
City is committed to preserving established single-family
neighborhoods by regulating development and encouraging
both property maintenance and rehabilitation. The City has
adopted Ordinance No. 851, commonly known as the anti-
mansionization ordinance, which amended the zoning code to
limit FAR and include design standards to eliminate the looks
of excessive density. The City has also adopted and will
promote guidelines for new development that encourages high
quality site and building design compatibility with surrounding
uses.
Goal 1:          Maintain stable and attractive single-
                 family residential neighborhoods.
Policy 1.1:      Discourage the entitlement and construction of
                 multiple-family units in neighborhoods
                 that are predominately single-family.
Policy 1.2:      Provide guidelines and standards to
                 ensure adequate buffering and screening
                 between lower density residential uses
                 and adjacent higher density residential or
                 non-residential uses to mitigate potential
                 land use conflicts.
Policy 1.3:      Actively promote the maintenance of properties
                 and buildings through code enforcement.
Policy 1.4:      Through the Conditional Use Permit process,
                 Design Review process, residential design
                 guidelines, or zoning enforcement, regulate new
                 and large residential structures that compromise
                 neighborhood quality.
Policy 1.5:      Require that new single-family residential
                 construction, additions, and renovations be
                 designed to protect the privacy of adjacent
                 residential properties and the quality of
                 established neighborhoods.

Policy 1.6:      Where the housing stock and neighborhood
                 design are of high quality, maintain and provide
                 the foundation for strong neighborhood
                 interaction, and ensure that the bulk and mass
                 of new single-family residential buildings or
                 additions be of the same scale as surrounding
                 units      within       established    residential
                 neighborhoods.
Policy 1.7:      Foster housing stock and            neighborhood
                 revitalization,     renovation,     and      good
                 site/architectural design.
Policy 1.8:      Require that new single-family units utilize
                 detailed architectural articulations to promote
                 the visual character of neighborhoods and
                 comply with the adopted single family design
                 guidelines.
Commercial and Industrial Districts
Commercial and industrial districts in Rosemead and the jobs
and tax revenues they provide contribute significantly to the
City’s financial well-being. Economically viable commercial
and industrial businesses generate tax revenue, provide a
variety of shopping and commercial activities, and ensure the
long-term fiscal health of the City. Preserving, retaining, and
building the City’s sales tax base through diverse and successful
commercial and industrial uses allow Rosemead to continue to
provide high level of public services, and to construct public
improvements that enhance the community.
The Land Use Element and Plan will maintain,
enhance, and invigorate commercial development
by:
       Concentrating commercial and industrial
        businesses in established commercial,
        office, and industrial districts;
       Minimizing the “commercial sprawl” of
        strip commercial development; and
       Enhancing        high    quality    commercial              Commercial development
        building and site design while allowing for
        increased intensities of use.
With regard to industrial uses, limited areas in Rosemead are
designated for such businesses, and the City’s focus is on
                                                                                       P A G E 2 - 1 9

retaining and attracting clean industrial uses that have minimal
impact on surrounding residential neighborhoods, that provide
quality jobs, and that contribute to the tax base.
Goal 2:          Expanded opportunities for concentrated
                 commercial and industrial uses that
                 contribute jobs and tax revenues to the
                 community
Policy 2.1:      Establish a well-balanced and carefully planned
                 collection of signature retail anchors, general
                 retail outlets, casual to upscale restaurants, and
                 upscale overnight accommodations which can
                 take advantage of the High Intensity
                 Commercial designated sites’ accessibility to
                 major roadway corridors.
Policy 2.2:      Revitalize commercial strip corridors by creating
                 attractive and dynamic pedestrian-friendly
                 activity nodes and commercial centers.
Policy 2.3:      Encourage continued development of self
                 sustaining commercial uses within centers
                 located at strategic intersections.
Policy 2.4:      Discourage        further     strip     commercial
                 development along major arterials.
Policy 2.5:      Discourage the rezoning of commercial and
                 industrial districts to residential uses.
Policy 2.6:      Rigorously enforce property maintenance
                 standards for commercial and industrial
                 properties.
Policy 2.7:      Establish and apply architectural design review
                 to additions, remodel of existing buildings and
                 new commercial and industrial development.
Policy 2.8:      Encourage the reconfiguration and development
                 of neighborhood shopping centers by offering
                 modified development standards, more intense
                 floor-area ratios, and other tools.
Mixed-Use
The City of Rosemead encourages mixed uses at key locations
as discussed on pages 2-15 to 2-16 and shown on Figure 2-1.

and enhanced commercial business districts.              Enhanced
features should include a livelier streetscape, pedestrian-
friendly street frontages for new buildings, revitalization of
building façades, creation of active and attractive public spaces,
street furniture, and other improvements.
A key opportunity exists to revitalize commercial corridors with
mixed-use developments that provide both needed housing and
commercial retail services. Mixed-use development has several
tangible benefits, most importantly:
       attracting private investment that can help revitalize
        older commercial uses;
       increasing patronage within the area, which translates
        to economic benefits to businesses and the community;
       bringing residential and commercial uses within
        walking distance to each other; and
       promoting pedestrian-friendly mixed-use projects with
        public spaces and lively street fronts where people can
        meet and interact.
For residential and commercial mixed-use projects, tax-
generating restaurants, retail uses, and services are required on
the ground floor street frontages to create a lively street front.
Mixed-use projects often revitalize older commercial districts,
but it is important that the design of new mixed-use
developments reflect the established character of Rosemead.
New mixed-use buildings should be compatible with the scale
and massing of adjacent buildings and respect a site's context
within the overall community. The City has adopted design
guidelines for mixed-use development that provide design
criteria to assist developers and City staff on the review of such
projects, and to ensure that development is of high quality and
reflective of Rosemead’s goals.

                 Rosemead’s central business district.
Policy 3.3:      Provide adequate buffering between existing
                 residential and commercial or light industrial
                 uses within designated Mixed-Use areas, as well
                 as in adjacent areas.
Policy 3.4:      Encourage pedestrian friendly commercial and
                 residential planned developments wherever
                 possible.
Policy 3.5:      Promote lively and attractive ground-floor retail
                 uses that will create public revenues needed to
                 provide for City services and the City’s tax base.
Economic Development and
Revitalization
Creating business and employment opportunities will
strengthen the City’s economic health and provide funds
necessary to provide desired public facilities and services.
Spending money locally increases the success of local
businesses and employers, and improves private investment in
the community. Proactive economic development strategies will
facilitate and encourage the revitalization of the City’s
commercial and industrial corridors. Economic development
activities include facilitating mixed-use development along
commercial corridors to increase the quality of commercial
offerings for residents, retaining important industrial districts,
and focusing regional commercial activity at key locations that
are easily accessible.

                 Temple City Boulevard.
Zoning and Land Use
Policy
The City’s zoning ordinance serves as the primary tool to
implement General Plan land use policies. Under California
law, the zoning ordinance must be consistent with the General
Plan, meaning that each land use category must have one or
more corresponding zone districts, and development standards
and land use regulations in the zoning ordinance must reflect
the policies in the General Plan. While General Plan discussion
of permitted land uses and development intensities is by nature
somewhat general, the zoning ordinance provides the
specificity property owners and developers seek in identifying
how particular properties can be used and developed. Table 2-
5 identifies the relationships between land use categories and
zone districts in Rosemead. The Zoning Ordinance will be
amended to include the mixed-use land use categories.

Development Capacity
Table 2-6 identifies the planned distribution of land uses
resulting from implementation of the Land Use Plan. Over
time, as properties transition from one use to another or
property owners rebuild, land uses and intensities will
gradually shift to align with the intent of this Land Use
Element. Table 2-6 summarizes the land use distribution,
typical level of development anticipated, and the resultant
residential and nonresidential levels of development that can be
expected from full implementation of land use policies
established by this General Plan. Given the almost built-out
character of Rosemead, significant redevelopment activities
may not occur over the life of this General Plan. Average
development densities and potential presented in Table 2-3
reflect primarily established densities, with limited
opportunities for recycling to more intensified development. As
shown in the Table 2-5, the estimated population for Rosemead
is approximately 61,480 in approximately 15,924 housing units.

 Implementation
 Actions
 The following actions will implement Land Use Element
 policies and provide guidance to City decision makers, staff,
 and the public. Each action relates directly to one or more
 policies.
 Goal 1:          Stable       and      attractive         single-family
                  residential neighborhoods.
 Action 1.1       Revise the Zoning Map and zoning ordinance to
                  provide consistency between the map and the
                  General Plan.
 Action 1.2       Enhance code enforcement program to require
                  property owners to maintain their homes and
                  property.
 Action 1.3       Use zoning regulations, and design guidelines,
                  and design review to require new residential
                  development         use      detailed      architectural
                  articulations and to provide adequate buffering

                                                                         L A N D   U S E
           between lower density residential uses and non-
           residential uses.
Action 1.4 Conduct a housing and neighborhood survey to
           determine those areas that:
              Are strong and should be maintained as they
               exist today. Typically in these areas the
               housing is well maintained and has good
               architectural design and site design; the
               neighborhood has sidewalks, landscaping,
               and is pedestrian friendly and safe. These
               neighborhoods should be maintained
               through continued code enforcement; new
               development should be designed to respect
               existing setbacks, neighborhood character,
               architectural style and materials, etc.
              Are encouraged to revitalize through the
               introduction of new or renovated housing
               stock that is designed to promote a higher
               quality of architectural and site design. This
               may include improving housing materials,
               architectural design, site orientation, parking
               and garage location, setbacks, landscape
               requirements, etc.
Action 1.5 Develop a series of design guidelines and
           standards to facilitate strong housing and
           neighborhood maintenance for the appropriate
           neighborhoods as determined by Action 1.4.
Action 1.6 Develop housing and neighborhood design
           guidelines and standards for those areas (as
           determined by Action 1.4) that should be
           encouraged to be revitalized, renovated, and
           remodeled. In addition, establish new design
           guidelines that restrict mansionization.
Action 1.7 Consult with the AQMD when siting new
           facilities with dust, odor emissions to avoid
           siting those facilities near sensitive receptors
           and avoiding siting sensitive receptors near
           sours of air pollution.
Goal 2:    Expanded opportunity for concentrated
           commercial and industrial uses that
           contribute jobs and tax revenues to the
           community
                                                                         P A G E 2 - 2 9

Action 2.1      Prepare a specific plan, development standards,
                and/or design guidelines to plan for future
                development and for both private and public
                realm design features in the High Intensity
                Commercial areas.
Action 2.2      Create incentive programs to encourage the
                renovation and rehabilitation of older
                commercial areas.
Action 2.3      Prepare a specific plan, design guidelines,
                and/or development standards to plan for
                existing development’s revitalziation and for
                future development and to plan for both private
                and public realm design features in the Mixed-
                Use area located on Valley Boulevard between
                Walnut Grove and Rosemead Boulevard.
Action 2.4      Implement the Rosemead Downtown Vision
                Plan or other urban design plans, if adopted by
                the City Council, for new projects and the
                rehabilitation and revitalization of existing
                development on Valley Boulevard.
Action 2.5      Prepare development standards encouraging the
                inclusion of public plazas and spaces in new and
                existing commercial areas.
Action 2.6      Develop a marketing program that identifies
                needed commercial goods and services; actively
                pursue such businesses to locate within existing
                commercial and new mixed-use areas.
Goal 3          Creation of vibrant, attractive mixed-use
                development
Action 3.1      Encourage, whenever appropriate, land use
                conversion     from     marginal       commercial,
                industrial or residential uses to mixed-use
                development along major arterials in areas of
                the     City    designated      for     Mixed-Use
                Residential/Commercial.        Mixed-use
                development of this type should be encouraged
                when a proposal will result in the following:
                   The assembling of existing lots;
                   A reduction of the number of access points
                    or “curb cuts” along an arterial;
                   No negative impact on surrounding land
                    uses.

           Criteria for evaluating a proposal within these
           guidelines could include:
              Conformance to Residential/Commercial
               Mixed-Use development standards and
               adopted Mixed-Use Design Guidelines.
Action 3.2 Require an integrally-colored decorative six foot
           tall CMU block wall, landscaped buffers with
           mature landscaping, and/or a vine-covered wall,
           on those sides abutting a residentially zoned
           area. Agreements between property owners
           should be encouraged whereby the applicant
           installs the wall and/or landscaping and the
           adjacent property owner maintains it because
           the wall is on their property. The landscaped
           buffer strip will have a minimum width of three
           feet between the property line wall and adjacent
           property.
Action 3.3 Encourage land use conversions to commercial
           uses, particularly along major arterials, only
           when a proposal:
              Assembles contiguous lots;
              Limits the number of curb cuts along major
               arterials;
              Provides adequate on-site parking and on-
               site circulation;
              Operates in conformance with the City’s
               Noise Ordinance and other applicable
               environmental regulations; and
              Will not negatively impact surrounding land
               uses.
Action 3.4 Whenever and wherever possible, encourage the
           grouping of certain types of commercial
           activities that would benefit from this type of a
           development.
Action 3.5 To maximize commercial synergy and to
           minimize the development of small, stand alone
           commercial buildings, such as mini-malls, direct
           new commercial development smaller than
           5,000 square feet of gross floor area to shopping
           centers with a combined floor area of at least
           15,000 square feet. This implementation action
           shall not preclude the development of or
                                                                        P A G E 2 - 3 1

Action 3.6      Require owners to maintain their property
                according to current codes and ordinances.
Action 3.7      Apply design standards for industrial and
                commercial uses Citywide.
Action 3.8      During the site development review process,
                require attractive and revenue generating
                ground-floor retail uses for all mixed-use
                projects.
Goal 4:         A financially healthy City that can meet
                residents’ desires for public services and
                facilities
Action 4.1      Inventory structures and parcels in industrial
                areas available for redevelopment, and
                incorporate this information into a guide or
                book to be distributed to industrial real estate
                brokers and developers.
Action 4.2      The City will restrict industrial activities that
                may result in significant and detrimental
                environmental impacts to the City and its
                residents. The significance will be determined
                through the preparation of a CEQA Initial Study
                (IS) and any subsequent environmental analysis.
Goal 5:         Targeted land use changes that improve
                housing and economic opportunities for
                residents and businesses and achieve City
                fiscal and environmental objectives.
Action 5.1      Develop design standards for the Rosemead
                Square site that enhance freeway visibility and
                access.
Action 5.2      Underground utilities in commercial areas and
                require developers to contribute.
Action 5.3      Promote art in public places and require
                developers to contribute.
Action 5.4      Ensure that new developments incorporate both
                local and regional transit measures into project
                design that promote the use of alternative modes

            dedicate land for the provision of on-site bicycle
            trails linking the facility to designated bicycle
            commuting routes.
Action 5.5  Ensure that new developments construct
            buildings that exceed minimum statewide
            energy construction requirements beyond Title
            24 energy requirements.
Action 5.6  In new residential developments, promote
            and/or provide incentives for the use of Energy-
            Star rated appliances.
Action 5.7  Promote the use of shade producing trees,
            particularly those that shade paved surfaces
            such as streets and parking lots and buildings.
            These strategies will minimize the heat island
            effect and thereby reduce the amount of air
            conditioning required.
Action 5.8  Encourage new development to employ passive
            heating and cooling design strategies to the
            extent feasible. Strategies to be considered
            include     orientation;    natural   ventilation,
            including cross-ventilation in residential units;
            high insulation values, energy efficient windows
            including: high performance glass; light-colored
            or high-albedo (reflective) roofing and exterior
            walls; window shading; and landscaping that
            provides shading during appropriate seasons.
Action 5.9  Encourage new developments to implement U.S.
            EPA Certified WaterSense labeled or equivalent
            faucets and high-efficiency toilets (HETs) in
            residential uses, and implement water
            conserving shower heads to the extent feasible.
Action 5.10 Consider targeting local funds, including
            redevelopment, Community Development Block
            Grant, and HOME Investment Partnerships
            funds, to assist affordable housing developers in
            incorporating energy efficient designs and
            features.
Action 5.11 Strengthen local building codes for new
            construction and renovation to require a higher
            level of energy efficiency.
                                                                         P A G E 2 - 3 3

Action 5.12     Encourage all new government buildings, and all
                major renovations and additions, meet identified
                green building standards.
Action 5.13     Consider adopting a “Green Building Program”
                requiring or encouraging green building
                practices and materials. The program could be
                implemented through, e.g., a set of green
                building ordinances.
Action 5.14     Encourage the orientation of buildings to
                maximize passive solar heating during cool
                seasons, avoid solar heat gain during hot
                periods, enhance natural ventilation, and
                promote effective use of daylight. Orientation
                should optimize opportunities for on-site solar
                generation.
Action 5.15     Consider to provide permitting-related and
                other incentives for energy efficient building
                projects, e.g., by giving green projects priority in
                plan review, processing and field inspection
                services.
Action 5.16     Consider adopting a “heat island” mitigation
                plan that requires cool roofs, cool pavements,
                and strategically placed shade trees.
Action 5.17     Consider        expanding      building      permit
                enforcement to include re-roofing thereby
                ensuring compliance with existing state building
                requirements for cool roofs on non-residential
                buildings.
Action 5.18     Strengthen local building codes for new
                construction and implement a program to
                renovate existing buildings to require a higher
                level of water efficiency.
Action 5.19     Consider adopting energy and water efficiency
                retrofit ordinances that require upgrades as a
                condition of issuing permits for renovations or
                additions, and on the sale of residences and
                buildings.
Action 5.20     Discourage projects that impede bicycle and
                walking access, e.g., large parking areas that
                cannot be crossed by non-motorized vehicles,
                and new residential communities that block
                through access on existing or potential bicycle
                and pedestrian routes.

T            he Circulation Element addresses anticipated
             mobility needs, and the ability of the roadway
             network and the various transportation modes to
meet future travel demands through the buildout year of the
Land Use Element (2025).             Incremental increases in
development intensity increase the use of local and regional
roadways by passenger vehicles and trucks. The plan and
policies presented in this Element identify strategies that the
City will pursue to maintain good service levels wherever
possible.
As local roadway facilities are linked to regional roadways, the
policies within this Element highlight Rosemead’s continued
need to work within the region and with neighboring
jurisdictions to alleviate traffic congestion.          Reduced
dependency on the automobile for typical trips supports these
objectives and improves overall environmental quality in terms
of noise and air quality. As there are alternatives to the
passenger vehicle, this Element examines the transportation
options available to Rosemead residents and establishes
appropriate policies to promote diverse trip modes.
California State law requires that each city undertake a periodic
review of its General Plan. The law also requires an update of
the Circulation Element as part of the overall process. The
                                                                                 P A G E 3 - 1

specific code sections and the related requirements are as
follows:
        Government Code Section 65302 (b): (The general plan
         shall include) a circulation element consisting of the
         general location and extent of existing and proposed
         major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals,
         and other local public utilities and facilities, all
         correlated with the land use element of the plan.
        Government Code Section 95303: The general plan may
         address any other subjects, which, in the judgment of
         the legislative body, relate to the physical development
         of the county or city.
Relationship to Other
Elements
According to California planning law, the Circulation Element
must be independent but consistent with other elements. The
Circulation Element is most closely related to the Land Use
Element, as changes in trip patterns and increases in local trip
generation are caused by increases in land use intensity over
time.
The planned development areas identified in the Land Use
Element served as the basis for the analysis of future traffic
levels, and then needed roadway improvements were identified.
Implementation of the Circulation Element ensures that
existing transportation facilities will be improved to adequately
serve traffic generated by future development, where the
improvements are both warranted and feasible. Additionally,
projected noise contours from transportation sources are
included in the Noise Element.
Other Plans
Regional Transportation Plan
The Regional Transportation Plan is a component of the
Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide prepared by the
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) to

with active participation from local agencies throughout the
region, elected officials, the business community, community
groups, private institutions, and private citizens. The Plan sets
broad goals for the region and provides strategies to reduce
problems related to congestion and mobility.
Congestion Management Plan
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(LACMTA or officially known as “Metro”) is responsible for
planning and operating regional transit facilities and services in
Los Angeles County. As required by State law, Metro prepares
a Congestion Management Plan (CMP) for Los Angeles County.
The CMP identifies the future regional transportation network,
establishes acceptable service levels for network routes, and
identifies strategies to reduce congestion. Local jurisdictions
within the County are responsible for implementing the CMP.
The CMP roadway network includes the following roadways
that serve Rosemead:
       San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10)
       Pomona Freeway (State Route 60)
       Rosemead Boulevard (State Route 19)
In addition, the intersection of Rosemead Boulevard at Valley
Boulevard is classified as a CMP arterial monitoring station.
The performance of this intersection is regularly tracked for
CMP report updates.
Air Quality Management Plan
The federal Clean Air Act requires preparation of plans to
improve air quality in any region designated as a non-
attainment area (A non-attainment area is a geographic area
identified by the Environmental Protection Agency and/or
California Air Resources Board as not meeting State or federal
standards for a given pollutant). The plan must outline specific
programs, strategies, and timelines for bringing the area into
compliance with air quality standards. The Air Quality
Management Plan prepared by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District, first adopted in 1994 and updated on a
three-year cycle, contains policies and measures designed to
achieve federal and State standards for healthier air quality in
the South Coast Air Basin. Many of the programs address
circulation improvements, since fossil-fuel-powered vehicles
account for more than 60 percent of the nitrogen oxide
emissions and 70 percent of the carbon monoxide emissions
within the Basin.

Roadway Classifications
Roadways within Rosemead, as in any typical urbanized area,
are defined using a hierarchical classification system. Each
type of roadway is generally described by purpose and capacity.
Rosemead’s circulation system is defined by five types of
roadway facilities, for which the general standards are
described below.
Freeways
Freeways are controlled access, high-speed roadways with
grade-separated interchanges. They are intended to carry high
volumes of traffic from region to region. The planning, design,
construction, and maintenance of freeways in California are the
responsibility of the California Department of Transportation
(Caltrans).
Interstate 10 – The San Bernardino Freeway is a six-lane
freeway with high-occupancy vehicle lanes in both directions.
The facility bisects the commercial/retail areas of the city.
Interstate 10 provides a full-access interchange with Interstate
710 (Long Beach Freeway) approximately four miles to the
west, and also with Interstate 605 (San Gabriel River Freeway)
approximately four miles to the east. Via Interstate 10, direct
access is provided to Los Angeles on the west and San
Bernardino County on the east.
State Route 60 – The Pomona Freeway traverses the southern
end of Rosemead, with an interchange at San Gabriel
Boulevard. The facility generally parallels the San Bernardino
Freeway and has nearby interchanges with the Interstate 710
and Interstate 605 freeways.
Major Arterials
The function of a Major Arterial is to connect traffic from minor
arterials and collectors to other parts of the city, freeway
interchanges, and adjacent major land uses. They are the
principal urban thoroughfares and provide a linkage between
activity centers in the City and to adjacent communities. Major
Arterials are designed to move large volumes of traffic, typically
in the range of 40,000 to 60,000 vehicles per day. They are
generally served by regional transit routes and are the primary
truck routes in the community.
There are currently four Major Arterials within the City of
Rosemead: Valley Boulevard, Garvey Avenue, San Gabriel
Boulevard, and Rosemead Boulevard.

Minor Arterials
The primary purpose of Minor Arterials is to serve as an
intermediate route carrying traffic between local streets and
major arterials. They are designed to carry moderate levels of
traffic, generally in the range of 15,000 to 25,000 vehicles per
day.      Within Rosemead, these roadway facilities were
previously referred to as Secondary Arterials. The roadway
plan within this Element introduces the Minor Arterial
designation, as it is a more descriptive name for the function of
these facilities.
Minor Arterials within the City include Del Mar Avenue, Graves
Avenue, New Avenue, Rush Street, Temple City Boulevard,
Lower Azusa Road, Mission Drive, and Walnut Grove Avenue.
These well-placed streets complete the well-balanced arterial
circulation system, which the City has constructed to provide
an efficient flow of traffic to places of importance while
protecting residential neighborhoods.
Collector Roads
The primary function of a collector street is to connect a
neighborhood area with nearby arterials. Collector roads are
intended to move traffic between local streets and arterials and
commonly carry less than 15,000 vehicles per day.
Roadways classified as collector streets include Encinita
Avenue, Grand Avenue, Hellman Avenue, Ivar Avenue, Loftus
Drive, Marshall Street, Muscatel Avenue, Ramona Boulevard,
Rio Hondo Avenue, and Rosemead Place.
Local Streets
Local streets are designed to principally provide vehicular,
pedestrian, and bicycle access to individual parcels throughout
the City. They are intended to carry low volumes of traffic, and
are typically two-lane roadways.
The established hierarchy of roadway            facilities within
Rosemead is illustrated within Figure 3-1.

Measurement of Traffic Flow
The traffic study for this element was primarily based on two
traffic engineering concepts – Intersection Capacity Utilization
(ICU) values and Level of Service (LOS) values. Both of these
are used to measure the adequacy of roadway facilities, but the
ICU methodology was specifically developed to gauge the
operations at signalized roadway intersections. The ICU
methodology is based on specific calculations that include the
number of approach lanes and approach volumes by turning
movement.
The ICU output value correlates directly with a more common
term in traffic engineering, the volume to capacity (V/C) ratio.
Traffic volumes for existing conditions at the analyzed locations
are defined by traffic counts, conducted manually at roadway
intersections or by automatic tube counters at mid-block
roadway segments. Traffic volumes for future or forecast
conditions are defined by annual increases in ambient/area
traffic and specific traffic increases calculated for planned land
use intensity/use changes under the Land Use Element.
Capacity refers to the maximum vehicle carrying ability of a
roadway, and is a critical component of roadway design. A
roadway that carries 16,000 vehicles per day, with the capacity
to accommodate 20,000 vehicles within the same timeframe,
has a V/C value of 0.80 for the analyzed time period.
The V/C value is used in turn to establish Level of Service
(LOS) categories describing the performance of roadways and
intersections throughout the community. Six categories of LOS
– the letter designations A to F – are used to identify traffic
conditions, with LOS A representing excellent conditions and
LOS F representing extreme congestion. For roadways, the
LOS designations are based on V/C ratios calculated based on
the roadway’s capacity at the LOS E/LOS F threshold of 1.00.
Table 3-1 provides V/C ranges, the corresponding LOS, and a
description of expected traffic conditions for roadway
segments.
For intersections, LOS is based on Intersection Capacity
Utilization (ICU) ratios, which take into account the volume-to-
capacity ratios of all of the critical turning movements that take
place at an intersection. Table 3-2 provides ranges of ICU
values (equivalent to V/C values), the corresponding LOS, and
a description of expected traffic conditions for intersections.

    A     LOS A describes primarily free-flow operations at average travel speeds,      0-0.60
          usually about 90 percent of the free-flow speed for the arterial
          classification. Vehicles are completely unimpeded in their ability to
          maneuver within the traffic stream. Stopped delays at signalized
          intersections are minimal.
    B     LOS B represents reasonably unimpeded operations at average travel           0.61-0.70
          speeds, usually about 70 percent of the free-flow speed for the arterial
          classification. The ability to maneuver within the traffic stream is only
          slightly restricted and stopped delays are not bothersome. Drivers are
          not generally subjected to appreciable tension.
    C     LOS C represents stable operations; however, ability to maneuver and         0.71-0.80
          change lanes in midblock locations may be more restricted than at LOS B,
          and longer queues, adverse signal coordination, or both may contribute
          to lower average speeds of about 50 percent of the average free-flow
          speed for the arterial classification. Motorists will experience appreciable
          tension while driving.
    D     LOS D borders on a range in which small increases in flow may cause a        0.81-0.90
          substantial increase in delay and hence decreases in arterial speed. LOS
          D may be due to adverse signal progression, inappropriate signal timing,
          high volumes, or some combination of these factors. Average travel
          speeds are about 40 percent of free-flow speed.
    E     LOS E is characterized by significant delays and average travel speeds of    0.91-1.00
          one-third the free-flow speed or less. Such operations are caused by
          some combination of adverse progression, high signal density, high
          volumes, extensive delays at critical intersections, and inappropriate
          signal timing.
    F     LOS F characterizes arterial flow at extremely low speeds below one-third    Over 1.00
          to one-fourth of the free-flow speed. Intersection congestion is likely at
          critical signalized locations, with high delays and extensive queuing.
          Adverse progression is frequently a contributor to this condition.

     A        Excellent operation. All approaches to the intersection appear             0-0.60
              quite open, turning movements are easily made, and nearly all
              drivers find freedom of operation.
     B        Very good operation. Many drivers begin to feel somewhat                  0.61-0.70
              restricted within platoons of vehicles. This represents stable
              flow. An approach to an intersection may occasionally be fully
              utilized and traffic queues start to form.
     C        Good operation. Occasionally drivers may have to wait more                0.71-0.80
              than 60 seconds, and back-ups may develop behind turning
              vehicles. Most drivers feel somewhat restricted.
     D        Fair operation. Cars are sometimes required to wait more than             0.81-0.90
              60 seconds during short peaks. There are no long-standing
              traffic queues. This level is typically associated with design
              practice for peak periods.
     E        Poor operation. Some long-standing vehicular queues develop               0.91-1.00
              on critical approaches to intersections. Delays may be up to
              several minutes.
     F        Forced flow. Represents jammed conditions. Backups form                   Over 1.00
              locations downstream or on the cross street may restrict or
              prevent movement of vehicles out of the intersection approach
              lanes; therefore, volumes carried are not predictable. Potential
              for stop and go type traffic flow.

Future Circulation
Issues
The local circulation system within Rosemead has evolved over
time to provide travel routes for both local and regional trips.
Major roadways provide access to the I-10 freeway and the
State Route (SR) 60 freeway. The I-10 and SR-60 freeways are
both east-west trending facilities within the city that have
access ramps at major north-south roadways. These freeways
link Rosemead residents and businesses to destinations
throughout the Los Angeles area and the Southern California
region.
Rosemead Boulevard, Walnut Grove Avenue, San Gabriel
Boulevard, and Del Mar Avenue are the major north-south
roadways within the City. All four major north-south roads
provide connections to Interstate 10. In addition, San Gabriel
Boulevard connects to SR-60 within the southern area of the
city. Valley Boulevard, Garvey Avenue, Graves Avenue, and
Rush Street are the major east-west roadways within the City.
Although these arterials often act as relief valves to the
freeways during peak commute periods, they also provide good
alternative travel routes to destinations throughout the San
Gabriel Valley.
A safe and convenient circulation system is needed to support
the variety of land uses in Rosemead and to manage through
traffic that originates in and is destined for locations outside
the City.
Four major issues are addressed by the goals, policies, and
implementation actions of the Circulation Element:
    (1) Efficient movement       of  vehicles   and  pedestrians
         throughout the city;
    (2) Promoting alternative modes of travel;
    (3) Separating traffic associated with commercial and
         industrial uses from residential neighborhoods; and
    (4) Ensuring that adequate parking exists            for  all
         commercial and industrial development.

Future Land Use Intensification
Development outside of the City limits will generate additional
increases in area traffic volumes. Such development has been
incorporated into the ambient annual growth rate within the
Circulation Element traffic analysis, added to existing volumes
and compounded over the period between existing (year 2009)
and future buildout (year 2025) conditions. Traffic generated
from developments envisioned under the updated Land Use
Element was added to the analysis after the creation of future
ambient growth volumes.
Relationship of Trip Generation to Land
Use Makeup
All development creates vehicle trips of some measurable total
per unit of intensity (floor area increment or residential unit).
The trip generation methodology used within the traffic study,
and the assumptions utilized for trip reductions, are discussed
below. The potential for increased use of transit, bicycles, or
other trip modes was not included in the analysis in order to
provide a conservative estimate of impacts.
Conservative Nature of Development Analysis
The trip generation totals used within the traffic analysis
prepared for the Circulation Element update were conservative,
both by design and by necessity.           The traffic analysis
methodology was designed to plan for a conservative level of
trip generation from each area of intensified development that
would be allowed under the updated Land Use Element. It is
also necessary to provide this conservative analysis, as
additional trip generation reductions, beyond those taken for
7mixed-use developments (discussed below) cannot be
substantiated without intense transit service levels or
established and active trip reduction programs.
With increasing land use densities that commonly occur during
the maturation of an urban-area city, there is an increasing
potential for higher transit use or an increasing potential for
higher percentage shares of walking trips and bicycle trips.
Infrastructure and programs must support these changes in
trip patterns, however.
As Rosemead is entering a new phase of urbanization through
establishment of major mixed-use centers within the updated
Land Use Element and the current predominant makeup of the
City is lower density, single-use developments, credits were
only taken for internal trip capture between uses within mixed-
                                                                            P A G E 3 - 1 1

use projects and for pass-by or linked trips. These deductions,
typical to traffic studies, are based on national standards for
related trip reductions and characteristics.
Pass-by reductions were taken for commercial retail trips
during the p.m. peak hour only. These reductions were based
on typical percentages of these occurrences (unplanned side
trips that take place between a planned or regular daily origin
and destination). These primary trips already exist on the area
roadways, and the pass-by trips would become an additional
linked trip along the route of the overall primary trip, so these
are not included in the impact calculations.
Additional reductions were taken for internal trip capture
within mixed-use developments. There are multiple mixed-use
project zones envisioned within the updated Land Use Element.
These mixed-use developments – most typically consisting of
retail and residential uses in one building – capture some
residential-to-commercial trip demand internally and such
trips are therefore not generated on area roadways.
Further trip reductions were not taken. A methodology that
established trip reduction estimates for developments along
transit corridors are provided within the CMP document.
However, existing transit levels within Rosemead, and transit
levels envisioned for the near future, would not support the use
of these additional trip reductions in the analysis.
Potential Trip Generation Intensity Reductions
The synergy that is possible between multiple mixed-use and
higher-density development projects has not been factored into
the trip generation calculations. When this synergy occurs,
more walking trips occur between different nearby
developments and more non-auto trips can be generated.
These aspects, however, are difficult to estimate at the level of
analysis undertaken for the city-wide traffic study conducted
for this Element. In addition, estimates for such reductions can
only be defined through surveys at similar uses which were not
conducted for this macro-level analysis. As trip reductions for
these types of trips were not taken, the analysis provides a
conservative (or worst-case) estimate of potential traffic
impacts.
Traffic Circulation Analysis
According to the Circulation Element Update traffic impact
study report, completed by KOA Corporation on February 19,
2010, multiple roadway segments and major intersections
would operate at LOS values of E or F in the year 2025 with

The following degradations in roadway segment daily LOS
values would occur with full implementation of the updated
Land Use Element:
        Walnut Grove Ave., between Valley Blvd. and Marshall
         St. – LOS would worsen from E to F
        Walnut Grove Ave., between Hellman Ave. and Garvey
         Ave. – LOS would worsen from D to E
        Garvey Ave., between New Ave. and Del Mar Ave. -LOS
         would worsen from C to E.
        Garvey Ave., between San Gabriel Blvd. and Walnut
         Grove Ave. -LOS would worsen from D to E.
Figure 3-3 illustrates the levels of service based on the
analyzed daily volumes at the study roadway segments, for the
future with General Plan development scenario.
Traffic Incursion onto Residential
Roadways
In residential neighborhoods, there is a growing trend to design
and implement traffic control measures to enhance the
livability for residents that live along local streets. Some of the
control measures include speed humps, speed cushions, curb
extensions, traffic diverters, chokers, and traffic circles. The
intent of such measures is to slow traffic or prevent through
traffic, which should remain on collector or arterial streets and
not infiltrate residential neighborhoods.
This Element acknowledges the potential for significant traffic
increases on residential roadways due to nearby intensification
of corridor commercial or industrial development.

Circulation Plan
The goals and policies in this Element emphasize the need for a
circulation system capable of serving the travel traffic needs
within Rosemead. These needs are discussed within this
section.
General Plan Roadway System
The updated roadway plan for the city is illustrated on Figure
3-4. The updates to the roadway plan are based on needs for
increased roadway corridor capacity in the future analysis
period with General Plan development, as identified by the
Circulation Element update traffic study.
Roadway improvements, outside of those required as
mitigation for individual development projects, are prioritized,
funded, and completed using the City’s Capital Improvement
Plan process. Many of the recommended mitigations for
significant impacts of the Circulation Element update would
need to be provided by individual developments as they trigger
impacts, or otherwise would need to be funded through the
Capital Improvement Plan or another source.
The Circulation Policy Plan for Rosemead is illustrated in
Figure 3-4.      This Plan includes the following roadway
classification updates, for certain segments of these roadways,
based on the recommended addition of lanes within this
section:
        Walnut Grove Avenue, from the I-10 freeway north to
         Valley Boulevard – Reclassified from Minor Arterial to
         Major Arterial.
For some roadways, an increase in the number of lanes does
not translate to a change in classification (for example, a four-
lane major arterial upgraded to a six-lane major arterial stays at
the same classification).

Addressing Traffic Congestion
Although many of the policies within this Element concentrate
on reducing trips and promoting alternate modes of travel
within Rosemead, the base of any urban circulation system is a
roadway network that provides enough capacity to avoid peak-
period gridlock and allow for economic functions,
resident/visitor and commercial customer access, and
emergency access to continue in as efficient a manner as
possible.
The land area within Rosemead has not been developed within
a vacuum. The city has grown up and urbanized along with the
surrounding communities and the Southern California region
as a whole. Traffic volumes will continue to increase on
Rosemead roadways whether local development is intensified
or not.      Capacity enhancements will be necessary to
accommodate both regional trips that traverse Rosemead and
for trips generated by new development within the city.
Traffic congestion continues to be a key issue affecting the
quality of life in Rosemead.          Although Rosemead will
experience limited growth outside of planned mixed-use project
areas, regional influences will continue to contribute to traffic
congestion. Over time, the City will pursue two primary
courses of action to improve congestion:
     (1) Focused physical improvements that enhance the
         capacity of roadways and intersections; and
     (2) Creative programmatic solutions to manage trip
         generation and congestion.
These two sets of actions are discussed further within the
remainder of this section.
Physical Capacity Improvements
The first set of physical capacity improvements that were
evaluated for the Circulation Element update were aimed at
reducing traffic congestion at major intersection approaches.
Identified capacity improvements at major intersections, for
implementation through the buildout analysis year of 2025, are
listed within Table 3-5 below.

Also included in the analysis was the configuration of mid-
block segments of major roadways. These also represent
capacity increases for the reduction of congestion. The
identified physical improvements to major roadway corridors,
for implementation through the buildout analysis year of 2025,
are listed within Table 3-6 below.

Additional Potential Capacity Improvements
Other general operational improvements were identified for the
study intersections that focus on turn lane configurations.
Improvements can be made at these locations as operational
improvements, but they are not required to mitigate study
intersection impacts. The improvements are based on general
traffic engineering standards. It is general traffic engineering
practice to consider a separate right-turn lane when movement
traffic volumes exceed 200 vehicles in the peak hour, and a
single left-turn lane is considered when traffic volumes exceed
100 vehicles during the peak hour. For dual turn lanes, the
standard is to consider additional turn lanes when the
movement traffic volumes exceed 300 vehicles in either peak
hour.
Based on these additional potential improvements, widening
would likely occur at most intersections. Land dedications
should be considered to implement these measures as new
adjacent development occurs.
Table 3-7 provides a summary of additional potential capacity
improvements based on the turn volumes at the study
intersections.
Alternative Capacity Enhancements
An alternate strategy for traffic improvement is the
implementation of corridor traffic signal synchronization with
adaptive control technology.          Adaptive signal control
technologies have the goals of reducing travel times, vehicle
delay, and overall congestion. According to studies conducted
by the City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation
(LADOT), increases in roadway capacity by as much as ten
percent can be achieved through the implementation of these
signal system technologies. This gain appears in the form of
less congestion, delays, and stops at the included roadway
intersections.

Corridor synchronization improvements, however, can only be
effective in implementation where there are multiple traffic
signals along a corridor that can facilitate movements of
platoons of vehicles while minimizing delay on the major street.
Figure 3-5 provides an illustration of the corridors
recommended for traffic signal coordination and centralized
control within the traffic study for this Element.
The post-improvement operations at the study intersection are
provided within Table 3-8 (a.m. peak) and Table 3-9 (p.m.
peak).     The analyzed improvements include operational
benefits for those intersections within the recommended
synchronization      corridors,      and     approach   capacity
improvements for locations outside of those corridors.
With the implementation of signal synchronization and
adaptive control within the recommended corridors, the
following intersections within the corridors would continue to
have significant impacts and would require traditional
widening improvements:
       Walnut Grove Ave. at Marshall St. – a.m. peak and p.m.
        peak hours
       Walnut Grove Ave. at San Gabriel Blvd. – p.m. peak
        hour
Implementation of a centralized and adaptive traffic signal
control system, while not eliminating the need for physical
capacity increases at all major area intersections, will provide
alternative remedy for traffic impacts of the Land Use Element
update at many local intersections.
Local implementation of such a system in Rosemead can be
implemented as an extension of the Intelligent Transportation
System (ITS) projects currently being planned and
implemented by the County of Los Angeles Department of
Public Works. Rosemead will become part of the San Gabriel
Valley ITS system, and would potentially have the ability (with

Demand and Alternative Mode Enhancements
As an alternative to physical roadway improvements,
Rosemead must begin actively promoting a diversity of trip
modes to and from local developments, the use of transit for a
higher proportion of local and commuter trips, and
encouragement of trip management programs at the individual
development level. Such actions have been included in the list
of implementation goals and policies within this Element.
The potential for the reduction of vehicle trip generation from
commercial developments is described below for each of these
categories:
      Promoting a diversity of trip modes: All potential trip
       modes including passenger vehicles, walking, bicycling,
       and transit must be considered in the evaluation of
       major development projects within Rosemead. As
       major roadway projects are considered in the future, the
       provision of bicycle lanes should be considered where
       additional lanes or on-street parking would normally be
       provided. Provision of these facilities must be balanced,
       however, with the management of congestion and the
       parking needs of adjacent land uses.
      Promoting higher use of transit: Rosemead is served by
       a basic network of regional transit lines and the local
       shuttle lines operated by the City. A movement of
       transit’s role within Rosemead into a viable mode of
       local and commuter travel must occur. The City should
       develop a centralized transit center that includes a bus
       transfer center that links local routes with commuter
       routes to downtown Los Angeles and other major job
       centers. A park-and-ride facility could also be a part of
       the larger transit center development.             In-lieu
       mitigation measures should be considered for major
       developments, where contributions would be made
       toward the establishment or frequency increase of
       transit service to and from those developments,
       providing support to transit development as new
       development occurs.
      Promoting the use of trip management programs: Trip
       generation can often only be effectively managed at the
       source. Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
       programs have been used for many years in local
       jurisdictions as an avenue to provide in-lieu mitigation
       measures for commercial developments. Resources are
       allocated by the developer to subsidization of transit
       passes, the promotion of carpooling and alternate trip
       modes, and the infusion of transit awareness into the
       workplace. The City should begin requiring TDM
                                                                            P A G E 3 - 3 3
                                                                  A P R I L   1 3 , 2 0 1 0

         programs where physical traffic mitigation measures are
         infeasible or where roadway widening at the associated
         loss of parking or sidewalk areas would be undesirable.
         Post-implementation monitoring of trip reduction
         targets must be tied to development approvals when
         TDM plans are involved.
Trips by bicycle can be encouraged by both on-street and off-
street facilities. On-street facilities would include striped and
signed (Class II) bicycles lanes on cross-town routes that
overlap with major roadways and bicycle loops/sensors at
traffic lights. Off-street facilities can include bicycle racks and
kiosks with bicycle route maps at small public facilities or
private      developments,       up     to    bicycle   enclosures,
showers/lockers, and bicycle rentals at large facilities.
The existing bicycle route network within Rosemead, and the
potential future bicycle network, is illustrated within Figure 3-
6. This potential bicycle lane network is for illustrative
purposes only, but provides an example of how a bicycle
network can be spaced across the city while providing access to
most residential neighborhoods and commercial districts.
Ideally, bicycle lanes would be placed on low-volume roadways
that traverse the City.
The potential routes would need further study, to determine if
parking or travel lanes can be removed or adjusted to provide
for the bicycle facilities, or if future roadway widening and
improvements can include such facilities in the approved cross-
sections. The study would examine whether arterials or
continuous but lower-volume collector roadways would be
appropriate for the provision of bicycle facilities.

Controlling Truck Traffic Through Routes
The existing truck route network within Rosemead provides for
truck access to local businesses, and to some extent, provides
routes for trucks to travel through the City to other
destinations.
Where truck traffic is intruding on areas where walking trips
and other modes are being promoted, it should be prohibited.
Where truck traffic is impeding resident access to
neighborhoods, other roadway facilities, or the freeways, access
routes should be reconsidered.
Truck route locations and the potential adverse traffic impacts
that would result from a consolidation of routes on specific
corridors should be examined in more detail in a special study,
which on completion would serve as an update to the
Circulation Element. Truck route signage should also be
studied and updated as necessary as part of the special study.
Goals and Policies
Based on the issues and potential solutions presented within
this Circulation Element update document, the following goals
and policies were developed to guide implementation of the
identified solutions.
Goal 1:         Maintain       efficient     vehicular      and
                pedestrian movements throughout the
                City.
Policy 1.1:     Annually monitor and review the function of
                Rosemead’s primary roadway system to identify
                any major capacity bottlenecks.
Policy 1.2:     Annually review and update, via special study,
                truck route designations within the City.
Policy 1.3:     Assure that traffic studies for individual
                developments, and traffic studies conducted for
                sectors of the community and specific plans by
                the City, make every effort to provide LOS D
                operations or better on arterial roadways and
                collector roadways if a nexus to the project
                exists.
Policy 1.4:     Preparation of a traffic impact report shall be
                required for major development projects located
                                                                           P A G E 3 - 3 7
                                                                 A P R I L  1 3 , 2 0 1 0

                 in designated mixed-use areas, which generate
                 trips that would meet a predetermined trip
                 threshold.
Policy 1.5:      Encourage the development of Transportation
                 Demand Management (TDM) programs for all
                 major office and commercial developments.
Policy 1.6:      Cooperate with neighboring jurisdictions to craft
                 resolutions to regional traffic problems. Special
                 emphasis should be devoted to Rosemead
                 Boulevard, Valley Boulevard, Garvey Avenue,
                 and San Gabriel Boulevard.
Policy 1.7:      Identify appropriate improvements to the Del
                 Mar Avenue at Garvey Avenue intersection for
                 the relief of congestion, while supporting transit
                 use and walking, as individual area mixed-use
                 developments are reviewed.
Goal 2:          Development of infrastructure and
                 service to support alternatives modes of
                 travel.
Policy 2.1:      To identify areas of traffic spillover as new
                 developments occur, monitor traffic patterns in
                 residential neighborhoods that are adjacent to
                 commercial or industrial corridors.
Policy 2.2:      The provision of Class II (striped and signed)
                 bicycle lanes along minor arterial or collector
                 roadway corridors during roadway re-
                 construction projects should be evaluated and
                 implemented if feasible.
Policy 2.3:      Formal transit improvements should be
                 considered when bus stops are adjacent to
                 development projects and within roadway re-
                 construction corridors.       Amenities such as
                 shelters, lighting, bus schedule kiosks, and
                 similar amenities should be considered and
                 implemented as feasible.
Policy 2.4:      Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
                 programs should be actively promoted for major
                 projects as in-lieu mitigation measures, where
                 physical traffic mitigations are either infeasible
                 or undesirable to the City.

Policy 2.5: All site plans for new commercial or industrial
            development shall be reviewed for the provision
            of pedestrian connectivity to sidewalks and
            nearby bus stops, and the provision of bicycle
            and racks and transit information for larger
            projects.
Policy 2.6: Walkable areas of the city, such as in the
            downtown area or the proposed mixed-use
            districts, should be reviewed for ways to improve
            pedestrian access (driveway access point
            reductions, buffers between roadways and
            sidewalks, crosswalks, etc.).
Policy 2.7: Promote the linking of local public transit routes
            with that of adjacent jurisdictions and other
            transit agencies.
Policy 2.8  Include safe and convenient bicycle and
            pedestrian access in all transportation
            improvement projects. Ensure that non-
            motorized transportation systems are connected
            and not interrupted by impassable barriers, such
            as freeways and include amenities such as secure
            bicycle parking.
Goal 3:     Vehicular        traffic      associated      with
            commercial and industrial uses should
            not intrude upon adjacent residential
            neighborhoods.
Policy 3.1: Develop neighborhood traffic control plans for
            those neighborhoods experiencing spillover
            traffic impacts that may result from
            intensification of commercial or industrial areas.
Policy 3.2: Annually      review     on-street    parking    in
            neighborhoods adjacent to the downtown area
            and mixed-use districts, and develop parking
            and control plans for those areas adversely
            affected by spillover traffic and parking.
Policy 3.3: Require that traffic studies for individual
            developments along commercial corridors
            examine the potential impacts on nearby
            residential roadway segments.              Consider
            residential parking permit programs if necessary
            to mitigate potential area parking impacts.
                                                                          P A G E 3 - 3 9

C I R C U L A T I O N
Policy 3.4:       Develop standards for significant impacts to
                  residential roadways, and include these
                  standards within the adopted traffic study
                  guidelines for the City.
Policy 3.5:       Discourage the use of local residential roadways
                  as through routes. This type of traffic movement
                  shall be discouraged through traffic calming
                  planning that involves the local residents.
Goal 4:           Provide       quality      commercial         and
                  industrial development with adequate
                  parking for employees and visitors.
Policy 4.1:       Private and public parking shall be provided in
                  sufficient amount to adequately meet local needs
                  and to minimize congestion on arterial streets.
Policy 4.2:       Conduct periodic reviews of parking code
                  standards and evaluate the standards for
                  adequacy and applicability to changing
                  development trends within the city.
Policy 4.3:       Require projects in revitalization/redevelopment
                  areas to provide adequate off-street parking,
                  even in re-use projects.
Policy 4.4:       Establish in-lieu parking fees for downtown
                  areas. The City could utilize these fees to build
                  parking lots or structures as needed, or to create
                  a designated parking district.

           component within the City traffic impact study
           guidelines.
Action 1.5 Prohibit truck traffic on local and collector
           streets unless such streets provide the only
           access to a site.
Action 1.6 Conduct a citywide study of truck routes to
           determine if truck routes can be consolidated
           without creating adverse impacts due to
           concentrations of truck traffic.
Action 1.7 Evaluate the appropriateness of identification
           signage on truck routes, including truck route
           turn signs at major intersections.
Action 1.8 Study alternatives for improving circulation in
           the vicinity of Rosemead Square including the
           addition of travel lanes on Rosemead Boulevard
           through prohibition of parking and a possible
           redesign of the adjacent ramp approaches at the
           I-10/Rosemead Boulevard interchange.

                adjacent parallel but minor roadways should be
                considered.
Action 2.3      Develop a Long-Range Transportation Plan for
                transit service within Rosemead, which
                evaluates potential locations for a centralized
                transit center and park-and-ride facility. The
                center should tie in regional local and commuter
                transit lines and the City transit shuttle.
Action 2.4      Require Transportation Demand Management
                (TDM) programs for major projects as in-lieu
                mitigation measures, where physical traffic
                mitigations are either infeasible or undesirable
                to the City.
Action 2.5      Design guidelines and roadway improvement
                policies within the downtown area and the
                planned mixed-use district should promote the
                reduction of driveway access points, the
                provision of buffer space or objects between
                roadways and sidewalks, and provide for safe
                mid-point crosswalks, as needed and as feasible
                within available right-of-way and within existing
                roadway/control configurations.
Action 2.6      Collaborate with local transit agencies to:
                 Develop programs and educate employers
                    about employee rideshare (carpooling) and
                    transit.
                 Establish mass transit mechanisms for the
                    reduction of worker-related and nonwork
                    related vehicle trips.

Action 2.7  Work with AQMD and other agencies to receive
            grants for alternative modes of transportation
            and improved traffic flow.
Action 2.8  In conjunction with measures that encourage
            public transit, ride sharing, bicycling and
            walking, implement circulation improvements
            that reduce vehicle idling. For example,
            coordinate controlled intersections so that traffic
            passes more efficiently through congested areas.
Action 2.9  Create an interconnected transportation system
            that allows a shift in travel from private
            passenger vehicles to alternative modes,
            including public transit, ride sharing, car
            sharing, bicycling and walking. Before funding
            transportation improvements that increase
            vehicle miles traveled, consider alternatives such
            as increasing public transit or improving bicycle
            or pedestrian travel routes.
Action 2.10 Consider giving funding preference to
            investment in public transit over investment in
            infrastructure for private automobile traffic.
Action 2.11 Consider providing public transit incentives,
            including free and reduced fare areas.
Action 2.12 Consider adopting a comprehensive parking
            policy that discourages private vehicle use and
            encourages the use of alternative transportation.
            For example, reduce parking for private vehicles
            while increasing options for alternative
            transportation; eliminate minimum parking
            requirements for new buildings; “unbundle”
            parking (require that parking is paid for
            separately and is not included in rent for
            residential or commercial space); and set
            appropriate pricing for parking.
Goal 3:     Vehicular       traffic      associated       with
            commercial and industrial uses should
            not intrude upon adjacent residential
            neighborhoods.
Action 3.1  Require evaluation of potential parking overflow
            onto adjacent residential roadways for traffic
            and parking studies for new commercial and
            industrial developments.
                                                                          P A G E 3 - 4 3

                for demand generated by commercial and
                industrial activities, using permit programs and
                related signage for affected local streets.
Action 3.3      Periodically review on-street parking in
                neighborhoods                adjacent          to
                revitalization/redevelopment       districts  and
                develop parking and control plans for those
                areas adversely affected by spillover traffic and
                parking.
Goal 4:         Provide       quality       commercial       and
                industrial development with adequate
                parking for employees and visitors.
Action 4.1      Require that any re-use of commercial or
                industrial redevelopment or reuse project must
                demonstrate that adequate on-site parking and
                loading will be provided for the proposed use.
Action 4.2      Examine potential on-street parking demand
                within the immediate vicinity of proposed
                projects as part of the parking analyses
                conducted for projects in the mixed-use and
                downtown districts.

Introduction
S            tate law requires every general plan to have an
             open space element (Section 65302[e]) and a
             conservation element (Section 65302[d]). The
open space and conservation elements complement one
another due to the overlap in State requirements and the
interrelationship of issues within each element. This is
particularly true in Rosemead, which no longer has abundant
open space and undeveloped natural resources. This
circumstance emphasizes the importance of treating with care
the City’s remaining resources and open spaces. For these
reasons, the Open Space and Conservation Elements have been
combined into the Resource Management Element.
The Resources Management Element open space component’s
purpose is to guide and set a policy framework for existing and
future open space uses for use by residents. The conservation
component focuses on protecting and maintaining available
natural resources and discouraging wasteful consumption
practices. The conservation components include greenspace,
water resources, air quality, and mineral resources.
                                                                                P A G E    4 - 1

R E S O U R C E      M A N A G E M E N T
Important Regional Plans
Natural resources such as water and air represent regional
resources that are not contained within political jurisdictional
boundaries. Thus, regional agencies have established regional
programs and approaches to protect and conserve resources
shared by many cities and large geographic areas.
Air Quality Management Plan
The federal Clean Air Act requires preparation of plans to
improve air quality in any region designated as a non-
attainment area. (A non-attainment area is a geographic area
identified by the Environmental Protection Agency and/or
California Air Resources Board as not meeting State or federal
standards for a given pollutant.) The plan must outline specific
programs, strategies, and timelines for bringing the area into
compliance with air quality standards. The Air Quality
Management Plan prepared by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District, first adopted in 1994 and updated on a
three-year cycle, contains policies and measures designed to
achieve federal and State standards for healthier air quality in
the South Coast Air Basin. Many of the programs address
circulation improvements, since fossil-fuel-powered vehicles
account for more than 60 percent of the nitrogen oxide
emissions and 70 percent of the carbon monoxide emissions
within the Basin. Businesses in Rosemead are required to
comply with regulations of the South Coast Air Quality
Management District, the agency charged with the
authority to improve air quality in the region.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES)
As part of a comprehensive effort to improve the quality
of the nation’s water resources, the federal government
authorizes the State Regional Water Quality Control
Board, Los Angeles Region to set up programs to
implement National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) goals. Under the NPDES Stormwater
Permit issued to the County of Los Angeles and
Rosemead as co-permittees, most new development
projects in the City are required to incorporate measures
that minimize pollutant levels within stormwater runoff.
Compliance is required at the time construction permits
are issued, as well as over the long term through periodic
inspections. The Water Resources and Quality section of
this Element discusses the NPDES program.

Relationship to Other Elements
The Resource Management Element works in concert with the
Land Use Element to promote City goals. The Land Use
Element designates areas for open space and recreation.
Parks, Open Space,
Greenbelt, and Public
Art Issues, Goal, and
Policies
Parks and Open Space
As a largely built-out community, Rosemead recognizes the
critical importance of enhancing and protecting resources for
residents’ physical health and the businesses’ economic health.
Thus, these goals and policies emphasize: (1) preserving and
maintaining established open space and recreational resources;
(2) making provisions for additional open space; (3) assisting in
the conservation and protection of water resources; and (4)
contributing to regional efforts to improve air quality and
energy conservation.
Parks
One of the issues facing Rosemead is the availability of open
space and parkland to residents for passive and active
recreation. The Resource Management Element serves as a
plan for parkland and recreational open space in Rosemead.
Parks serve a variety of needs; a classification is appropriate to
understand the function of individual parks. In addition to
providing a classification for parklands within the City, this
Element provides standards that will be applied to the
development of new parks. Standards are important to clearly
defining the function, characteristics, and facilities associated
with a particular type of park. These same standards should
also be flexible to allow for variability in parks that is
characteristic of most communities. The following park
standards are specific to the City of Rosemead and apply to
both existing and future parkland.
                                                                                  P A G E   4 - 3

R E S O U R C E       M A N A G E M E N T
Regional Park
This category includes parks that are generally operated by
large cities, a county, or a park district. Regional parks typically
exceed 200 acres and have a variety of facilities for a wide
range of interests. The Whittier Narrows Recreation Area,
located adjacent to the eastern City border and one mile south
of Rosemead, is an example of this type of park. This park has
in excess of 1,000 acres and will continue to provide Rosemead
residents and the surrounding region numerous recreational
opportunities. The park offers fishing, skeet, pistol and trap
shooting ranges, picnicking areas, a nature center, an
equestrian facility, trails, numerous types of play fields and
courts, playgrounds, and an extensive trail network.
Community Park
A community park is broadly defined as a park that is over 10
acres in area and, because of the nature of facilities provided,
serves between 10,000 and 30,000 residents. A community
park’s service area is from one-half to one mile. Garvey Park
and Rosemead Park are in this park category.
                             Garvey Park
Neighborhood Park
A neighborhood park’s service area generally corresponds to an
elementary school’s service area. A neighborhood park should
be large enough and have adequate facilities for active
recreation, including playgrounds and limited athletic facilities.
Parks in this category are primarily designed to serve children
and adolescents. Neighborhood parks range in size from two to
ten acres and have a service area from one-quarter to one-half
mile. Rosemead’s neighborhood parks include Zapopan Park
and Sally Tanner Park.

Mini-parks
Mini-parks are small parks under one acre in size and generally
designed to serve preschool-aged children. These parks or tot
lots have a very small service area. Klingerman Park is an
example of a mini-park.
Specialty Park/Facility
The City maintains the 3.5-acre Jess Gonzalez Sports Complex
park, which cannot be easily classified according to the above
criteria. Certain types of recreational uses are so distinct that
typical standards may not apply. Other specialty facilities
include the pedestrian and bicycle trails planned within the
electric power transmission easement and along the Alhambra
Wash.
Greenbelt
Greenbelt parks are small areas 0.75 acres or less that include
designated open space, landscaping, and/or recreation.
Rosemead has four Greenbelt parks: Angelus Park, Guess Park,
Olney Park, and Triangle Park.
Whittier Narrows Golf Course
The Whittier Narrows Golf Course is a 27-hole golf course
located on 260 acres of the Whittier Narrows Park. The golf
course includes amenities such as a grass driving range,
practice greens, banquet facility, and a restaurant.
Open Space Resources
Open space contributes to the economic, social, and physical
health, safety, and welfare of residents.         Private lawns,
landscaping, and public open space in parks, playgrounds, and
civic facilities make up the bulk of the City's open space. In
addition to the parks described above, significant open space
areas that benefit residents are: 1) the Southern California
Edison easement, and 2) the Whittier Narrows Recreational
Area, located east of the City limits in unincorporated Los
Angeles County.
Open space also can facilitate groundwater recharge and
stormwater management. Figure 4-1, Resource Management
Policy Map, identifies the local waterways in and near
Rosemead. The City is substantially built out and contains little
natural habitat. Riparian habitat is limited due to the
channelization of local streams. There are no wildlife corridors
in the City due to urbanization.
Rosemead has not established any flood corridors, defined here
as areas where annual flooding takes place. The areas of the
City where there is flooding potential, especially as due to dam
inundation, are identified in the Public Safety Element.

Park Facility Standards
Standards for recommended park space vary. The National
Parks and Recreation Association (NPRA) recommends a
minimum of 2.5 acres of park space per 1,000 persons. The
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
recommends for a minimum of 4 acres per 1,000 persons.
Based on the City's 2008 estimated population of 57,422
persons (California Department of Finance), the City should
provide a minimum of 144 acres of park land to meet the NRPA
standards, and 230 acres per SCAG guidelines.
Table 4-1 lists Rosemead’s park and open space, and includes
the Whittier Narrows Recreational Area, a 1,092-acre regional
park immediately southeast of the City. Whittier Narrows
Recreation Area offers significant recreational opportunities,
such as fishing, shooting ranges, and trails. Approximately 25
percent of City residents live within a one-mile radius of
Whittier Narrows Dam Recreation Area, and approximately 80
percent live within a two-mile radius. Excluding Whittier
Narrows, the City has approximately 43.25 acres of parkland.
According to NRPA and SCAG recommendations, the City lacks
approximately 101 and 187 acres of parkland, respectively.

Other Available Recreation Resources
As the few remaining vacant parcels in Rosemead develop,
parks and open space will become increasingly difficult to
acquire and fund. Rosemead’s public school facilities offer
opportunities to expand active recreational
options. The City and the local school districts
have established joint-use agreements to
maximize use of limited local open space and
recreational facilities. The State recognizes the
relationship between school sites and their
potential for recreational use. Education Code
Section 35275 requires that school boards meet
with park and recreation officials to coordinate the
design of new parks. Education Code Section
39363.5 requires that in cases where surplus
school sites are disposed of, first priority must be
given to park recreational purposes. The policies
contained in this Element encourage the
continuation of the shared use of school sites for
recreational purposes, as well as availability of City facilities for
special school functions. Rosemead’s schools provide
recreational facilities including ball fields, soccer fields, and
playgrounds. Many of these school facilities are underutilized
and gated to prevent or restrict public use during non-school
hours. Working collaboratively with the Rosemead, Garvey,
Alhambra, El Monte, and Montebello school districts,
Rosemead will seek out opportunities to allow for recreational
use of school facilities by residents.

Public Art
Public arts projects can help create strong connections between
residents of Rosemead and places in the City. Along with
façade and streetscape improvements, public art projects can
help redevelop and reinvigorate underutilized corridors in the
City. Public art projects also have the potential to enliven civic
spaces and strengthen a sense of community identity. Public
art in Rosemead can provide opportunities to observe the City’s
rich history and celebrate its unique and diverse population.
Parks, Open Space, Greenbelt, and
Public Art Goal and Policies
Goal 1:          Provide high-quality parks, recreation,
                 and open space facilities to meet the
                 needs of all Rosemead residents.
Policy 1.1:      Maintain current parks within the City to ensure
                 they continue to provide Rosemead residents the
                 best possible recreational opportunities.

Greenspace                                    Issues,
Goal, and Policies
In addition to the City’s parks and open space facilities,
commercial, industrial, and residential districts can provide
greenspace in the form of landscaping and street trees.
Increasing the amount and quality of greenspace promotes a
positive physical image, creates identity for all types of
development, and provides shade and cooling benefits.
As part of the overall City aim of enhancing the visual quality of
the urban environment and encouraging pedestrian activity,
City policies, programs, and standards will provide for
commercial and industrial property owners to landscape
properties with turf, trees, and shrubs.           Of particular
importance are setback areas and parking lots open to public
view. In commercial areas, improved greenspace creates a
landscape aesthetic inviting to pedestrians. Neighborhoods
near industrial areas benefit from greenspace as it softens views
toward parking lots, loading areas, trash enclosures, etc. Well-
designed greenspace also improves the quality of single and
multi-family neighborhoods and is considered a necessity
rather than an amenity.
Southern California communities continue to place increased
demands on existing water supplies; consequently, there is a
greater focus on water conservation, not just in times of
drought, but in anticipation of future population growth. Many
private landowners and public authorities are adopting
alternative forms of landscaping as an environmentally
responsible alternative to conventional, water-intensive
horticultural landscaping. Xeriscape is the philosophy of water
conservation through creative landscaping. Xeriscape is a
landscape that uses plants with low water requirements,
making them able to withstand extended periods of drought.
Properly maintained, a xeriscape can easily use less than one-
half the water of a traditional landscape. Once established, a
xeriscape should require less maintenance than turf landscape.
Goal 2:         Increase         greenspace         throughout
                Rosemead        to    improve       community
                aesthetics, encourage pedestrian activity,
                and provide passive cooling benefits
Policy 2.1:     Increase landscaping and tree plantings along all

Water                       Consumption
and Quality Issues,
Goal, and Policies
Rosemead, like the entire greater Los Angeles basin, is semi-
arid, with relatively limited annual rainfall. Early settlers drew
local groundwater resources for agricultural and domestic
water needs. As the region grew, increasingly more wells
tapped into groundwater basins. In many areas, groundwater
levels have declined as water use continues to exceed natural
recharge through rainfall and stream flow. Much of Southern
California now relies upon imported water to greatly
supplement local resources, both to meet volume demands and
to ensure water quality meets state and federal drinking water
standards.
The City’s location in arid Southern California underscores the
importance of continued education regarding wise water use
and water conservation technologies.           The City remains
committed to water conservation strategies that ensure a
healthy, clean, and reliable supply of water remains available
for residents. The City encourages the use of simple water
conservation measures in homes and in the workplace.
Water resources are limited to the groundwater basins that
provide a local source of water to the City and the surrounding       Cemented Rio Hondo flood control channel
region. Rosemead is located above the San Gabriel Basin, a
groundwater basin drained by the San Gabriel River and the
Rio Hondo. The groundwater basin is bounded by the San
Gabriel Mountains to the north, San Jose Hills to the east,
Puente Hills to the south, and Raymond Fault to the west. Local
groundwater accounts for a major portion of the area’s water
supply. Three of the groundwater purveyors in the City are: the
Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, the South
San Gabriel System (serves half of Rosemead), and the
California Water Service Company.
Due to past San Gabriel Valley industrial practices, the basin
has been contaminated with a variety of pollutants ranging
from pesticides to industrial chemicals and solvents. According
to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), over 30 square
miles of San Gabriel Valley groundwater may be contaminated.
The contaminated sites underlie Rosemead and other San
Gabriel Valley communities. Although the federal government
is responsible for cleanup of the area and initiated a
comprehensive remediation program in 1994, Rosemead is
committed to reducing the further contamination of
                                                                                   P A G E     4 - 1 3

underground water. The City participates in Los Angeles
County’s NPDES program to reduce the amount of water
polluted by pesticides, engine oil, and household chemicals that
run into the storm drain system and pollute groundwater. As
part of this effort, the City must comply with the County’s
Stormwater Quality Management Program and implement Best
Management Practices (BMPs) in several areas including public
outreach, planning and construction, public agency activities,
business inspections, and illicit connection and flow.
Goal 3:          Manage the use of and protect water
                 resources that provide supplies to
                 Rosemead residents and businesses.
Policy 3.1:      Work with water suppliers to ensure that
                 adequate water resources continue to be
                 available to meet the needs of residents and
                 business.
Policy 3.2:      Promote water conservation measures, reduce
                 urban runoff, and prevent groundwater
                 pollution associated with development projects,
                 property maintenance, City operations, and all
                 activities requiring City approval.
Policy 3.3:      Work with local, regional, and State agencies to
                 maintain and improve the quality of local
                 groundwater and to provide a cost-effective and
                 equitable means of reducing urban runoff.
Policy 3.4:      Adopt and enforce regulations and engage in
                 educational efforts to eliminate groundwater
                 and urban runoff pollution.
Policy 3.5:      Take steps to use reclaimed water whenever and
                 wherever possible in both public and private
                 facilities.
Air Quality and Energy
Conservation Issues,
Goal, and Policies
Every day, the average person breathes thousands of gallons of
air, yet our air is contaminated by smog emanating from
automobiles, industrial processes, and daily activities. These

pollutants are responsible for a range of respiratory and
cardiovascular diseases, reduced tolerance for exercise,
impairment of mental functions, and reduced plant growth.
Although air quality has localized impacts, it is a regional
problem created throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area.
Every city must accept a portion of responsibility for addressing
air quality problems. Rosemead is located within the South
Coast Air Basin, a geographic area that extends from the Pacific
Ocean north to the San Gabriel Mountains and east to the San
Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains. Due to topography,
climate, and daily pollutant emissions, the basin is a non-
attainment area for ambient air quality standards for ozone,
carbon monoxide, and fine particulate matter. Although the air
is much cleaner today than it was 40 years ago and continued
reductions in pollutant concentrations are expected, the basin
is not expected to meet air quality standards in the foreseeable
future.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)
works to improve regional air quality and to achieve federal and
state standards for various air pollutants. According to
SCAQMD, air quality has improved since the latter decades of
the last century due to lower energy consumption, improved
auto emission standards, and use of alternative modes of
transportation.
Due to Rosemead’s location adjacent to two freeways, local air
quality is affected most by vehicle emissions, railway
transportation, and industrial uses in adjacent communities.
Although the City has no direct ability to manage programs for
emissions control, Rosemead supports the regional Air Quality
Management Plan measures to help reduce air pollution.
Energy conservation is another important strategy to improve
air quality and preserve natural resources. Pollutants are
generated by the burning of fossil fuels and natural gas to
produce electricity.      Conserving energy contributes to
improvements in air quality. Buildings are one of the major
contributors to electricity demand. Energy requirements and
pollutants associated with energy generation can be reduced
through architectural designs, building construction, and
landscaping. The City promotes energy conservation through
the implementation of State of California Title 24 energy
performance requirements in building codes.              Title 24
establishes standards for minimum ceiling, wall, and raised
floor insulation; minimum heating, ventilating, air conditioning
and water heating equipment efficiencies; and other
requirements that help reduce energy use.

Goal 4:          Effective contributions to regional efforts
                 to improve air quality and conserve
                 energy.
Policy 4.1:      Integrate air quality planning with City land use,
                 economic development, and transportation
                 planning efforts.
Policy 4.2:      Support programs that reduce air quality
                 emissions related to vehicular travel.
Policy 4.3:      Support alternative transportation modes and
                 technologies, and develop bike- and pedestrian-
                 friendly neighborhoods and districts to reduce
                 emissions associated with automobile use.
Policy 4.4:      Encourage energy conservation efforts and the
                 incorporation of energy-saving designs and
                 features into new and refurbished buildings.
Policy 4.5:      Encourage public employees to follow energy
                 conservation procedures.
Policy 4.6:      Adopt a Climate Action Plan or Policy to address
                 greenhouse gas mitigation.

Issues,                         Goal,                   and
Policies
The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975
(SMARA) requires that all cites consider mapped mineral
resources designations (as defined by the State Mining and
Geology Board) in long-term planning efforts. SMARA was
enacted to promote the conservation and sensitive use of
significant mineral deposits. The law ensures that significant
aggregate resources are recognized and considered before land
use decisions are made that may compromise the long-term
availability of these resources.
The State Mining and Geology Board classifies lands in
California based on availability of mineral resources. Four
Mineral Resources Zone (MRZ) designations have been

established for the classification of sand, gravel, and crushed
rock resources:
         MRZ-1 – Adequate information indicates that no
          significant mineral deposits are present or likely to be
          present.
         MRZ-2 – Adequate information indicates that
          significant mineral deposits are present or there is a
          high likelihood for their presence, and development
          should be controlled.
         MRZ-3 – The significance of mineral deposits cannot
          be determined from the available data.
         MRZ-4 – There is insufficient data to assign any other
          MRZ designation.
According to the State Mining and Geology Board, land within
Rosemead is classified as MRZ-1, MRZ-3, and MRZ-41. Figure
4-2 identifies the extent of these classifications.
As Rosemead is completely urbanized and the State has not
identified any significant recoverable mineral resources, no
mineral extraction activities are permitted within the City
limits.
Policy Map and Plan
The goals and policies in this Element emphasize maintenance
and preservation of existing open space and recreation
resources, and making provisions for additional open space in
areas of the City considered deficient. The more difficult
policies to implement regard the provision of additional open
space due to the scarcity and cost of available land. Figure 4-1
identifies areas where the City can look to provide new or
enhance existing park and recreation facilities, which may
include working with school district officials to improve joint-
use field space.
Implementation of certain policies will result in the addition of
public and private greenspace in the City. Street tree plantings
will occur in particular along portions of Valley Boulevard,
Garvey Avenue, San Gabriel Boulevard, and Del Mar Avenue.
Other corridor treatments will be considered for Rosemead
Boulevard as funds allow. With regard to landscaping on
private properties, the City will establish new standards in the
zoning ordinance to ensure new development integrates well-
planned, functional, and attractive plantings that enhance the
adjacent public realm.

           regarding the development and implementation
           of viable water management programs to
           enhance water supply reliability.
Action 3.2 Enforce regulations and guidelines and update
           them as needed to meet the specific needs in the
           planning area to manage stormwater flows. This
           may include requirements for on-site detention
           or retention that implement the NPDES
           program, enhance groundwater recharge,
           complement regional flood control facilities, and
           address applicable community design policies.
Action 3.3 Adopt a water pollution control ordinance or
           policy to regulate urban runoff discharges to the
           storm drain system in coordination with
           regional efforts.
Action 3.4 Participate in developing and implementing a
           public information program regarding the
           appropriate use of herbicides and fertilizers to
           limit pollutants entering the storm drain system.

PUBLIC SAFETY
                                                          R OSEMEAD   G ENERAL    PL  AN
T             he Public Safety Element identifies and addresses
             the natural and human-caused hazards that may
             influence the development, redevelopment, and
utilization of properties in Rosemead. Foremost, this Element
identifies the ways to reduce the risk of property damage,
injuries, or loss of life in the event of a natural or human-
caused disaster.
According to the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research,
the Safety Element works to “reduce the potential risk of death,
injuries, property damage, and economic and social dislocation
resulting from fires, floods, earthquakes, landslides, and other
hazards.” This Public Safety Element sets forth policies
designed to minimize threats from natural and human-caused
hazards. By implementing the directives of the Public Safety
Element, the City intends to use available planning methods in
order to: 1) minimize risk exposure, 2) provide timely
emergency service delivery to all residents and businesses when
the need arises, and 3) maintain an optimal environment for
personal security. While population growth and changing
needs within the community will continue to place demand on
resources, Rosemead is committed to enhancing the safety of
neighborhoods, business districts, and public places.
The Public Safety Element is one of the required General Plan
elements. The City emphasizes a proactive approach to
                                                                                 P A G E 5 - 1

planning, which involves identifying and avoiding or mitigating
hazards present in the environment that may adversely affect
property and threaten lives. Government Code Sections
65302(g) and 65302(f) identify several issues to consider in
such planning efforts, as does California Health and Safety
Code Section 56050.1. In Rosemead, safety issues of concern
include:
       Geologic hazards, including (non-seismic) slope
        failures; collapsible, compressible or expansive soils
        subsidence due to groundwater pumping; and shallow
        ground water.
       Seismic (earthquake) hazards, including surface fault
        rupture, ground shaking, liquefaction effects, and
        earthquake-induced slope instability’s;
       Flooding (inundation) from seismically induced dam
        failure;
       Urban fires; and
       Presence of hazardous materials.
Geologic, Seismic, and
Flooding Conditions
Introduction and General Setting
The information on the geologic, seismic, and flooding
conditions within and around the City are summarized briefly
in this section. Information is derived from readily available
technical documents that can be referred to for more details as
necessary to evaluate and analyze individual projects;
additional technical background information is presented in
Appendix A. Issues due to hazards arising from the geologic,
seismic, and dam failure-induced flooding conditions in the
City are discussed in a following section.
A geologic, seismic, or dam failure-induced flooding event that
would impact a portion of the City has the potential to affect
persons and property in the City. These issues and their
potential impacts are the basis for establishing the goals and
policies to protect lives and property. Discussion is also
provided regarding the buildings and infrastructure most
important to the citizens and City personnel in the event
earthquake effects are particularly severe in the City.
The technical issues summarized in Appendix A must be taken
into account as the City of Rosemead expands, fills in, and re-
develops. Existing building codes and land use planning

requirements can address most of the hazards inherent in the
geologic setting of the City. As newer, more accurate geologic,
soils, and seismic information has been developed since the last
General Plan update, it is now possible to identify many of the
areas in the City vulnerable to natural hazards, and account for
the hazards in future development.             Sources for this
information range from generalized regional reports and maps
(including the previous General Plan Seismic Element) to
project-specific geotechnical and engineering geology reports.
Geology and Soils
Geologic units at and near the ground surface in Rosemead are
presented by Yerkes and Campbell (2005; Figure 5-1). The
southernmost portion of the City abuts the Montebello Hills,
which consist of sandstone, siltstone and conglomerate of the
Fernando formation (map symbol Tf). The remainder of the
City, north of the hills, is underlain by older alluvium (Qof,
Qof1, and Qoa) and younger alluvial fan deposits (Qyf) shed
from the surrounding hills, various young stream wash deposits
(Qw, Qyw), landslide deposits (Qls) associated with the
Fernando Formation, and artificial fill (Qaf) along the freeways
and in at least one large tract development. These geologic
units have physical characteristics that can produce hazards
such as landslides, mudslides, collapsible or expansive soils,
subsidence, or shallow groundwater. Appendix A provides
more detailed descriptions of the geologic units (Table 5-1)
and the hazards associated with the unit characteristics of these
geologic units.
Seismicity/Earthquake Ground shaking, and Faults
Figure 5-2 (Shaw et al., 2002; California Geological Survey
[CGS, formerly the California Division of Mines and Geology-
CDMG], 2005) shows the regional faults that would impact the
City should a moderate to large earthquake be generated on any
of these seismic sources within about 25 miles of Rosemead.
Earthquakes resulting in ground shaking characterized by
greater than 20 percent the acceleration of gravity (g) can be
expected on the Whittier (magnitude [M] 6.8), Puente Hills (M
7.1), Upper Elysian Park (M 6.4), Raymond (M 6.5), Sierra
Madre (M 7.2), Verdugo (M 6.9), San Jose (M 6.4), Hollywood
(M 6.4), and Clamshell-Sawpit (M 6.5) faults. The only known
active fault at the surface within the City (Figure 5-3; CDMG,
1991) is the Alhambra Wash fault (zoned as an Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zone [APEFZ]). However, there are several
other unnamed fault segments or suspected faults of unknown
age of last movement mapped across the City (Figure 5-4;
Treiman, 1991; Yeats, 2004). Potential seismic/earthquake
hazards include surface fault rupture, ground shaking,
earthquake-induced liquefaction (including lateral spreading
and     ground      failure)   and    landslides   (shown      on
                                                                               P A G E 5 - 3

Figure 5-5; CDMG, 1999). The City is also underlain by two
buried thrust faults that, although they do not reach the ground
surface, have the potential to cause strong ground shaking in
Rosemead. These hazards and the local earthquake faults are
discussed further in Appendix A.
Flooding
According to flood maps prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), no part of Rosemead lies within
a 100-year or 500-year flood zone. Regional drainage
improvements, including historic improvements to the Rubio
and Alhambra Washes, adequately protect the City from
flooding associated with major storm events. FEMA Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) indicate that most of the City is
subject to minimal hazard from flooding (Figure 5-6). State
law, as revised in 2007 (AB 162), identifies this as a flood
hazard zone, although limited flood risk is associated with this
classification. A small portion of the City on the south border is
an unstudied area and as such flooding hazards are unknown.
Rosemead has an adopted and FEMA approved flood plain
management ordinance that substantially complies with AB
162.
State law (AB 162) also requires General Plans to identify
existing and planned development in flood hazard zones,
including structures, roads, utilities, and essential public
facilities. As noted above, nearly the entire City is located in an
area subject to minimal flood risk. Refer to Figure 2-1 in the
Land Use Element for allowable development throughout the
City, and Figure 4-1 of the Resource Management Element for
utilities (Edison power lines and related easement). Refer to
Figure 5-8 for a map of important facilities, all of which are
located within areas of minimal flooding risk. As of 2009,
awareness floodplain mapping provided by the Department of
Water Resources was not available for the City of Rosemead.
While general flooding from storm events is not common in
Rosemead’s history, several dams, which continually or
sometimes impound water, have the potential to fail during a
large earthquake and flood portions of the City. These are the
Whittier Narrows Dam, Santa Fe Dam/Reservoir, and Garvey
Dam/Reservoir. Failure of any of these dams during a time
when significant water is impounded could cause inundation of
residences, businesses, and infrastructure.           Figure 5-7
(California Office of Emergency Services, 2009; National
Geographic Society, 2003) shows the potential flood areas
associated with this potential hazard, which is discussed further
in Appendix A.

Human Activities
Businesses and residents in Rosemead are subject to potential
hazards associated with earthquakes, hazardous materials
incidents, fires, and other conditions that may impact
infrastructure and impede emergency response. Each type of
disaster requires focused planning to minimize the risks to life
and property when a disaster occurs. The period following a
disaster is often very difficult for communities and can be, at
times, as devastating as the disaster itself. Cities that prepare
ahead of time can reduce the fear, confusion, and loss resulting
from catastrophic incidents. Planning efforts need to ensure
access to critical facilities such as police and fire, hospitals and
emergency care facilities, schools, utilities, roadways, and
freeways.
Rosemead participates in the Standardized Emergency
Management System (SEMS) that provides a statewide
framework for coordinating multi-agency responses to
emergencies and disasters. The City’s SEMS incorporates
mutual aid agreements with other jurisdictions, establishes
lines of communication during emergencies, and standardizes
incident command structures. The City has also complied with
the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA)
requirements to prepare a disaster mitigation plan in
accordance with the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. The plan
represents Rosemead’s commitment to reducing the risk from
natural hazards and serves as a guide for the use of available
City resources. This plan also helps the State provide technical
assistance and prioritize project funding.
Rosemead contracts with the Los Angeles County Sheriff and
the Los Angeles County Fire Department for provision of
emergency response and law enforcement services. This
arrangement allows the City to more readily adjust staffing to
meet the changing needs of businesses and residents. Also,
County agencies can easily provide supplemental responses
from any other Sheriff or Fire Department stations.

Fire Hazards
Structural fires represent the primary fire hazard in Rosemead.
Structural fires are generally caused by faulty equipment or lack
of knowledge of fire prevention precautions. The potential for
fire hazards increases when flammable and explosive materials
are improperly stored, handled, or used. Planning for adequate
fire protection and suppression in a densely built community
like Rosemead becomes increasingly important due to aging
buildings, and proximity of residences to commercial and
industrial uses.
The County of Los Angeles Fire Department has two fire
stations in Rosemead:
        Station 4, located at 2644 N. San Gabriel Boulevard
        Station 42, located at 9319 E. Valley Boulevard
As noted above, any County fire unit may respond to incidents
in Rosemead, depending on need and availability.               In
particular, special hazardous materials response units from the
stations are available. The City will coordinate with the County
Fire Department to implement fire hazard education and fire
protection programs. In addition, the City will coordinate with
local water districts to ensure water pressure is adequate for
fire fighting purposes.
Adequate water flow and pressure is determined through the
application of Regulation No. 8 of the Fire Code. This code sets
standards for new development and existing development.
Hazardous Materials
Commercial and industrial businesses in Rosemead and
adjacent communities use hazardous materials.              These
businesses include dry cleaners, film processors, auto service
providers, landscape contractors, and paint shops. Larger
businesses can generate, use, and/or store large quantities of
hazardous products. The current regulatory environment
provides a high level of protection from the hazardous
materials manufactured, transported to businesses, and stored
within Rosemead. Federal, State, and County agencies enforce
regulations for hazardous waste generators and users.
According to the California Environmental Protection Agency,
as of 2006, approximately 49 hazardous waste generators are
located within the City of Rosemead.
                                                                             P A G E 5 - 2 1

P U B L I C    S A F E T Y
Rosemead’s land use pattern generally separates industry from
residential uses.      However, commercial freight carriers
transporting hazardous substances along the I-10 and SR-60
freeways, along major truck routes such as Rosemead
Boulevard, or along railways present potential hazards. All
motor carriers and drivers involved in the transportation of
hazardous materials must comply with the requirements of
federal and State regulations, and must apply for and obtain a
hazardous materials transportation license from the California
Highway Patrol. When transporting explosives, inhalation
hazards, and highway route-controlled quantities of radioactive
materials, safe routing, and safe stopping places are required.
The City has established truck routes, these roadways that must
be used by larger trucks and any vehicle specifically carrying
hazardous wastes and materials.
The Los Angeles County Fire Department, Health Hazardous
Materials Division tracks hazardous materials handlers to
ensure appropriate reporting and compliance. The Division
inspects businesses that generate hazardous waste, conducts
criminal investigations, provides site mitigation oversight, and
undertakes emergency response operations. Such inspections
reduce risks associated with exposure to hazardous materials
and adverse environmental effects.           The County Fire
Department’s Emergency Operations Section provides 24-hour
emergency response services to hazardous materials incidents.
Emergency responders identify unknown substances, monitor
spills and releases for safe and immediate mitigation, and
identify responsible parties for payment of cleanup costs. The
Inspection Division of the Fire Department’s Emergency
Operations section inspects hazardous material handling and
hazardous waste-generating businesses to assure compliance
with applicable laws. Additionally, Inspection Division staff
responds to medical waste emergencies, assists law
enforcement agencies with response to illegal drug labs, and
investigates resident and business complaints.
The City hosts “Household Hazardous Waste Roundup” events
sponsored by the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County
and the Los Angeles County of Public Works. The County’s
Household Hazardous Waste Collection Program collection
events allow residents to dispose of hazardous materials safely
and at no cost to them.

Statutes and Plans of
Other Agencies
The federal and State governments – in recognition of safety
issues affecting broad geographic areas – have adopted
programs with their public safety planning efforts.
California Building Code
Beginning in 2007, rather than using the Uniform Building
Code, California instead adopted the 2006 International
Building Code (IBC) with substantial local amendments. The
IBC is developed and published by the International Code
Council (ICC), which was formed in 1994 by a merger of the
three national building code publishers. During January and
February 2007, the California Building Standards Commission
(http://www.bsc.ca.gov) adopted, in sections, the 2007
International Building Code (IBC).         The new California
Building Code (CBC) became effective July 1, 2006, and local
codes were adopted 180 days later. Effective January 1, 2008,
all new construction in Rosemead must be done in accordance
with the 2007 CBC.
The 2007 California Building Code (CBC) is a fully integrated
code based on the 2006 International Building Code. Part 2
now also includes Title 24, Part 8 (California Historical
Building Code) and Title 24, Part 10 (California Existing
Building Code). The California Building Standards Code is
comprised of twelve parts that incorporate public health and
safety standards used in the design and construction of
buildings in California. The codes also include standards for
energy efficiency and access compliance for persons with
disabilities. Structures such as dams and freeways fall under
criteria developed by various State and Federal agencies.
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning
Act
The 1972 Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act seeks to
mitigate the hazard of fault rupture by prohibiting the
placement of structures for human occupancy across the trace
of an active fault. The State Geologist is required to compile
maps that delineate earthquake fault zones (AP zones) along
faults that are "sufficiently active" and "well defined." Cities
and counties are responsible before issuing building permits for
                                                                            P A G E 5 - 2 3

a Project to assure that a geologic investigation is performed to
demonstrate that proposed buildings will not be constructed
across active faults. The fault evaluation and written report for
the specific site must be prepared by a geologist registered in
the State of California. If an active fault is found, a structure for
human occupancy cannot be placed over the trace of the fault
and must be set back a safe distance from the fault. A Project is
carefully defined, but generally includes all land divisions and
most structures for human occupancy, although some
exceptions are allowed and local agencies can be more
restrictive than state law requires. An AP zone map has been
compiled by the State Geologist for the City of Rosemead area
(CDMG, El Monte Quadrangle, 1991; Figure 5-3) and defines an
AP zone for the Alhambra Wash fault within the City.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
California’s     1990     Seismic      Hazards     Mapping       Act
(http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/shzp) requires the State
Geologist (CGS) to compile maps identifying and describing
seismic hazard zones in California, with emphasis given to the
urbanized areas in Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange counties
in southern California, and Alameda, San Francisco, San Mateo
and Santa Clara counties in northern California. Seismic
hazards considered include amplified shaking due to local
geological or geotechnical conditions, liquefaction, and
earthquake-induced landslides. Guidelines prepared by the
State Mining and Geology Board identify the responsibilities of
State and local agencies in the review of development within
seismic hazard zones. Development on a site that has been
designated as a seismic hazard zone requires a geotechnical
report and local agency consideration of the policies and
criteria established by the Mining and Geology Board. A
seismic hazard zones map (Figure 5-5) delineates the areas
within or near Rosemead that may be susceptible to
liquefaction and earthquake-induced landslides.
Unreinforced Masonry Building Law
In 1986, California enacted a law that required local
governments in Seismic Zone 4 to inventory unreinforced
masonry (URM) buildings, to establish a URM loss-reduction
program and report progress to the state by 1990. Each local
government can tailor its program to its own specifications to
allow for each jurisdiction to take political, economic, and
social priorities into account. This law requires 366 local
governments in the highest Seismic Zone 4 to:

        Inventory URM buildings within each jurisdiction.
        Establish loss reduction programs for URM buildings by
         1990.
        Report progress to the California Seismic Safety
         Commission.
In addition, the law recommends that local governments:
        Adopt mandatory strengthening programs by
         ordinance.
        Establish seismic retrofit standards.
        Enact measures to reduce the number of occupants in
         URM buildings.
California’s Seismic Safety Commission (2006) monitors local
government efforts to comply with this law and reports to the
state’s Legislature. The City of Rosemead had seven URMs;
five have been strengthened and two were demolished. The
City is in compliance with mitigation requirements.
National Flood Insurance Program
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
administers the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
Participating jurisdictions must exercise land use controls and
purchase flood insurance as a prerequisite for receiving funds
to purchase or build a structure in a flood hazard area.
Rosemead has participated in the program since 1979 and as of
2007, no special flood hazard areas have been identified in the
City. The NFIP provides federal flood insurance subsidies and
federally financed loans for eligible property owners in flood-
prone areas. Rosemead is identified on the National Flood
Insurance Program’s Flood Insurance Rate Maps as being
within Zone X, an area outside the 100- and 500-year flood
zones, and thus subject to minimal flooding. Nevertheless,
nearly 25 percent of the flood claims received by FEMA on an
annual basis occurred in areas outside the 100- and 500-year
flood zones. Associated hazards in hillside areas and at the
base of hills or bluffs can include severe erosion, mudflows and
debris flows.
Standardized Emergency Management
System (SEMS)
All cities in California are required to adopt a SEMS plan to
establish procedures and responsibilities of various City staff in
the event of an emergency. A SEMS Plan allows cities to
                                                                              P A G E 5 - 2 5

quickly respond to any large-scale disaster that requires a
multi-agency and multi-jurisdictional response.
National Incident Management System
(NIMS)
NIMS is the federal equivalent to the SEMS response plan. The
Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (OES) is the lead
agency for the adoption, promotion, and implementation of
NIMS.
Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000
The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 provided a new set of
mitigation plan requirements that emphasize State and local
jurisdictions to coordinate disaster mitigation planning and
implementation.      States are encouraged to complete a
“Standard” or an “Enhanced” Natural Mitigation Plan.
“Enhanced” plans demonstrate increased coordination of
mitigation activities at the State level, and if completed and
approved, will increase the amount of funding through the
Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. California recently updated
its State Hazard Mitigation Plan which will require approval by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) by
October 8, 2007. The State of California Plan was adopted on
October 7, 2007 and approved by FEMA Region IX on
December 17, 2007.
USA PATRIOT Act
Signed into law on October 26, 2001, the USA PATRIOT Act
expanded the authority of U.S. law enforcement. The Act
included the identification of federal crimes for attacks on
public transportation and the use of biological weapons, and
increased government surveillance powers to track activities
related to homeland security and terrorism.

Elements
The Public Safety Element relates most closely to the Land Use
Element. Policies and plans in the Public Safety Element are

designed to protect existing and planned land uses from
specific types of hazards.
Issues,                      Goals,                    and
Policies
Certain human activities and natural conditions discussed in
the Public Safety Element create hazards in Rosemead. These
hazards in turn pose risks to individuals and properties that
affect how we may develop and use property. Risk from such
hazards can be reduced or avoided by recognizing the hazards
and adopting and implementing land use and emergency
response policies that provide the degree of protection the
community desires.
These goals, policies, and implementation actions focus on: (1)
reducing risks from natural hazards; (2) preparing for
emergency situations; and (3) reducing risks from hazards
associated with hazardous materials.
Natural Hazards
This section presents information on hazards related to
geologic and soil units, active and potentially active faults,
earthquakes, secondary seismic effects (e.g., liquefaction and
dam inundation flooding) that affect policy and long-range
planning in the City of Rosemead.
Geology and Soil Hazards
Geotechnical and engineering geology reports prepared for
development and re-development projects in the City are
required to identify geologic and soil hazards, as well as routine
geologic and soils conditions important to the design and
construction of the project (Figure 5-1). These reports are
required to undergo review by qualified professional engineers
and geologists to assure that the information, results,
conclusions, and recommendations meet the state of the
professional practice.       Primary hazards considered are
landslides, mudflows, general slope instability, unstable soils
due to expansion or consolidation, subsidence, and shallow
groundwater. Where these hazards are present, damage to
structures and potentially serious injuries to individuals can
occur. Proper mitigation of these hazards is required to
prevent or reduce the potential damage to structures, injuries,
and the loss of life. The City Planning, Building and Safety, and
Public Works Departments shall continue to collectively assure
                                                                              P A G E 5 - 2 7

that proper reports are prepared, reviewed, and approved in
accordance with City, County, State, and Federal guidelines, as
applicable.
Seismic/Earthquake Ground Shaking Hazards
As discussed above, there are eleven known faults within about
30 miles of Rosemead (shown on Figure 5-2) that pose an
earthquake ground shaking hazard to the City of Rosemead.
Standard construction (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial)
is governed by the California Building Code (currently the 2007
version) and the City must adopt measures necessary to assure
that these codes are followed. Knowledge of the sedimentary
basin depth and geometry beneath the City of Rosemead are
important for the proper estimation of earthquake ground
motions.
The expected moment magnitudes and median peak horizontal
ground accelerations shown in Appendix A are for planning
purposes; individual projects require site-specific design
earthquake determinations depending upon the uses associated
with the project and whether the project is considered an
essential services facility or other type of important structure.
Projects in the City may fall within the jurisdiction of County,
State, or Federal agencies (e.g., Caltrans, Division of the State
Architect, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency)
with more or less stringent earthquake design criteria. It is the
responsibility of the City to protect the lives and property of the
citizens of Rosemead by submitting input to these agencies to
assure, to the maximum degree possible, their consideration for
the application of the proper earthquake design factors.
Active and Potentially Active Surface Fault Rupture
Hazard
Total damage/collapse of structures and severe injury can
result if surface rupture occurs beneath or in the immediate
vicinity of a building.       Based on the geologic, seismic,
groundwater, and tectonic/fault studies that have been
conducted to date within and adjacent to the City of Rosemead.
it is concluded that: (1) the Alhambra Wash fault (a trace of
Whittier fault as is the East Montebello fault) is the only known
active surface fault crossing the City and studies required by the
APEFZ Act (Figure 5-3) are necessary; (2) the northwest-
trending escarpment of Bullard and Lettis (1993), and various
aerial photograph lineaments described by Treiman (1991;
Figure 5-4), should be considered as potentially active faults
with 200-foot wide “fault hazard management zones” (FHMZs)
requiring special investigation on a case-by-case basis for new
or significantly modified “important” facilities (defined below),
and (3) the northwest trending groundwater barrier (CDWR,
P A G E    5 - 2 8
A P R I L    1 3 ,   2 0 1 0

                                                                    P U B L I C    S A F E T Y
1966) in east-central Rosemead is not considered to be active
and is not included with a FHMZ.
Secondary Seismic Hazards
Local geological conditions may create additional hazards
associated with seismic activity.         Large and moderate
earthquakes produce ground-shaking effects that may result in
ground failure.       Figure 5-5 shows areas susceptible to
seismically induced liquefaction. In locations where shallow
groundwater levels and loose, unconsolidated soils occur
together, a condition called liquefaction can occur, when the
area is subjected to strong ground shaking. Soils that liquefy
lose the ability to support structures; buildings may sink or tilt,
with the potential for extensive structural damage.
Liquefaction presents the most prominent secondary
earthquake ground failure issue in Rosemead. Seismically
induced landslides have the potential to occur in a limited area
in the south of Rosemead, but proper geotechnical investigation
and mitigation will minimize these secondary seismic hazards.
Liquefaction-related lateral spreads can occur adjacent to
stream channels and deep washes that provide a free face
toward which the liquefied mass of soil fails. Lateral spreads
can cause extensive damage to pipelines, utilities, bridges,
roads and other structures.
California law (Seismic Hazard Mapping Act) requires
identification of liquefaction-susceptible zones, where the
dynamic (under seismic conditions) stability of the foundation
soils must be investigated, and seismically-induced landslide
zones, where the stability of hill slopes must be evaluated.
Within these areas, geologic studies must be completed and
countermeasures undertaken in the design and construction of
important infrastructure and buildings for human occupancy.
California law also requires disclosure of these hazards as a part
of all real estate transactions within the identified areas. The
City shall continue to (1) apply the State seismic hazard zoning
regulations at the earliest possible stage in the development
process, (2) identify these hazards at the project development
permit stage to assure proper design measures are
implemented, and (3) inform at an early stage applicants
planning to develop heavy structures or structures over two-
stories that the areas with historic high groundwater less than
30-feet deep are most susceptible to liquefaction and lateral
spread landslides where adjacent to channel-type slopes.
Dam Inundation Flooding Hazards
Rosemead does not have natural floodplain areas, although it is
bordered by the Rio Hondo in its eastern and southeastern
extremes. Dam failure can be caused by strong earthquake
ground shaking or a seiche event, erosion, improper siting
and/or design, and rapidly rising floodwaters during heavy
                                                                               P A G E 5 - 2 9

storms. Such a dam failure can be instantaneous or gradual,
depending on many factors (e.g., the cause and dams building
materials).       Resulting release of water can also be
instantaneous or gradual, with either situation potentially
causing injuries, loss of life, property damage, displacement of
persons residing within the inundation path, and damage to
infrastructure. Portions of the City are located within dam
inundation areas for the Whittier Narrows Dam, Santa Fe
Dam/Reservoir, and Garvey Dam/Reservoir (Figure 5-6).
Given the City’s distance from the Pacific Ocean, it’s exposure
to tsunami hazards resulting from offshore earthquakes is nil.
Natural Hazard-Related Goals and Policies
The overarching natural hazard related goal is stated below to
provide the basic purpose and strategy adopted by the City of
Rosemead to address safety concerns posed by natural hazards.
Goal 1 has several policies that are more specific guidelines and
tactics that will be used to meet Goal 1.                     Finally,
implementation actions, the specific steps to be taken to satisfy
the goal and policies, are presented in a subsequent section.
Underlying Goal 1 is the precept that all buildings and
structures in the City of Rosemead should conform to the
appropriate building standards in order to protect every citizen
to the degree practical. In consideration of certain hazard
zones referred to in the Safety Element, the City has defined the
category “Important” building or structure in considering new
or substantially refurbished existing facilities that should
receive     increased      consideration    for    geologic,     soil,
seismic/earthquake, and flood hazard avoidance. An important
facility, which would not apply to existing buildings of the types
described below unless substantial refurbishment were
proposed, would be defined by the City Planning Director, the
City Engineer, and the City Building Official for each case, as
appropriate. In general “Important” would include, but not
necessarily be limited to:
    (1)      One whose function is judged as essential following
             a severe natural hazard such as an earthquake, e.g.,
             police, fire, City communications center, and
             hospitals, in order to provide for the safety and well-
             being of the citizens of Rosemead;
    (2)      A structure that is critical to the City’s recovery
             following     a    severe   earthquake,      i.e.,   key
             transportation/evacuation         routes,       bridges,
             over/underpasses, electrical substations and towers,
             natural gas/fuel pipelines;
    (3)      Structures that may be sensitive to earthquake
             hazards (e.g., liquefaction and ground shaking), e.g.,
             buildings greater than 2-stories, pre-1971 tilt-ups,
             non-retrofitted buildings, soft-story construction,

            non-ductile reinforced concrete, and parking
            garages; and
    (4)     Buildings that may have significant populations,
            and/or high-population densities, i.e., schools/pre-
            schools, nursing homes, and locations with limited
            mobility populations.
Goal 1:        The City of Rosemead will act in
               cooperation with federal, State, and
               County agencies responsible for the
               enforcement         of    planning      statutes,
               environmental laws, and building codes
               to minimize, to the extent practical, risks
               to people and property damage, risks
               related economic and social disruption,
               and other impacts resulting from 1)
               geologic and soil hazards, 2) seismic
               hazards including primary and secondary
               effects of seismic shaking, fault rupture,

               deformation in Rosemead, and 3) dam
               failure-induced flood and inundation
               hazards, while reducing the disaster
               recovery time due to hazard incidents in
               Rosemead. The City of Rosemead will
               consider undertaking a HAZUS-based
               loss estimation analysis to more fully
               quantify potential physical damage,
               economic loss, and social impacts from
               these events.
Policy 1.1:    Geology and Soil Hazards
               a) Encourage development in low hazards areas
               and implement actions that minimize changes to
               the natural topography and drainages, while
               protecting public safety and reducing potential
               property damage due to geologic and soil
               hazards through the use of proper design and
               construction techniques.
               b) Assure that all aspects of the geotechnical and
               engineering     geology     evaluation     process
               (planning, investigation, analysis, reporting,

                 professionals.
Policy 1.3:      Flood Hazards
                 a) Minimize development of Important
                 Facilities in areas with potential for flood
                 inundation to the extent possible in order to
                 protect public safety and reduce potential
                 property damage due to dam failure-induced
                 flooding.    Maintain      the   structural     and
                 operational integrity of essential public facilities
                 during flooding.
                 b) Assure that all aspects of the dam failure
                 flood/inundation evaluation process (planning,
                 investigation, analysis, reporting, review,

                 and independently reviewed, by qualified
                 professionals.
                 c) Minimize the risks of flooding to new
                 development. Carefully evaluate whether new
                 development should be located in a flood prone
                 area or potential dam inundation area, and
                 identify construction methods or other methods
                 to minimize damage if new development is
                 located in these areas.
                 d) Establish cooperative working relationships
                 among public agencies with responsibility for
                 flood protection

Fire Protection and Law Enforcement
The Los Angeles County Fire Department provides service from
two stations in Rosemead.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department serves the City of
Rosemead from the nearby Temple Station. In addition to
providing patrol and investigative services, the Sheriff offers a
broad range of support services, including Neighborhood
Watch coordination, community education programs, drug
prevention education for school children, and homeland
security. A key crime prevention program the Department runs
is the Community/Law Enforcement Partnership Program, or
CLEPP. Sheriff’s Department staff shall help communities
mobilize and organize against gangs, drugs, and violence by
working through schools, community-based organizations,
local businesses, churches, residents, and local governments.
Goal 3:        Provide high levels of public safety,
               emergency          response,        and       law
               enforcement services.

               and fire codes are maintained and implemented.
Policy 3.2:    Include the Fire Department in the review
               process of proposed projects to ensure that fire
               prevention and suppression features have been
               considered in the overall design.
Policy 3.3:    Require that any structures identified as
               deficient in fire protection or lacking adequate
               suppression devices make recommended
               improvements in a time frame established by the
               Fire Department.
Policy 3.4:    Work with local water service providers to
               ensure that private water distribution and
               supply facilities have adequate capacity to meet
               both the water supply needs of the community
               and required fire flows. Service planning should
               include methods to address earth quake induced
               damage to water storage and distribution
               facilities.

                 provided by the County Sheriff and County Fire
                 Department, and adjust the service levels as
                 needed to meet changing community needs.
Policy 3.7:      Take full advantage of community policing,
                 education, and crime prevention programs
                 available through the County Sheriff’s
                 Department.
Policy 3.8:      Incorporate crime prevention considerations
                 into the development project review process,
                 where applicable.
Policy 3.9:      Develop and implement a periodic inspection
                 program for multi-family units over three units
                 and mixed-use projects.
Policy 3.10:     Consider the adoption of a citywide emergency
                 evacuation plan and emergency shelter plan.
Policy Map and Plan
Rosemead’s approach to mitigating public safety hazards and
reducing loss of life, injury, and property damage in the City
focuses on emergency preparedness. The policies contained in
this element include requirements that the City maintain an
up-to-date regional emergency response system, procedures for
educating the public about the importance of emergency
preparedness, and programs to ensure that emergency
equipment and supplies are maintained to adequately meet the
needs of the City in an emergency situation.
Implementation of the goals and policies in this Element will
have the beneficial effect of reducing potential fire hazards in
the City. The replacement of older, deteriorating structures and
the requirement that owners maintain their properties and
incorporate of up-to-date fire-suppression devices in structures
will reduce the occurrence of structural fires in the City.
Figure 5-8 identifies designated hazardous materials transport
routes and evacuation routes, as well as fire stations, medical
facilities, and potential emergency centers. The City has

Natural Hazard Safety
Goal 1:        The City of Rosemead will act in
               cooperation with federal, State, and
               County agencies responsible for the
               enforcement          of     planning    statutes,
               environmental laws, and building codes
               to minimize, to the extent practical, risks
               to people and property damage, risks
               related      to      economic      and     social
               disruption, and other impacts resulting
               from 1) geologic and soil hazards, 2)
               seismic hazards, including primary and
               secondary effects of seismic shaking, fault
               rupture, and other earthquake-induced
               ground deformation in Rosemead, and 3)
               dam        failure-induced         flood      and
               inundation hazards, while reducing the
               disaster recovery time due to hazard
               incidents in Rosemead. The City of
               Rosemead will consider undertaking a
               HAZUS-based loss estimation analysis to
               more fully quantify potential physical
               damage, economic loss, and social
               impacts from these events.
Action 1.1     Review County and special district capital
               improvement plans for consistency with the
               seismic safety policies governing the location of
               critical public facilities.

                residents and businesses in the City on a regular
                basis.
Action 1.5      Create a website or link on the City of Rosemead
                website that includes links to readily available
                published geologic, soil, and earthquake hazard
                maps covering the City, and links to the City
                statutes,     plans,    and    codes     governing
                development and re-development projects. Use
                the site to communicate to the public
                information about geologic and soil, seismic, and
                dam inundation flood hazards and City
                requirements, including but not limited to a)
                specify sources to identify licensed professionals
                such as California Registered Geotechnical
                Engineers and Certified Engineering Geologists,
                b) seismic design and construction requirements
                for individuals and developers applicable to new
                and existing property improvements, c) City

                Evacuation Plan (as required by Government
                Code Section 65302) that addresses structural
                hazards, landslides and slope stability,
                liquefaction, inundation from dam failure,
                seismic activity, and other natural disasters.
Action 1.7      Encourage only the minimum grading necessary
                to create suitably sized and safe building areas.
Action 1.8      Avoid grading and development that requires
                filling natural drainages or changing natural
                surface water flow patterns.
Action 1.9      As required by law and statute, the City shall
                implement applicable federal, State, and County
                regulations related to geologic and soils
                investigations,      analyses,    designs,     and
                construction, including but not limited to
                implementing the most up-to-date California
                Building Code (CBC) provisions regarding
                lateral forces (Chapter 23) and grading (Chapter
                70), and incorporate and adopt Los Angeles

                (2002 or subsequent document, as amended)
                guidelines for evaluating and mitigating
                landslide hazards.
Action 1.16     As required by law and statute, the City shall
                implement applicable federal, State, and County
                regulations related to earthquake hazard
                investigations,       analyses,    designs,     and
                construction, including but not limited to the
                adoption of applicable sections of the current
                California Building Code and the County of Los
                Angeles       Geotechnical       Guidelines,    and
                compliance with the State Alquist-Priolo
                Earthquake Fault Zoning Act and the Seismic
                Hazards Mapping Act requirements.
Action 1.17     Ensure that no structure for human occupancy,
                other than single-family wood-frame and steel-
                frame dwellings that are less than three stories
                and are not part of a development of four units
                or more, shall be permitted within fifty feet of an
                active fault trace as defined by geologic
                investigations conducted in accordance with the
                intent of the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
                Zoning Act, and the guidelines contained in the
                California geological survey notes 48 and 49.
Action 1.18     Encourage most new construction in areas with
                a minimum of identified earthquake-related and
                flood-related hazards.
Action 1.19     Minimize to the maximum extent practical the
                construction of important structures (e.g.,
                critical, essential, sensitive, and high-occupancy
                buildings and critical infrastructure) within
                known, or suspected earthquake-related hazard
                zones.
Action 1.20     The City shall require geologic and seismic
                studies as part of Important Facilities
                development proposals within established 200-
                foot wide Fault Hazard Management Zones

            identified in the State Fault Evaluation Report
            222 (Treiman, 1991; as shown on Figure 5-3), in
            other peer-reviewed reports (e.g., Bullard and
            Lettis, 1993), and in future City fault hazard
            management zone study reports (as applicable).
            Within the FHMZ along the escarpment of
            Bullard and Lettis (1993) investigations shall be
            conducted for facilities as required under the
            Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
            (APEFZ) only if new data are developed for an
            Important Facility investigation in this FHMZ or
            from some outside study (e.g., California
            Geological Survey, U. S. Geological Survey, or
            the Southern California Earthquake Center) that
            indicates this escarpment is sufficiently active to
            require such APEFZ-level investigations.
            Investigation and reporting requirements for
            FHMZs shall mirror those for Alquist-Priolo
            Earthquake Fault Zones and California
            Geological Survey Notes 48 and 49. FHMZs
            shall be updated periodically based on the
            results of studies conducted in the City, which
            may cause the FHMZs to the expanded, reduced,
            or removed.
Action 1.21 Where construction of important structures
            (e.g., critical, essential, sensitive, and high-
            occupancy buildings and critical infrastructure)
            within known, or suspected earthquake-related
            hazard zones is proposed, require proper
            geotechnical      and      engineering     geology
            investigations and reports that include necessary
            analyses of (for example) strong ground shaking,
            fault rupture, liquefaction, lateral spreading,
            ground subsidence and slope instability, and
            that provide necessary design recommendations
            for grading and site stability, such as building
            setbacks, special foundation considerations,
            dewatering, ground improvement, and other
            stabilization or remediation measures.
Action 1.22 Require routine and special inspection of
            investigation sites (e.g., fault exploration

               sensitive, and high-occupancy buildings and
               critical infrastructure).
Action 1.24    As required by law and statute, the City shall
               implement, where applicable, federal, State, and
               County regulations related to hydrology and
               flood investigations, analyses, designs, and
               construction, including but not limited to
               continued participation in the National Flood
               Insurance Program.
Action 1.25    Minimize to the maximum extent practical the
               construction of Important Facilities (e.g.,
               critical, essential, sensitive, and high-occupancy
               buildings and critical infrastructure) within
               potential dam failure-induced flood/inundation
               areas.
Action 1.26    Require proper hydrology and flooding
               investigations and reports that include necessary
               analyses of (for example) pre- and post-
               development flow characteristics, changes to
               surface       drainage       network,      potential
               environmental impacts on existing development
               down-gradient from new construction in
               upstream areas, and adequacy of current and
               proposed culverts, debris basins, and storm
               drain systems.
Action 1.27    As appropriate, require new development to be
               designed to provide protection from potential
               impacts of flooding resulting from dam
               inundation, consistent with evolving State and
               federal guidelines and the City’s flood plain
               management ordinance, and as directed by the
               City Engineer.

            Knowledge of the sedimentary basin depth and
            geometry beneath the City of Rosemead are
            important for the proper estimation of
            earthquake ground motions. In addition to the
            amplifications and resonances caused by shallow
            softer alluvium, there are complex interactions

               between the three dimensional geometry of the
               basin and the seismic waves that have been
               shown to increase the amplitude and duration of
               shaking during an earthquake. Interactions may
               focus the wave energy to a surface location from
               the bottom of the basin leading to a
               concentration of intensity of shaking in small
               regions. Likewise, the edges of basins appear to
               trap incoming seismic waves, thereby increasing
               the duration of shaking in the basin. Basin
               depth and geometry can be estimated using tools
               available through the Southern California
               Earthquake Center (SCEC) website, which will
               assist developers and City building officials in
               ensuring compliance with the 2-percent in 50-
               years event requirements in the 2007 CBC.
               Other information important to proper code

Introduction
N             oise has become a key factor in the perception of the
              quality of our environment. Noise affects both the
              home and work environment and the enjoyment of
recreational activity. For these reasons, noise is an important issue
in the community planning process. The Noise Element of a
general plan is a comprehensive program to limit the exposure of
the community to excessive noise levels. The Element identifies
current and projected noise levels for existing and planned uses
within the City of Rosemead. The projected noise levels are used
to guide future land decisions to limit noise and its effects on the
community, including noise-sensitive land uses. Potential noise
sources are identified and programs established to avoid or mitigate
noise impacts associated with community development. The
information contained in the Noise Element will also provide
baseline levels and noise source identification for local noise
ordinance enforcement.
The State recognizes the relationship between noise and noise
sensitive uses and has adopted guidelines for Noise Elements. This
                                                                                   P A G E 6 - 1
                                                                          O C T O B E R   2 0 0 8

Noise Element satisfies the requirements of State planning law and
is a mandated component of the General Plan. Government Code
Section 65302(f) establishes the required components of the Noise
Element. The Element also complies with California Health and
Safety Code Section 56050.1 guidelines for Noise Elements.
The City of Rosemead strives to reduce the impacts of noise
through a combination of land use planning, site criteria, noise
reduction, and enforcement strategies. The policies and programs
detailed in this Element focus on protecting the quality of life
found within our residential neighborhoods, schools, and other
noise-sensitive uses from the persistent hazards of excessive noise.
Relationship                             to            Other
Elements
The Noise Element requires the consideration of any possible
adverse impacts related to noise in decision-making concerning
future development. For this reason, the goals and policies in the
Noise Element must be considered when implementing policies
outlined in the Land Use Element. The Noise Element is also
linked to the transportation policies in the Circulation Element.
The projected noise contours identified in Figure 6-1 within this
Element directly correspond to the Circulation Plan and the
projected traffic generated from proposed land uses. Both the
Noise and Circulation Elements contain policies and programs to
minimize the effects of transportation noise. The Noise Element
also relates to the Resource Management Element. Excessive noise
can diminish enjoyment peaceful environment and enjoyment of
parks and other designated open space. As a result, noise levels are
considered during the planning of new project including
recreational and open space areas. Additionally, open space areas
can be used to separate and buffer noise sensitive land uses from
noise producers.

Other Plans
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
Guidelines
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by
the State legislature in response to a public mandate for project
environmental analysis that might affect the environment.
Excessive noise is considered an environmental impact under
CEQA. The provisions of the law and environmental review
procedures are described in the CEQA Statutes and the CEQA
Guidelines. Implementation of CEQA ensures that during the
decision making stage of project development, City officials and
the general public will be able to assess the noise impacts among
other environmental impacts associated with public and private
development projects.
California Noise Insulation Standards (Title 24)
The California Commission of Housing and Community
Development officially adopted noise standards in 1974. In 1988,
the Building Standards Commission approved revisions to the
standards (Title 24, Part 2, California Code of Regulations). As
revised, Title 24 establishes interior noise standards for residential
space.    Acoustical studies must be prepared for residential
structures that are to be located within noise contours of 60 dB(A)
or greater from freeways, major streets, thoroughfares, rail lines,
rapid transit lines or industrial noise sources. The studies must
demonstrate that the building is designed to reduce interior noise
to 45 dB(A) or lower.
City of Rosemead Noise Control Ordinance
The City has adopted a Noise Control Ordinance (Chapter 8.36)
that sets maximum exterior noise levels for residential, commercial,
and industrial land uses and maximum interior noise levels for
residential uses. It establishes ambient noise level limits that apply
according to the land use zone and time of day. The ordinance
provides controls for excessive and annoying noise from stationary
sources such as industrial plants, pumps, compressors, and
                                                                                P A G E 6 - 5

refrigeration units. Certain noise sources are prohibited and the
ordinance establishes an enforcement process.
Measuring Noise
Noise generally is defined as unwanted or intrusive sound. Since
noise consists of pitch, loudness, and duration, describing noise
with a single unit of measure presents a challenge. The A-weighted
decibel scale (dB[A]) has been developed to describe the loudness
of a sound or sound environment based on the sensitivity of the
human ear.
The dB(A) descriptor only reports noise from a single source or
combination of sources at a point in time. To allow a more
comprehensive description of the noise environment, federal and
State agencies have established noise and land use compatibility
guidelines that use averaging approaches to noise measurement.
Two measurement scales commonly used in California are the
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and the day-night
level (Ldn). To account for increased human sensitivity at night,
the CNEL level includes a 5-decibel penalty on noise during the
7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. time period and a 10-decibel penalty on
noise during the 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. time period. The Ldn level
includes only the 10-decibel weighting for late-night noise. These
values are nearly identical for all but unusual noise sources.
Baseline Noise
Environment
To establish a baseline against which to measure changes in the
community noise environment over time, a noise modeling effort
was conducted, with 2007 serving as the baseline year. Since traffic
noise represents the dominant noise source in Rosemead, the
model focuses on the 24-hour ambient noise conditions resulting
from roadway travel. Figure 6-1 shows noise exposure contours for
baseline year 2007.
Transportation-Related Noise
Freeway and major arterial roadways represent the major sources of
traffic noise as shown in Figure 6-1. Although noise levels are lower

for secondary highways, they are also a significant source of traffic
noise. Almost all commercial areas in the City are affected by
traffic noise since they are located adjacent to the main
thoroughfares or freeways. Given the impact of traffic noise within
the planning area and due to the predominance of residential uses
in the City, many residential areas are also affected by noise. As
indicated in Figure 6-2, the majority of the City’s residential areas
are located within the >60 and >70 db(A) CNEL noise contours.
This map outlines non-noise sensitive areas, revealing residential
uses for the remainder of the City, and also indicates the locations
of schools and parks. All of the schools in the City are located
within the >60- and >70 db(A) CNEL noise contours. Six of the
seven City parks are located within the >55 and >65 db(A) CNEL
noise contours.
The City has little direct control over noise produced by
transportation sources because State noise regulations for motor
vehicles and rail preempt local regulations. As the City cannot
control noise at the source, City noise programs focus on reducing
the impacts of transportation noise on the community.
Non-Transportation Noise and Land Use
Planning
Excessive noise can be considered an environmental pollutant that
can damage hearing and affect general well-being. Noise becomes a
concern when it consistently interferes with a person’s ability to
conduct everyday work and recreation activities. Noise sources can
include commercial and industrial activities, car alarms, loud
music, noise generated from large gathering and typical residential
neighborhood sounds such as lawnmowers, children at play, and
barking dogs. In Rosemead, the noise impacts from these sources
are outweighed by traffic-related noise.
Regardless of the type of noise, levels are highest near the source
and decrease with distance. Noise becomes a problem when
sources and noise sensitive land uses are located in adjacent areas.
Residential uses are generally the most sensitive to noise. Other
noise-sensitive land uses include schools, libraries, offices, hospitals,
churches, hotels, motels, and outdoor recreational areas. Mixed-
use projects often present unique problems in this area, such as
                                                                                   P A G E 6 - 7

when restaurants with nighttime entertainment are located below
residential units. Most noise impacts can be avoided when noise
sources, sensitive land uses, and information about the future noise
environment are considered in planning and development
decisions.
The City’s primary goal with regard to community noise is to
minimize the exposure of residential neighborhoods, schools, and
similar land uses to excessive or unhealthy noise levels to the extent
possible given built-out conditions. Toward this end, the Noise
Element establishes noise/land use compatibility guidelines based
upon cumulative criteria for outdoor noise. Figure 6-3 outlines the
criteria the City will use when reviewing development proposals.
New residential development will comply with Title 24 standards.
In addition, strict enforcement of the City Noise Ordinance can
improve noise conditions within Rosemead.
Year 2025 Noise
Environment (Build-out
Year)
The Land Use Element indicates that Rosemead will accommodate
residential and commercial growth through the year 2025. The
major noise sources in Rosemead will continue to be transportation
related: freeways, major arterial roadways, and trains. To a lesser
degree, industrial sources can be significant noise sources. These
sources, as well as individual stationary and industrial noise
generators, must be considered in the planning process to ensure
long-term noise compatibility.
Regional growth will contribute to increased traffic volumes
citywide and along major roadways, and could lead to elevated
traffic noise levels and noise impacts associated with the Union
Pacific Railway and major regional rail transportation projects such
as the Alameda Corridor East (ACE). Union Pacific operates two
railroad lines within the City, one running through the northern
boundary of the City and the other parallel to the I-10 Freeway.
The ACE runs freight trains on one track parallel to the northern
boundary of the City. The City’s land use policies do not
encourage development of heavy industrial uses that produce noise,
and the City plans to work with the Alameda Corridor East Joint

Powers Authority, when feasible, to ensure that noise impacts
associated with increased traffic along the Alameda Corridor East
(ACE) do not adversely impact Rosemead.
Potential future ambient noise levels can be estimated by
modeling. Figure 6-4 displays projected year 2025 noise contours
based upon future traffic levels and railroad operations. The City
will experience very little change in ambient noise levels due to
traffic. For planning purposes, the change will be imperceptible.
Issues, Goals, and Policies
Three issues are addressed by the goals, policies and
implementation actions of the Noise Element: (1) avoiding the
negative impacts of noise through land use planning and noise
reduction measures; (2) minimizing the impact of transportation
related noise; and (3) minimizing the impact of non-transportation
related noise.
Goal 1:          Effective incorporation of noise considerations
                 into land use planning decisions.
Policy 1.1:      Ensure compliance with standards for interior and
                 exterior noise established within the Noise Element
                 and Zoning Code.
Policy 1.2:      Require      new       multiple-family    residential
                 development to comply with State regulations if
                 they are to be located in areas where ambient noise
                 levels exceed 60 dB.
Policy 1.3:      Periodically review and update the Existing Noise
                 Contours Map to ensure that any future noise
                 increases not considered in the Noise Element will
                 be identified.
Policy 1.4:      Encourage acoustical design in new construction.
Policy 1.5:      Require sound walls to be constructed in
                 designated mixed-use districts where noise-sensitive
                 land uses are located on adjacent properties.

                 City departments involved in noise abatement.
Implementation Actions
Goal 1:          Effective incorporation of noise avoidance
                 considerations into land use planning decisions.
Action 1.1       Enforce the City Noise Ordinance, which specifies
                 acceptable limits of noise for various land uses
                 located throughout the City.
Action 1.2       Incorporate noise reduction features during site
                 planning to mitigate anticipated noise impacts on
                 affected noise sensitive land uses. The noise
                 contours, illustrated on the Existing Noise
                 Contours Map, identify areas within the City
                 exposed to noise levels greater than 60dB CNEL
                 and shall be used to identify locations of potential
                 conflict.       Require acoustical analyses, as
                 appropriate, for proposed residential development
                 within the 60 dB CNEL or higher contour. New
                 developments will be permitted only if appropriate
                 mitigation measures are included.
Action 1.3       Enforce provisions of the California Noise
                 Insulation Standards (Title 24) that specify that
                 indoor noise levels for multi-family residential
                 living spaces shall not exceed 45 dB CNEL. The
                 standard is defined as the combined effect of all
                 noise sources, and is implemented when existing or
                 future exterior noise levels exceed 60 dB CNEL.
                 Title 24 further requires that the standard be
                 applied to all new hotels, motels, apartment houses,
                 and dwellings other than detached single-family
                 dwellings. The City will additionally apply the

Action 1.4 As a condition of development approval, new
           commercial and industrial projects located adjacent
           to residential areas shall demonstrate reduction of
           potential noise impacts on neighboring residential
           development to acceptable levels.
Goal 2:    Reduced noise impacts from transportation noise
           sources.
Action 2.1 Enforce State Motor Vehicle noise standards for
           cars, trucks, and motorcycles through coordination
           with the California Highway Patrol and the County
           of Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department.
Action 2.2 Encourage industrial and commercial activities to
           restrict their receiving operations to daytime
           periods.
Action 2.3 Require new commercial/industrial/mixed use
           development proposals to designate delivery and
           loading/unloading areas away from residential uses.
Action 2.4 Work with other jurisdictions and agencies to
           monitor and decrease noise levels.
Goal 3:    Effective implementation of measures to control
           non-transportation noise impacts.
Action 3.1 Enforce the comprehensive community noise
           ordinance to ensure that City residents are not
           exposed to excessive noise levels from stationary
           noise sources including but not limited to
           gatherings, entertainment devices, loudspeakers,
           loading and unloading, powered model vehicles,
           and vehicle repairs and alarms.
Action 3.2 All new residential projects to be constructed near
           existing stationary sources of noise (including but
           not limited to industrial activities, commercial
           facilities, and public parks with sports activities)
           must achieve a minimum of 20 dBA of building
                                                                        P A G E 6 - 1 9

                number of residential units permitted near existing
                stationary sources of noise.
Action 3.3      Reduce construction-related noise using control
                measures at all construction sites, including but not
                limited to the use of mufflers on construction
                equipment or the physical separation or machinery
                from adjacent residential uses.
Action 3.4      The Planning Division shall act as the City noise
                control coordinating agency and will ensure the
                continued operation of City noise enforcement
