When the General Plan is completed, it will
maintain consistency between individual
elements. The Housing Element, the first
element to be updated, was adopted in June
2003. It addresses the type, availability,

Element, which are closely tied, are the next
two elements that have been updated. The
circulation element, which addresses the
transportation network that allows people,

with the Land Use Element.            It was

Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                               Page 2-25

2.0 – Land Use Element
    Policy 2.1.11

    techniques such as landscaping, setbacks, screening and, where necessary, construction of
    sound walls.
    Policy 2.1.13
    When considering large-scale development projects, the City may require a Specific Plan
    (SP) or Planned Unit Development (PUD) approach that allows flexibility in development
    standards in return for creativity in design and other project amenities. Uses that
    undermine the overall intent of the General Plan policies and Land Use Diagram shall not
    be permitted.
    Policy 2.1.14
    Encourage projects to utilize Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) and New
    Urbanist design principles when such projects would provide tangible public benefit.
          Program 2.1.A
          The City shall complete a comprehensive revision of the Zoning Code following
          adoption of the General Plan. The updated code shall establish zoning districts and
          overlays, revise the zoning map, adopt requirements for Specific Plan (SP) and Planned
          Unit Development (PUD) submittals and processing, and adopt appropriate regulations
          for all new General Plan designations and overlays.
          Program 2.1.B

          General Plan.
          Program 2.1.C
          A fiscal impact analysis shall be required as part of application submissions for projects
          with the potential for significant fiscal impacts. The City shall adopt appropriate
          standards and requirements for the fiscal impact analysis.
          Program 2.1.D
          Require new development to construct and dedicate infrastructure and public facilities
          to the City, and/or to pay impact and other fees that represent the development’s
          respective fair share of the cost of installation, operation and maintenance of those
          facilities and services as a condition of project approval.
          Program 2.1.E
          The City shall develop a capital improvements plan for the extension of sewer, water,
          and other municipal services.

of Monterey County. The County stretches
approximately 100 miles along California’s
central coast, covering approximately 3,324
square miles. The total county population,
according to the 2000 Census, is 390,391
(not including the prison population in
Soledad). Greenfield’s 2000 population was
12,583. Greenfield’s population is growing
at a significantly faster rate than the county
growth rate. While the county’s change in
population from 1990 to 2000 was
approximately 13.0%, Greenfield’s was
68.6%.
Greenfield is surrounded by land designated
as prime farmland in the Monterey County
General Plan. Other Salinas Valley cities
include Salinas, Soledad, and Gonzales to
the north and King City to the south.
Land Use Designations and Zoning
Compatibility Table
One of the most familiar methods of
implementing General Plan land use policy
and designations is through the Zoning
Ordinance. Although separate from the
General Plan, it is essential that the zoning
districts be utilized to implement General
Plan land use designations that are
consistent with the intent of each General
Plan designation. Table 2-6 General
Plan/Zoning Compatibility Matrix identifies
each Land Use designation in the left
column and each zoning district along the
top row. Zoning districts considered
compatible with a General Plan designation
are marked with either a solid circle for
those zoning districts compatible with the
General Plan and a hollow circle for those
zoning districts that could be compatible
with the General Plan under particular
circumstances. Those that could be
compatible are discretionary and would
depend on the specific proposed use.
Because of the specific nature of zoning

To further the objective of providing a
well-designed and convenient bicycle and
pedestrian circulation system, a Bicycle and
Pedestrian Master Plan will be developed,
including design standards for bicycle and
pedestrian facilities, evaluation of current
bicycle promotion programs, analysis of
bicycle and pedestrian accidents, and a
capital improvement program to ensure
adequate maintenance of bicycle and
pedestrian facilities. The City will also
maintain an inventory of bicycle and
pedestrian facilities, which will allow
identification       of     gaps     in     the
bicycle/pedestrian       system    and     will
contribute to the development of the

                       Corridor Traffic Level of Service (LOS) Descriptions
LOS Descriptions
  A     Description includes free-flow conditions; vehicles are unimpeded and free to set their
        own speed. Maneuverability (ability to change lanes and merge) is very easy, and there
        are many gaps in the arterial traffic for vehicles to turn out of side-streets or driveways
        into the arterial. Most vehicles pass through signalized intersections without stopping.
        For freeways, the average speed is 65 mph or greater.
  B     Some restriction in the ability of drivers to set their own speed occurs, but overall
        conditions are very good. The average actual speed of travel (including stops) varies by
        type of facility and speed limit, but typically is 19-34 mph (including stops). Most
        freeway traffic flows at 65mph or greater, but slower vehicles may occasionally reduce
        speeds for some vehicles.
  C     Restrictions in maneuverability begin to occur; vehicle speeds are generally limited by
        the other vehicles in the traffic stream, but conditions are still generally acceptable to
        good. Depending on the type of street, the average speed is between 13 and 28 mph,
        including stops. Freeway traffic continues to flow smoothly, but the density of traffic
        impedes easy lane changes, and slower vehicles (trucks, RV’s, etc.) begin to have a
        noticeable impact on the speed of other vehicles. Average freeway speeds are
        generally close to 65 mph.
  D     Considerable restriction in the ability to maneuver or change lanes; number of
        vehicles waiting at signals (“queues”) may be quite long at some intersections. Arterials
        average 9 to 22 mph, depending on the street. Freeway traffic moves well (55-60 mph)
        but is very “tight”.
  E     Great restriction on maneuverability; vehicles on city streets may have to wait through
        more than repetition of lights (a “cycle”) to get through a signalized intersection.
        Arterial speeds are typically in the 7 to 17 mph range including stops. Freeway traffic is
        very dense with little ability to maneuver. Speeds can be erratic and vary greatly
        during the peak hour. As a freeway gets near its physical capacity, speeds will
        generally drop to 25 to 35 mph.
  F     Although LOS “F” does not automatically imply “gridlock”, speeds are low overall and
        delay is very high. At intersections, the stopped delay of all vehicles passing through
        the intersection averages more than a minute. Arterial speeds overall may be less than
        7 mph on business district streets, and less than 13 mph on other streets. Freeway
        speeds will be erratic with stop-and-go operation, but generally average at least 9 mph.
        Vehicles may wait at ramps to get on the freeway.

I. GROWTH CONTROL GOALS AND POLICIES
Goal 4.1
Provide for future growth and development as depicted in the Land Use Element by attaining
public facility and traffic levels of service necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
     Policy 4.1.1
     Analyze all development projects, such as subdivision maps or land use permits, for
     conformity with the growth management standards.
     Policy 4.1.2
     New development or major modifications of existing development shall construct all
     necessary on- or off-site infrastructure and public services needed to serve the project in
     accordance with City standards.
     Policy 4.1.3
     Direct growth toward areas with existing infrastructure.
     Policy 4.1.4
     Retain the City’s flexibility to determine the most cost effective and efficient manner to
     provide all public services.
          Program 4.1.A
          Prior to approval of any development project, the applicant shall demonstrate that
          traffic levels of service and performance standards outlined in the Circulation Element
          will be maintained, or that a funding mechanism and timeline has been established
          which will provide the infrastructure to meet the standards.
          Program 4.1.B
          If it cannot be demonstrated prior to project approval that levels of service will be met
          per Policy GM 4.1.1, the City may consider the development but defer its approval
          until the standards can be met or assured. In the event that a signalized intersection
          exceeds the applicable level of service standard, the City may approve projects which
          potentially impact the City only if the City can establish appropriate mitigation
          measures, determine that the intersection or portion of roadway is subject to a finding
          of special circumstances, or determine that the intersection or roadway segment is
          located on a route of regional significance.

          Require development projects with considerable drainage impacts to prepare a detailed
          drainage study by a registered engineer. The study shall include: detailed hydrologic
          modeling that considers land use, existing facilities, soil, and topographic data; erosion
          control and best management practices, descriptions of proposed flood control
          facilities; compliance with waste discharge requirements; cost estimates and
          construction schedule; and identification of the entity that is responsible for facility
          design and construction, Clean Water Program compliance, and facility maintenance.

REGIONAL AND STATE PARKS
Trail facilities also exist in surrounding
regional and state parks, including San
Lorenzo       Park,     Pinnacles    National
Monument, and Arroyo Seco Gorge.
A waling trail in the San Lorenzo park is
located along the banks of the Salinas River.
Arroyo Seco Campgrounds, part of the Los
Padres National Forest recreational area,
contain approximately 15.5 miles of
pedestrian and horse trail. Additionally,
these trails link to the Ventana Wilderness
network of trails. Arroyo Seco is located
approximately 17 miles west of Greenfield.
The Pinnacles National Monument lies
approximately 25 miles northeast of the City
of Greenfield. This facility contains over 30
miles of pedestrian trail.

SEISMIC HAZARDS
The City of Greenfield is located within the
Central Salinas Valley, which is bordered on
the east by the San Andreas Fault. Because
of the likelihood of an earthquake along its
length, the San Andreas has been classified
as an “active” fault as per the Alquist-Priolo
Special Studies Zones Act of 1972. Many
faults not classified as “active” by the
Alquist-Priolo Act are still considered by
geologists to be active and capable of
inflicting severe loss of life and property.
The closest potentially active fault to the
City of Greenfield is the Reliz/Rinconada
fault. No known historical earthquakes have
occurred on this fault; however, evidence
exists of late Quaternary activity. A
maximum expected magnitude earthquake
of 7.3 on the Richter scale has been
attributed to this fault.       Historical data
regarding seismically induced ground
failures in northern California (Youd and
Hoose, 1978) shows no recorded ground
failures within the City of Greenfield. Table
8-2 illustrates active and potentially active
faults near the City of Greenfield.

G         OALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Goal 9.1
Protect the community from the harmful and annoying effects of exposure to excessive noise.
    Policy 9.1.1
    Noise compatibility of proposed new development shall be determined based on the land
    use compatibility table shown in Figure 9-1 and the standards contained within Tables 9-1
    and 9-3 for determining noise compatibility.
    Policy 9.1.2
    New development of noise-sensitive uses shall not be allowed where the noise level due to
    non-transportation noise sources will exceed the noise level standards of Table 9-1 as
    measured immediately within the property line or within an outdoor activity area (location
    designated by the City) of the new development, unless effective noise mitigation measures
    have been incorporated into the development design to achieve the standards specified in
    Table 9-1.
    Policy 9.1.3
    Noise created by new proposed non-transportation noise sources shall be mitigated so as
    not to exceed the noise level standards of Table 9-1 as measured immediately within the
    property line of lands designated for noise-sensitive uses.
    Note: For the purposes of the Noise Element, transportation noise sources are defined as traffic on
    public roadways and aircraft in flight. Control of noise from these sources is preempted by Federal
    and State regulations. Other noise sources are presumed to be subject to local regulations, such as a
    noise control ordinance. Non-transportation noise sources may include industrial operations,
    outdoor recreation facilities, Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC) units, loading docks, etc.
    Policy 9.1.4
    Where a proposed non-residential land use is likely to produce noise levels exceeding the
    performance standards of Table 9-1 at existing or planned noise-sensitive uses, an acoustical
    analysis shall be required as part of the environmental review process so that noise
    mitigation may be included in the project design. The requirements for the contents of an
    acoustical analysis are provided in Table 9-2.
    Policy 9.1.5
    Noise created by a new transportation noise source shall be mitigated so as not to exceed
    the levels specified in Table 9-3 at outdoor activity areas or interior spaces of existing noise-
    sensitive land uses.
    Policy 9.1.6
    Existing noise-sensitive uses may be exposed to increased noise levels due to construction
    of roadway improvement projects as a result of increased roadway capacity, increases in
    travel speeds, etc. It may not be practical to reduce increased traffic noise levels consistent
    with those contained Table 9-3. Therefore, as an alternative, the following criteria may be
    used as a test of significance for roadway improvement projects:
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                     Page 9-3

9.0 – Noise Element
     i.   Where existing traffic noise levels are less than 60 dB Ldn at the outdoor activity areas
          of noise-sensitive uses, a +5 dB Ldn increase in noise levels due to roadway
          improvement projects will be considered significant; and
     ii. Where existing traffic noise levels range between 60 and 65 dB Ldn at the outdoor
          activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +3 dB Ldn increase in noise levels due to
          roadway improvement projects will be considered significant; and
     iii. Where existing traffic noise levels are greater than 65 dB Ldn at the outdoor activity
          areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +1.5 dB Ldn increase in noise levels due to roadway
          improvement projects will be considered significant.
     Policy 9.1.7
     Where noise mitigation measures are required to achieve the standards of Tables 9-1 and 9-
     3, the emphasis of such measures shall be placed upon site planning and project design.
     The use of noise barriers shall be considered a means of achieving the noise standards only
     after all other practical design-related noise mitigation measures have been integrated into
     the project.
     Note: Existing dwellings and new single-family dwellings may not be subject to City review with
     respect to satisfaction of the standards of the Noise Element. As a consequence, such dwellings may
     be constructed in areas where noise levels exceed the standards of the Noise Element. The City is
     not responsibility to ensure that such dwellings meet these noise standards, or the noise standards
     imposed by lending agencies such as U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
     the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the State of California Department of Veteran Affairs
     (Cal Vet). If homes are located and constructed in accordance with the Noise Element, it is expected
     that the resulting exterior and interior noise levels will conform to the HUD/FHA/Cal Vet noise
     standards.
     Policy 9.1.8
     Obtrusive, discretionary noise generated from residences, motor vehicles, commercial
     establishments, and/or industrial facilities should be minimized or prohibited.
     Policy 9.1.9
     Since activities associated with agricultural operations (such as crop dusting, tractor
     operations, and machinery operation, etc.) are recognized as noise sources that may be
     considered annoying to some residents, and these activities can occur during the daytime
     and nighttime hours, new development of residential uses adjacent to agricultural uses shall
     provide full disclosure of potential noise sources to future residents consistent with the right
     to farm ordinance anticipated for adoption by the City.
           Program 9.1.A
           The City has adopted and will update as necessary a Noise Ordinance to govern
           nuisance noise introduced by construction, or residential, commercial, or industrial
           uses. The purpose of this Ordinance is to regulate excessive noise produced by sources
           including, but not limited to, car stereos, parties, commercial and industrial activities
           (except where approved by the City), and other discretionary noise observed to be a
           nuisance to adjacent communities or businesses.
Goal 9.2
Protect the economic base of the City by preventing the encroachment of noise-sensitive land
uses into areas affected by existing noise-producing uses.

    Policy 9.2.1
    New development of noise-sensitive land uses shall not be permitted in areas exposed to
    existing or projected noise levels from transportation noise sources which exceed the levels
    specified in Table 9-3, unless the project design includes effective mitigation measures to
    reduce exterior noise and noise levels in interior spaces to the levels specified in Table 9-3.
    Where noise-sensitive land uses are proposed in areas exposed to existing or projected
    exterior noise levels exceeding the levels specified in Table 9-3 or the performance
    standards of Table 9-1, an acoustical analysis shall be required as part of environmental
    review so that noise mitigation may be included in the project design.

 1.      Each of the noise levels specified above shall be lowered by five dB for simple tone noises,
         noises consisting primarily of speech or music, or for recurring impulsive noises (e.g., humming
         sounds, outdoor speaker systems). These noise level standards do not apply to residential units
         established in conjunction with industrial or commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings).
2.       The City can impose noise level standards which are more restrictive than those specified above
         based upon determination of existing low ambient noise levels.
3.       Fixed noise sources which are typically of concern include, but are not limited to the following:
              HVAC Systems                     Cooling Towers/Evaporative Condensers
              Pump Stations                    Lift Stations

              Outdoor Speakers                 Blowers
4.       The types of uses which may typically produce the noise sources described above include but
         are not limited to: industrial facilities including pump stations, trucking operations, tire shops,
         auto maintenance shops, metal fabricating shops, shopping centers, drive-up windows, car
         washes, loading docks, public works projects, batch plants, bottling and canning plants,
         recycling centers, electric generating stations, race tracks, landfills, sand and gravel operations,
         and athletic fields.

                                  Requirements for an Acoustical Analysis
  An acoustical analysis prepared pursuant to the Noise Element shall:
  A.         Be the financial responsibility of the applicant.
  B.         Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental noise assessment
             and architectural acoustics.
  C.         Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and locations to
             adequately describe local conditions and the predominant noise sources.
  D.         Estimate existing and projected cumulative (20 years) noise levels in terms of Ldn or CNEL and/or
             the standards of Table 9-1, and compare those levels to the adopted policies of the Noise
             Element.
  E.         Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies and
             standards of the Noise Element, giving preference to proper site planning and design over
             mitigation measures which require the construction of noise barriers or structural modifications to
             buildings which contain noise-sensitive land uses.
  F.         Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures have been implemented.
  G.         Describe a post-project assessment program which could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of
             the proposed mitigation measures

Notes:
1.   For traffic noise within the City of Greenfield, Ldn and peak-hour Leq values are estimated to be approximately
     similar. Interior noise level standards are applied within noise-sensitive areas of the various land uses, with
     windows and doors in the closed positions.
2.   Outdoor activity areas for single-family residential uses are defined as back yards. For large parcels or residences
     with no clearly defined outdoor activity area, the standard shall be applicable within a 100-foot radius of the
     residence.
3.   For multi-family residential uses, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied at the common outdoor
     recreation area, such as at pools, play areas or tennis courts. Where such areas are not provided, the standards
     shall be applied at individual patios and balconies of the development.
4.   Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Ldn or less using a practical
     application of the best-available noise reduction measures, an exterior noise level of up to 65 dB Ldn may be
     allowed provided that available exterior noise level reduction measures have been implemented and interior
     noise levels are in compliance with this table.
5.   Outdoor activity areas of transient lodging facilities include swimming pool and picnic areas.
6.   Hospitals are often noise generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable only at
     clearly identified areas designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
7.   Only the exterior spaces of these uses designated for employee or customer relaxation have any degree of
     sensitivity to noise.

     commonly used during nighttime hours.
4.   Hospitals are often noise generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable only at
     clearly identified areas designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
5.   Only the exterior spaces of these uses designated for employee or customer relaxation have any degree of

6.   The outdoor activity areas of office, commercial and park uses are not typically utilized during nighttime hours.
General: The Table 5 standards shall be reduced by 5 dB for sounds consisting primarily of speech or music, and for
recurring impulsive sounds. If the existing ambient noise level exceeds the standards of Table 5, then the noise level
standards shall be increased at 5 dB increments to encompass the ambient.

Greenfield 2005 General Plan

                                                                             6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
1. INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the housing element is to identify and analyze existing and projected housing needs and
to provide goals, policies, and implementation programs for the preservation, improvement, and
development of housing. The framework of the Goals and Policies will guide the community’s decision
making for the following eight years.
Greenfield was incorporated as a general law city in 1947. The population as of the 2013 U.S. Census
was 16,494 persons with 3,632 housing units. Greenfield is located in the southern portion of Monterey
County, approximately seven miles south of Soledad and approximately twelve miles north of King City.
The Gabilan Mountain Range borders the valley on the east, with the Santa Lucia Mountain Range to the
west. Primary access is provided via U. S. Highway 101. Its central location in the Salinas Valley on
Highway 101 places it within a major transportation hub of the state. The dominant market influence is
provided by the nearby agricultural industries and local service establishments. In recent years, housing
demand has begun to diversify geographically with commuters traveling from areas as far away as
Monterey and the San Jose area for affordable housing.
As an element of the City of Greenfield General Plan, the goals, policies, and implementation programs
included will apply only to the incorporated area of the City of Greenfield and that area within the City’s
Sphere of Influence and Planning Area. This updated Housing Element covers the ten-year planning
period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2023.
Organization of the Housing Element
The Greenfield Housing element includes the following four sections plus appendices with additional
background and demographic data, which satisfy the requirements of State law and provide the
foundation for the development of goals, policies, implementation measures, and quantified objectives
for the planning period:
        1. Introduction. This section includes an overview, discussion of consistency of the element
         with state law, the public participation process, and consistency with the General Plan.
        2. Goals, Policies, and Implementation Programs. This section sets forth housing goals and
         outlines City goals, objectives, polices, and programs intended to address housing problems, the
         party responsible for implementation, and the program funding sources.
        3. Background/Setting. This section describes the City’s housing and demographic
         characteristics and conditions.
        4. Evaluation of Previous Housing Element. This section evaluates the City’s progress in
         achieving the goals and implementing the programs included in the 2010 Housing Element.
An appendix presents information on the housing needs assessment (population and household
characteristics, employment and economic trends, and housing stock data); projected housing needs
(estimates of new construction needs through 2023); site inventory/analysis (land suitable for
residential development, including vacant sites and sites having the potential for redevelopment); and
housing resources (ability to provide adequate residential opportunities and services for all segments of
the population).
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                           6-1

                                                                              6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Consistency with State Law
Each city in California must have a housing element in its General Plan (Government Code, Section
65000 et. seq.) The housing element must cover a 10-year time period and be revised every eight years,
based on the timeframes for the Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy. This
Housing Element is a revision of the City’s 2005-2010 Housing Element. The State Office of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) must review revisions to housing elements in accordance with state
housing element law.
Government Code, Section 65583 states that the housing element must consist of “identification and
analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives,
financial resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of
housing.” Specifically, the Housing Element must include the following:
        Analysis of population and employment trends and projections of existing and projected
         housing needs for all income levels, including the locality's share of the regional housing need.
        Analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including level of payment compared
         to ability to pay, housing characteristics including overcrowding, and housing condition.
        Inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having
         potential for redevelopment or reuse, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public
         facilities and services to these sites.
        The identification of a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use
         without a conditional use or other discretionary permit.
        Analysis of actual and potential governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement,
         or development of housing for all income levels, including land use controls, building codes and
         their enforcement, site improvement fees and other exactions required of developers, and local
         permit processing.
        Analysis of actual and potential non-governmental constraints, including the availability of
         financing, the price of land, and the cost of construction.
        Analysis of any special housing needs, such as those of the homeless, disabled, elderly, large
         families, female heads of households, and agricultural workers.
        Analysis of energy conservation opportunities with respect to residential development.
        An analysis of existing assisted housing developments that are eligible to change from low-
         income housing uses during the next 10 years due to termination of subsidy contracts,
         mortgage prepayment, or expiration of restrictions on use.
This Housing Element identifies and analyzes all items above. This Housing Element also identifies
existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial
resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
Public Participation
State law requires that during the preparation or amendment of the General Plan, the planning agency
provide opportunities for the involvement of citizens, public agencies, public utility companies, and
civic, educational, and other community groups through hearing and any other means the County or
City deems appropriate (Government Code Section 65351). In accordance with State law, during the
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                             6-2

                                                                            6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
development of the 2014-2023 Housing Element, the City encouraged the participation of all economic
segments of the community; especially lower income and special needs households.
In accordance with State law requirements, the City held a publicly noticed workshop before the
Greenfield City Council on December 8, 2015. The workshop was announced through the City Council
agenda notice and by inclusion of an announcement, in English and Spanish, inserted in utility bills to
ensure notice was received by each residence in the City and to encourage broad and comprehensive
citizen involvement in the refinement of the updated Housing Element.
The workshop information was presented in simple but accurate terms. Ample opportunity was given
for questions and comments from attendees. The City Council chambers in which the workshop was
presented was easily accessible for persons with disabilities. The City Council meeting at which the
housing element workshop was scheduled was heavily attended. An earlier item on the agenda was
very controversial, and the entire Council chambers were full prior to the housing element workshop
(about 200 persons), with additional persons waiting outside the chambers. Although many of these
people stayed for later agenda items, including the housing element workshop, enough departed the
council chambers prior to the housing element workshop that seating was readily available. Following
presentation of the Housing Element update, three members of the public spoke regarding the Housing
Element. An additional policy and several additional programs were added to the Housing Element in
response to comments.
The City’s overarching goal in updating the Housing Element was to create a document that
constructively addresses the vision, the goals, and the concerns of the entire community. In order to
achieve this goal, the City has included in this document realistic and achievable goals, policies that the
City is committed to using consistently, implementation programs and measures that are designed to
achieve the community’s goals, and a realistic timeline for completion.
Consistency with other General Plan Elements
The Housing Element is one of seven General Plan elements required under State Planning law. The
City’s General Plan was adopted in 2005. The previous Housing Element was adopted by the City
Council in 2012.
The elements of the General Plan must be fully integrated and must relate to each other without conflict.
Internal consistency applies to figures, diagrams, and General Plan text. It also applies to data, analysis,
and policies. All adopted portions of the General Plan, whether or not required by state law, have equal
legal weight; none may supersede another. The General Plan must resolve any potential conflicts among
the provisions of each element.
The Housing Element has been updated to be consistent with the other six required General Plan
elements, which include: Land Use, Circulation, Conservation, Open Space, Noise, and Safety. Findings
for consistency with these elements are as follows:
LAND USE ELEMENT
The Land Use Element is the section of the General Plan that describes where different types of
development should occur and at what intensity. It also includes maps of general land use designations.
The land use designations provide for the type and character of development permitted in each
designation, but without the specificity found in the zoning ordinance. Goals, objectives, and policies
provide the outline for orderly growth in the community.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                            6-3

                                                                            6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Four General Plan land use designations provide for residential housing development in Greenfield.
These designations are residential estate, low density residential, medium density residential, and high
density infill. Most of Greenfield is designated for residential use, the majority being low density
residential. This land use designation anticipates one residential unit on each lot with densities ranging
from 1 to 7 units per gross acre. The medium density residential designation permits duplexes,
apartments, condominiums, and mobile home parks. Densities in the range of 1 to 15 units per gross
acre are allowed. High-density infill provides for density of 10 to 21 units per gross acre. Currently no
land is designated “residential estate” (maximum of 2 units per acre). Residential uses are also allowed
when the Mixed Use Overlay is applied to a non-residential district.
The Housing Element is consistent with the land use element in that it utilizes the land use diagram
(there are no discrepancies) in providing logical areas for growth and development of all types and
densities of housing. The residential land uses identified in the Housing Element are consistent with the
Land Use Element land use categories, densities, and related land uses, such as parks and recreation
facilities. Any changes in land use to accommodate the City’s regional housing share would require a
General Plan Amendment and zoning change to ensure continued consistency. The Housing Element is
not proposing any changes in land use that differ from those depicted in Figure 2-3, Land Use Diagram.
CIRCULATION ELEMENT
The residential development required to meet the City’s regional share of housing would be distributed
throughout the City and would be accommodated by the City’s existing and planned circulation
infrastructure. New development would construct local street improvements, including improvements
to arterial and collector streets adjacent new development. Circulation impacts anticipated from
residential development in the City have been mitigated through planned improvements identified in
the Circulation Element. Residential development would not cause local traffic to exceed Level-of-
Service (LOS) objectives stated in the Circulation Element. The Housing Element is therefore consistent
with the Circulation Element.
CONSERVATION
The Housing Element does not call for development of housing on any lands designated for
conservation. All proposed residential development included in the Housing Element would be
consistent with the Conservation Element.
OPEN SPACE
The Housing Element does not call for development of housing on any lands designated for open space.
All proposed residential development included in the Housing Element would be consistent with the
Open Space Element.
NOISE ELEMENT
Noise Element analysis is based on the land uses identified in the 2005 General Plan, including the
residential development identified in the Housing Element. Some areas designated for residential
development are located in places that could potentially have noise levels in excess of the City’s adopted
standards for residential noise exposure. The Noise Element includes mitigation measures that will
reduce any potential impacts resulting from housing development to a less than significant level. The
Housing Element is consistent with the Noise Element.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                           6-4

                                                                           6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
SAFETY ELEMENT
The Housing Element is consistent with the Safety Element. No lands within Greenfield are within a
100-year floodplain or in an area of high hazard for wildfires; thus, no changes to the Housing Element
are required under Government Code Section 65302 (Chapter 369, Statutes 207-AB 162). Mitigation
measures have been identified that would reduce potential impacts from housing development on any
site with unstable soils to a less than significant level
.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                        6-5

                                                                           6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
2. GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
This section of the Housing Element presents the City’s policies and programs addressing housing needs
and affordability of housing within the City. For each program listed, notations are made to indicate
responsible parties, timeframes, and potential funding sources. The following notations are used:
          Implementation Timeframes                                 Responsible Parties
GP               addressed in General Plan           CD              Community Development
MC               addressed in Municipal Code         PW              Public Works/Engineering

YEAR             programmed for identified year      LS              Life Safety (Police and Fire)
Potential funding sources are shown in parentheses. Additional funding sources may become available
in the future, and the City will utilize the best funding source available for each program at time of
implementation.
The City has established eight housing goals. The housing goals are designed to address housing issues
that have been identified as relevant to the City. For each housing goal, the City has established an
objective and several polices and implementing programs. The City’s housing goals are:
Goal 6.1         Housing sites for all income levels
Goal 6.2         Adequate affordable housing
Goal 6.3         Fair housing opportunity available to all
Goal 6.4         Housing for persons with special needs
Goal 6.5         Engagement with other agencies and organizations in the provision of housing
Goal 6.6         Adequate infrastructure and services to support housing
Goal 6.7         Reduced ongoing household costs and supporting incomes
Goal 6.8         Well maintained housing stock and neighborhoods

3. BACKGROUND/SETTING
Income Characteristics
HOUSEHOLD INCOME LEVELS
State law requires that the Housing Element identify housing needs for all income groups. “Households”
are established residences, while “housing units” may be occupied only during portions of the year. For
purposes of federal, state, and local housing assistance programs, it is also important to identify
households according to extremely low, very low, low, or moderate income ranges. The State of
California definitions of household income levels are provided below in Table 1, Household Income
Levels.
                                 Table 1: Household Income Levels
 Household Income Category                                               Definition
 Extremely Low                        Incomes at or below 30 percent of area-wide median income
 Very Low                             Incomes between 31-50 percent of area-wide median income
 Low                                  Incomes between 51-80 percent of area-wide median income
 Moderate                             Incomes between 81-120 percent of area-wide median income
 Above Moderate                       Incomes above 120 percent of area-wide median income

*Percent of 2013 county median income of $59,168
In 2000 Greenfield was considered a “low income” residential area with a household median income of
$37,600, or 78 percent of Monterey County’s household median income. Average household size in
2000 was 4.72 persons. Greenfield’s 2013 household median income was $53,805, or 91 percent of the
County’s household median income of $59,168. However, Greenfield’s average household size is 44
percent larger than the County’s, with 4.54 persons, while Monterey County’s average household size is
3.15 persons. Thus; the corresponding adjusted household income is $36,525 which is only 63 percent
of the County’s median household income. Therefore, Greenfield can still be considered a “low income”
residential area. Adjusted Greenfield household income distribution is shown in Table 3, 2013

HOUSING NEEDS BY INCOME LEVELS
The Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG) is the regional Council of Government
that represents Greenfield and other neighboring communities in the Monterey Bay area. AMBAG’s
Regional Housing Needs Allocation Plan (RHNA) is part of the statewide mandate to address housing
issues that are related to future growth in the AMBAG region by determining existing and needed
allocations of regional affordable housing. The State of California provides population estimates to each
regional government in the State and the regional government then allocates estimated housing units
needed among member communities. AMBAG developed the RHNA for its member communities and, in
June 2014, the AMBAG Board of Directors adopted the final numbers and sent those numbers to HCD
for review. The estimated number of housing units needed as determined by AMBAG reflect the
planning period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2023.
The fundamental goal of RHNA is to assure a fair distribution of housing among cities and counties, so
that every community provides an opportunity for a mix of housing that is affordable and available to all
economic segments of the community. To develop allocations, AMBAG used current regional
distributions of very low, low, moderate, and above moderate household needs.
The housing allocation targets are not building requirements, but goals for each community to
accommodate housing through appropriate planning policies and land use regulations. Allocation
targets are intended to assure that adequate sites with appropriate zoning are made available to
address anticipated housing demand during the RHNA planning period, and that market forces are not
inhibited in addressing the housing needs of all economic segments of a community.
Table 4, Regional Housing Needs Allocations 2014-2023, illustrates the 2014-2023 housing unit
allocation for each of the four household income groups (e.g. very low, low, moderate, above moderate)
as adopted by AMBAG, for the Monterey County region and the City of Greenfield..

GREENFIELD’S PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS BASED ON INCOME
Projected housing needs are the total additional housing units required to house a jurisdiction’s
projected population by 2023 that are affordable to each income level, in standard condition, and not
overcrowded. The definitions of income used in the AMBAG plan reflect the income definitions used by
the State of California previously discussed. Projected housing needs include those of the existing
population as well as the needs of the additional population expected to reside in the community
through 2023. According to the AMBAG estimates, Greenfield has a need of 363 new housing units for
the planning period of 2014-2023. This estimate was developed by AMBAG based on various factors
including projected population, job growth, land availability, vacancy rates, and replacement housing
needs. Given AMBAG’s projected construction for the City of Greenfield of 363 units, Greenfield must
construct approximately 45 housing units per year.
After determining the number of additional housing units expected by the end of the planning period,
AMBAG further quantified future housing needs by income level in order to effectively distribute lower
income households equitably throughout a region. As previously discussed, this serves to avoid undue
concentrations of very low and low income households in one jurisdiction.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                        6-24

For Greenfield, the AMBAG goal is that 87 new housing units (24 percent of all new units) will be very
low income and 57 new housing units (16 percent of all new units) will be low income. The remaining
219 housing units were allocated to moderate or above moderate-income households.
To avoid further concentration of development in one area, AMBAG allocated a construction goal of 40
percent of the overall housing units for Greenfield to be dedicated to very low and low income
households for the 2014-2023 RHNA period. Therefore, through 2023, the City must assure that
adequate sites and zoning are made available to meet these targeted allocations for each of the
respective income groups.
The approved and pending residential developments identified in Table 6, Approved/Pending Housing
Projects in Greenfield since January 1, 2014 will provide102 housing units. All of the units are expected
to develop within the planning period, and will therefore contribute toward meeting the total
allocations determined as necessary by AMBAG and the City.

Three development projects (Cambria Park, Terracina Oaks, and Magnolia Place) and two individual
homes have been permitted, and partially constructed, since January 1, 2014.
CHISPA purchased the Cambria Park Subdivision from a private developer who intended to develop
market rate units. Under CHISPA, Cambria Park will provide housing for low income families. The
project consists of 39 total units, six of which were constructed in the prior planning period. CHISPA has
built or pulled permits for 20 additional units during the current planning period.
Phase II of the Terracina Oaks project will have a total of 48 units with eight units for extremely low
income, 31 units for very low income, and eight units for low income.
Magnolia Park is an 80-unit senior project in the western portion of Greenfield. Phase I has been
constructed with four very low income units and 28 low income units.
More than half of the City’s very low and low income housing target has been accomplished to date. The
City has suitably located and zoned undeveloped sites to accommodate development of dwelling units
suitable for all income groups sufficient to meet remaining units from AMBAG’s 363-unit target for the
planning period. Existing vacant residential sites within the City, and the sites available for residential
construction within existing zoning, provide adequate sites (see Background Report for site inventory).
Site availability will not prevent construction of sufficient units by 2023 to meet AMBAG’s targets;
however, rising construction and housing costs infuses some uncertainty into the anticipated
construction of the subject housing units. Sites exist but economic resources may not.

Housing Costs
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
One of the most important factors in evaluating a community’s housing market is the cost of housing
and whether it is affordable to current residents and those who would like to live in the community. In
the mid-2000s there was a downturn in the residential housing market. However, costs are now on the
rise again and Monterey County is still considered one of the least affordable places to live in the United
States. According to the California Association of Realtors, home affordability in Monterey County hit
record lows in 2014 with only 27 percent of homes being considered affordable based on median
income.
According to Realtytrac.com, as of July 2014 the City of Greenfield had an estimated 25 pre-foreclosures
(Notice of Defaults), trustee’s sales (Auction Homes) and bank owned (REO) properties down from over
300 in 2009. Due to the recent decline in foreclosures, Greenfield median home sales prices have not
driven up affordability factors like they had in previous years. With recent median home sales prices
increasing in Greenfield the market for moderate income first-time homebuyers has decreased.
HOMEOWNERSHIP COSTS
The 2013 U.S. Census data reported a median value of $166,300 for owner occupied units in Greenfield,
as shown in Table 7, Owner Occupied Housing Units by Value in 2013. This figure was based on values
of 1,673 owner occupied units. Units valued at less than $50,000 totaled 83 and units valued at
$500,000 or greater totaled 46. The vast majority of units, 1,202, representing approximately 72
percent, were valued between $100,000 and $299,999. However, the real estate market in most
California communities has slowed since the 2013 census information was obtained and non-distressed
sales have dropped for the first time since 2005 and median housing prices are rising.

According to the California Association of Realtors, July 2015 median home sales prices in Monterey

$445,000. According to Zillow, the average median home price in Greenfield was $226,600 in July of
2015, up 18.8 percent from the prior year.
With recent median home sales prices increasing in Greenfield and the larger Monterey County area, the
market for moderate income first-time homebuyers has decreased. According to a Mark Bruno report,
home sales have declined by over fifty percent in the last year. The recent rise in median home sales
prices may prevent many low and moderate income households to purchase single family residences
and/or condominiums as first-time homebuyers. There are few single-family residences and/or
condominiums listed below the median $226,600 price level on the open market. However, in recent
years mortgage interest rates have been historically low averaging approximately four percent. With
additional subsidies such as down payment assistance, low and very-low income households would
have more opportunity to purchase single-family residences and/or condominiums for the first time.
Prior to 2007, local housing costs and the lack of housing supply significantly restricted the ability for
very low, low, and moderate income households to enter the local housing market. There has been a
recent similar upturn in the housing market that is driving home prices up and affordability down.
In 2013, owner occupied housing represented 1,673 units, or about 48.7 percent, of all housing units in
2013. Of these units, 1,390 or about 83 percent were mortgaged. The median cost for owner occupied
housing with a mortgage was $1,500 and about 86.9 percent of owners with mortgages paid monthly
costs of $1,000 or more per month.
RENTAL COSTS
Greenfield’s housing stock in 2013 included 1,761 renter occupied units. The median rent in 2013 was
$1,141. About 2.3 percent of all renters paid the maximum rental price in Greenfield of $2,000 or more
per month. Over 55 percent of all renters paid between $1,000 and $1,999 per month. Table 8,

    2. Rents are calculated based on California HCD income limits:
         a. Very Low Income: 30% of 50% of area-wide median income, adjusted for household size.
         b. Low Income: 30% of 60% of area-wide median income, adjusted for household size. C.
         Moderate Income: 30% of 110% of area-wide median income, adjusted for household size.
    3. Sale Prices are calculated based on California HCD income limits:
         a. Low Income: 30% of 70% of area-wide median income, adjusted for household size.
         b. Moderate Income: 35% of 110% of area-wide median income, adjusted for household size.
    4. Sales Prices are calculated using the following loan terms: 7% interest rate, 30 year term, 10% down
    payment, 1.8% allowance for taxes, HOA dues, and insurance.
OVERPAYMENT
Approximately 38 percent of homeowners and 52 percent of renters in Greenfield were paying more
than 30 percent of their household incomes for housing. As the price of housing increases, a greater
segment of the population will either no longer be able to afford market-rate housing or will spend a
greater percentage of household income to secure housing. This is undoubtedly a factor in the high
household sizes seen in Greenfield, as people crowd into units or rent spare rooms to cut housing costs.
Table 9, Greenfield Housing Costs by Percentage of Household Income, illustrates overpayment for
housing by household income.

The data generally demonstrates a strong correlation between households with low incomes and
overpayment. In the income categories of less than $49,999, over 45 percent of renter occupied
households are overpaying with 30 percent or more of income going toward housing. In contrast, in the
$75,000 and over income category, no renter occupied units and only 3.8 percent of owner occupied
units are overpaying at the 30 percent rate. It must be further noted, that the foreclosures principally
involve populations overpaying for housing units; units that artificially were overvalued.
JOB-BASED HOUSING NEED
Greenfield’s jobs/housing balance, based on jobs and housing units in 2010, was 3.7 housing units per
job. For the tri-county region the ratio was 4.5 housing units per job. This data indicates that most
Greenfield residents are employed outside the community. In order to achieve a better jobs/housing
balance, Greenfield must generate additional employment opportunities within the community. There
are many advantages to a good jobs/housing balance, resulting from a balance between housing
opportunities and employment opportunities within a community. When residents work near their
homes, commuting time decreases while time for family, leisure pursuits, and community activities
increases. A better jobs/housing balance also encourages purchasing from local businesses rather than
those located at the place of employment or on the commute. This increases both local business and
local government revenues. In addition, providing additional jobs benefits the regional transportation
system by reducing the number of trips generated by residents commuting to jobs outside Greenfield.
AMBAG projects employment and population growth for Monterey and San Benito Counties in its
Regional Forecasts. Released in 2014, the AMBAG Regional Forecast projects significant population
growth, from 16,330 in 2010 to 22,061 in 2025, a 35 percent increase, while employment is estimated
to decrease to 51 jobs per 1000 people in 2025, down from 54 jobs per 1000 people in 2010. Housing
unit growth is expected to increase by 27.8 percent or 1,043 units by 2025. Despite the decrease in
housing units per job, the projected jobs/housing balance by 2025 is estimated to improve to 1.2 based
on AMBAG’s Regional Forecast. Table 10, AMBAG Regional Forecast for Greenfield, shows the estimated
Greenfield jobs-based housing demand by monthly housing payment. Although AMBAG predicts a
significant improvement in the jobs/housing ratio by 2025, 1.2 is still below the appropriate
jobs/housing ratio of 1.5 jobs per household. In order to improve Greenfield’s jobs/housing balance to
meet this ratio, Greenfield must generate additional employment opportunities within the community.

HOUSING UNITS
In 2013, there were 3,632 dwelling units in Greenfield. This represents a 22.5 percent increase since
2000 when there were a total of 2,726 housing units. Despite the increase in the number of housing
units, persons per dwelling unit increased slightly from 4.62 persons per unit in 2000 to 4.78 persons
per unit in 2013. Table 11, Population, Housing Units, and Persons per Unit, shows the changes in

The vacancy rate in a community indicates the percentage of units that are vacant and for sale or for
rent at any one time. Low vacancy rates (typically defined as anything less than 3 percent for
homeowner units and 5 percent or less for rental units) can indicate a tight housing market. This means
that with few vacant units, an exceptionally high demand is created for the vacant units.
Data from the 2015 California Department of Finance tables indicate Greenfield has an overall vacancy
rate of 7.8 percent up from 3 percent in 2009. The 2015 vacancy rates demonstrate that there may be a
trend towards increased availability of units in relation to demand in comparison to 2009’s extremely
tight housing market.
HOUSING CONDITION
One common indicator used to determine housing condition is the age of housing. As the data in the
Table 13, Year of Construction, indicates, approximately 55.3 percent of the City’s housing stock was
built since 1990. The last structural condition survey, which consisted of a visual inspection of the
exterior of all dwellings in Greenfield, was completed by the City was in 1994. The survey consisted of. A
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                              6-30

standardized point system supplied by HCD was used to assess the condition of each house, including
foundation, roofing, siding, windows, and doors. Each dwelling was rated as sound, minor need of
rehabilitation, moderate need of rehabilitation, substantial need of rehabilitation, or dilapidated
condition. The total number of units surveyed was 1,926. Of that number, 98.2 percent were sound or
were in need of only minor rehabilitation. Only 23 units, 1.2 percent, were in need of moderate or
substantial rehabilitation and only 11 units, 0.6 percent, were dilapidated. The Greenfield Building
Official, using the Uniform Building Code and Housing Code, made the final determination of condition.
In 2016, the City reassessed the anticipated condition of its housing stock by using this pre-existing data,
age of houses, and knowledge of the City’s neighborhoods, to estimate current housing conditions. Table
14, Housing Conditions, shows the distribution of the housing units by category of condition.

Approximately 55.3 percent of the City’s housing stock was built subsequent to 1990 and is 25 years of
age or less. During the decades from 1990 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2014, over 2,000 housing units
were constructed.
REHABILITATION OF EXISTING UNITS
Approximately 244.6 percent of Greenfield housing units are nearly30 years or older, the age at which
maintenance is critical if houses have not been maintained on a regular basis. Around 23.1 percent are
between 20 and 30 years old, a timeframe during which preventative maintenance should be occurring.
The City supports rehabilitation of these older units as required and will continue its code enforcement
efforts, as the City’s budget and available revenues allow, to see that needed repairs are completed. Past
rehabilitation efforts have generally been private-sector driven. The City has used grant funds (HOME

and CalHOME) for housing rehabilitation assistance to income-eligible households. To the extent such
grant funds are available in the future, the City will continue the use of such funding to meet its
rehabilitation goals.
HOUSEHOLD TENURE
Tenure distribution of a city’s housing stock influences the local housing market. Rental houses tend to
have a much higher frequency of turnover rates and overpayment than houses that are owner-occupied.
Greenfield currently has more renter occupied units than owner occupied units which may result in a
higher prevalence of overpayment. Greenfield must have sufficient number of houses for sale and for
rent to accommodate a comprehensive range of households of varying compositions.
In 1990, owner-occupied homes comprised 59.8 percent of households. That percentage remained
virtually unchanged from 1990 to 2000, increasing from 1,316 units in 1990 to 1,569 units in 2000.
From 2000 to 2013 the percentage of owner-occupied homes reduced by 10 percent. The percent of
households that were renter occupied units from 1990 to 2000 also remained constant at about 40
percent, with the percentage of units increasing from 2000-2013 to 51 percent. Thus, household tenure
has shifted over the past few years from more owner occupied units to more renter occupied units.
Based on housing projects approved and pending in the City the household tenure is likely to change
over the next five years. Table 15, Households by Tenure, compares housing tenure in the City of
Greenfield from 1990 to 2013.

Greenfield’s percentage of homeowner units was 48.7 percent, while the percentage of homeowner
occupied units in Monterey County was 49.7 percent. The rate for the State of California in 2013 was
55.3 percent of all households. This data would indicate that in comparison to County and State
averages Greenfield has a comparable home ownership occupancy rate and, correspondingly, a
comparable renter occupancy rate to Monterey County and that both the City and County are marginally
below the state percentage. However, home ownership in the City has dropped significantly since the
2000 Census.
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES
The Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act defines a disadvantaged community as consisting of a population with
a median household income less than 80 percent of the statewide annual median. A city annexing
territory adjacent to a disadvantaged community must also apply to annex the disadvantaged
community. No known disadvantaged communities exist within the City (unincorporated island) or
adjacent to the city limits.

Housing Constraints
GOVERNMENT HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Both economic forces in the private market and regulations and policies imposed by public agencies can
affect new housing development and housing affordability. Not only can these constraints impact the
production and affordability of new housing but they can also affect maintenance and improvement of
existing housing. It is the City’s policy to eliminate all potential and actual governmental constraints
upon the development of housing for all income levels and for persons with disabilities, including land
use controls required of developers, and local processing and permit procedures.
The purpose of governmental housing regulations and policies is to protect the quality and safety of
residential development in Greenfield. However, the cost of housing construction can be unintentionally
affected by such regulations and policies which consequently affects housing affordability. Among these
constraints are zoning regulations, land use controls, building codes, required site improvements,
permit fees, processing costs, and other impact fees and exactions required of developers. Zoning and
land use controls may limit density, require substantial setbacks and open space, or limit types of
allowable units. Building codes may dictate types of materials and construction techniques. Such
regulations may increase housing costs as developers pass on these additional development costs to
homebuyers.
In addition, on-site and off-site improvements, including road improvements, traffic signalization, sewer
improvements, project mitigation, and other related improvements that are required may increase a
project’s costs of development.
Land Use Controls
Greenfield’s development controls include policies and regulations contained in the City’s General Plan,
Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance, and Building Code. The City currently has no growth
management policies or regulations to constrain housing development. The City’s policies and
regulations have not restricted the development of affordable housing within the community. Section 2,
Goals Polices and Implementation Plans, provides specific programs that the City will utilize to evaluate
and address the current zoning ordinance provisions and other City requirements to determine if
amendments or adoption of new provisions could further the City’s affordable housing goals.
The City has adequate residential land available and has zoning classifications that provide for higher
density residential development. In addition, the City has adopted a mixed-use overlay that will allow
the construction of residential units within mixed-use development projects, providing another means
to achieve affordable housing within the community. In 2013 a Memorandum of Agreement was
approved that will allow for the City, County, and LAFCO to evaluate future annexation proposals
included in the March 2007 Sphere of Influence or in future amendments to the Greenfield Sphere of
Influence.
Greenfield’s development standards, design requirements, and fee schedules are reasonable and
comparable those of other Salinas Valley communities. These regulations and requirements do not
present significant constraints to the development of affordable housing in the community.
The General Plan
New Residential development must be consistent with the adopted General Plan’s policies which may
present constraints to development. Specifically, the Land Use Element of the General Plan describes
where and at what intensity different types of development can occur. The Land Use element also
provides general land use designations which allocate the type and character of development permitted
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                          6-33

in each designation, but without the level of specificity provided by the zoning ordinance. This Housing
Element is consistent with the land use element because it provides logical areas for growth and
development to all types and densities of housing.
Zoning Ordinance
The range of densities is shown in Table 16, Residential Densities by Zone. Most of the City’s residential
territory is zoned Single Family Residential (R-L). Currently no lands are zoned Residential Estate (R-E).
Most of downtown is included in a Mixed Use (MUO) overlay, as are two neighborhood commercial
areas in the western portion of the City. The Special High Density Residential Overlay (SHO) requires a
density of between 20 and 21 units per acre, and has been applied to the Clifton Court mobile home
park east of U.S. Highway 101. The Zoning Ordinance provides flexibility in development standards,
including staggering of front setbacks and lot coverage. See Table 23 and Table 24 in the Background
Report for further discussion of development standards. The City’s Zoning Ordinance allows
condominium units in all residential districts, with the requirement that certain standards are met.
Further the City’s Zoning Ordinance allows manufactured homes in all residential districts and in the
retail business (C-R) district if it is part of a mixed-use development. The “Planned Development”
(Municipal Code Section 17.16.080) permitting may be used in any zoning district through the specified
application and approval process. Although density cannot exceed that of the underlying zone, the
Planned Development permit has no pre-set site standards and can therefore be used for creative
project designs. No land within the City is zoned for agricultural use – the City only annexes land that is
intended for urban development.

Design Review
Most new development projects, including single-family and multi-family residential projects, require
design review before the Planning Commission. Design review encompasses the review of dwelling
design, color, landscaping, and other exterior treatments, and is intended, in part, to ensure
compatibility between adjacent uses and to help prevent the depreciation of land values by ensuring
proper attention is given to site and architectural design.
Design Standards for Residential Districts
Currently, development standards for multi-family residential districts allow significant design
flexibility to encourage a broad range of housing types and are intended to ensure compatibility and

connectivity with surrounding neighborhoods and uses. Areas zoned for residential estates, single
family residential, and multi-family residential uses must adhere to design standards for density,
building heights, minimum parcel sizes, etc.
Off-site Improvements
According to Greenfield Municipal Code Section 16.36.010, “all improvements shall conform to the City’s
Standard Details and Specifications as adopted by the city council. Any deviations shall be only with the
written approval of the city council. Permits shall be obtained from the city engineer, where required,
before any construction is started.”
Development Fees
The development of new housing units imposes certain costs upon local government, such as the cost of
providing planning services and inspections. In addition, there are long-term costs such as the
continued maintenance of a community’s infrastructure and public facilities. In order to pay for such
services, local governments charge fees for proposed development applications. Fees charged by the
City of Greenfield for common planning and development applications are listed in Table 24 and Table
25 in the Background Report. Historically, Greenfield Planning Department fees were the lowest of any
city in the Salinas Valley. Costs for particular projects vary depending on the type of approvals required..
As a preliminary step in the development of housing, the fees add directly or indirectly to housing costs.
The City Council adopted a new fee schedule, which increased some of the City’s fees, in December 2014
(effective February 2015). In addition to these development fees, the City charges fees associated with
obtaining building permits, which are typically calculated based on the type of occupancy and the
number of square feet of construction.
Subdivision Regulations
Title 16 of the Greenfield Municipal Code governs procedures for subdividing land, dedication of public
facilities (parks and school sites), and the design of streets, utilities, lots and improvements. New lots
must be at least 6,000 square feet and 60 feet in width. However, the ordinance contains a procedure
that allows variance from minimum lot requirements in special circumstances.
The City's requirement for residential street width is 68 feet. The street pavement is 40 feet wide with
four-foot wide bicycle lanes and a 10-foot easement area on each side. Arterial streets require two-way
left turn lanes, also resulting in wider streets. Although wide streets add off-site improvement cost to
projects, the increased safety makes such costs acceptable.
Building Codes
New construction must meet all state mandated building codes which can add substantially to the cost
of development. These include the California Building Code, related trade codes, the California Energy
Code, Title 24 regulations, and State seismic safety requirements. These codes and regulations are used
in jurisdictions throughout California. The state mandates that these building, mechanical, plumbing,
fire, housing, and historical building codes must be complied with in all construction. Local agencies
may enact stricter requirements, but may not be less restrictive that the state codes. Chapter 15.04 of
the Greenfield Municipal Code adopted the 2007 state building codes. Greenfield is currently in the
process of putting together an amendment adopting the most recent building code. No local
amendments have been adopted.
These codes and regulations are enforced through the development review process and through review
of existing housing conditions by the Building Inspector. The Building Inspector reviews all building
plans for new development to ensure compliance with the California Building Code. If unsafe conditions

                                                                                 6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
are discovered or suspected, a correction notice is filed under the authority of the California Building
Code for the abatement of dangerous structures. The Building Inspector or the Planning Director also
responds to complaints filed by citizens regarding housing violations.
Regional and County Government Approval
Development upon land surrounding a city is subject to regional governmental approval. State, regional,
and local agency policies regarding the conversion of agricultural land, groundwater overdraft, and
ambient air quality degradation may result in constraints to the provision of additional housing units.
However, these constraints are consistent with other areas of Monterey County and within California.
Monterey County LAFCO has the ultimate decision-making authority regarding annexations to the City
of Greenfield. LAFCO policies are intended to ensure that growth occurs in an orderly and planned
manner, discourage urban sprawl, and protect surrounding agricultural lands. LAFCO also reviews and
approves spheres of influence for cities. The adopted sphere of influence for Greenfield designates
several areas to the west and east of the City as suitable for future urban development. Most of these
areas are currently designated for residential uses within Greenfield's General Plan. One industrial site
of approximately 20 acres is in the current sphere of influence (designated as urban transition).
Monterey County Water Resources Agency
There is the possibility of the imposition of specific water conservation or allocation plans by the
Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA), given the County's drought and seawater
intrusion problems. Currently, MCWRA has no permit authority with regard to development projects in
incorporated cities. However, MCWRA does have jurisdiction over the use of groundwater within the
county and can impose a moratorium on development in all areas of the county, both unincorporated
and incorporated.
The MCWRA has influence over the approval of annexations to Greenfield, which require LAFCO
approval. Due to the County's current groundwater overdraft problem, one of LAFCO's prime objectives
is ensuring that potentially adverse groundwater impacts are offset through the implementation of
project conditions. By request of MCWRA, housing project approvals incorporate conditions that may
increase construction costs. These conditions include individual lot landscaping implemented by the
builder, rather than future lot owners, with lawn areas limited to 25 percent of each landscape area.
Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District (MBUAPCD)
Similar to the MCWRA, the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District has no permitting
authority over housing projects. However, the MBUAPCD has completed an air quality management
plan for the Monterey Bay Region (including Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Benito counties) identifying
various air pollution control measures based on forecasted population growth in the region. Population
increases generally occur with residential project construction. If growth exceeds forecasted population
numbers established by the air quality management plan, the district would anticipate an adverse
impact on air quality. Air quality concerns may limit the construction of new residential projects which
could result in limited affordable housing.
MARKET CONSTRAINTS
There are a number of costs involved in the development of housing. These include land and
construction costs, site improvements (streets, sidewalks, etc.), sales and marketing, financing, and
profit. Because these costs are so market sensitive, it is difficult for local government to reduce them.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                            6-36

Non-governmental building constraints do not appear overwhelming to potential housing development
in Greenfield. The land purchase and development costs and housing construction costs in Greenfield
are similar to those in other southern Monterey County cities, and much less than the northern portions
of the county. This section evaluates both governmental and non-governmental constraints that have
the potential to affect the Greenfield housing market.
Interest Rates
Since most homes are purchased with a relatively small percentage of cash down payment, the cost of
borrowing money to buy a home is a major factor affecting the cost of housing and overall housing
affordability. The higher the interest rate and other financing costs charged for borrowing money to
purchase a home, the higher the total cost of the home and the higher the household income required to
pay that cost. Home mortgage interest rates have been between 3.5 and 5.0 percent since 2009. Credit
had been very difficult to obtain, but this has normalized in recent years.
The effect of financing costs on housing costs is demonstrated by showing how monthly mortgage
payments (principal and interest) on a 30-year $200,000 loan, increase with higher interest rates. At an
interest rate of four percent, monthly payments would be $955 , requiring an income of about $54,571.
At an interest rate 5 percent, monthly payments would be $1,074, requiring an income of about
$61,360. At an interest rate of 6 percent, monthly payments would be $1,199, requiring an income of
about $68,520.
Land Costs
According to the California Building Industry Association, the cost of land represents an ever-increasing
proportion of the total housing development cost, although it has much less impact on the maintenance
and improvement of existing stock. The cost of land will vary significantly depending on whether it has
entitlements, graded or finished lots, or utilities installed. Raw un-entitled land will be less expensive in
recognition of the costs and risks of achieving entitlements.
According to a 2014 report on affordable housing costs prepared by HCD, land cost accounted for about
eight percent of the cost of affordable housing. Based on an analysis of the 251 projects, land costs
varied considerably on a cost per acre basis. The median land cost in 2012 dollars for these projects was
approximately $400,000 per acre. However, the average cost per acre was approximately $1,000,000
per acre, indicating that a few properties were very expensive, but most properties were less expensive.
Approximately 27 percent of studied projects had land costs under $200,000 per acre. Specific
geographical data on these land costs was not presented in the report, but many of the studied projects
were located in the Bay Area and Los Angeles, where land costs are considerably higher than in
Greenfield. A pro forma prepared in 2010 for the Magnolia Place Senior Apartments project, cited a land
cost of $600,000 for a 1.9-acre site.
Construction Costs
High construction costs influence market rate housing costs and impact the production of affordable
housing. The International Code Council provides a per-square-foot estimate of $119.73 for single-
family residential construction and $107.72 for multi-family construction, but these are national
averages for permit valuation purposes, and costs in California would be significantly higher. A tax
credit application prepared in 2014 for the Magnolia Place Senior Apartments project cited a
construction cost of $154 per square foot.

Housing Opportunities
RESIDENTIAL BUILD-OUT UNDER THE GENERAL PLAN
Table 2-7 in the Land Use Element shows the total potential for development of residential uses within
the City’s planning area, assuming development of all parcels at maximum density, is 10,717 units. Site-
specific constraints, market factors, and development inefficiencies, actual development is likely to be
considerably less than these potential build-out numbers.
Since most residential development of five or more lots is subject to the City’s inclusionary housing
requirement, these developments will result in the creation of a combination of market rate and
affordable housing units. In addition, the General Plan provides for a Mixed Use Development
designation, in which the same site could be used for both commercial and residential uses, at a ratio of
up to one residential unit per 3,000 square feet of commercial space. A fiscal report prepared for the
proposed Walnut Avenue Specific Plan in 2010 identified about 225,000 square feet of commercial uses
within the El Camino Real core area, which could result in approximately 75 residential units.
CONVERSION OF INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIALLY DESIGNATED LAND FOR RESIDENTIAL USE
There are over 200 acres of undeveloped land designated for either industrial or commercial use within
the City. These land use designations and their corresponding zoning classifications do not permit
residential use.

The establishment of a viable Sphere of Influence is critical for promoting logical and cost effective
annexation for new residential development and economic development in Greenfield. The City adopted
its new General Plan in 2005 and amended its Sphere of Influence. In 2007, LAFCO acted to officially
expand the City’s Sphere of Influence by 820 acres. However, there was no prior City-County Sphere of
Influence agreement which left numerous unsettled issues between Monterey County and the City of
Greenfield. Adoption of a Memorandum of Agreement addressing these issues became a condition of
approval by LAFCO for the adoption of a new City Sphere of Influence to allow properties within the
pre-2007 Sphere of Influence area to annex prior to formalization of the Memorandum of Agreement.
In 2013 the Memorandum of Agreement was approved to allow for the City, County, and LAFCO to
evaluate future annexation proposals included in the March 2007 Sphere of Influence or in future
amendments to the Greenfield Sphere of Influence. This will allow Greenfield to provide adequate land
for residential development. The Memorandum of Agreement serves to satisfy the requirements
imposed on the City which requires the City and LAFCO to enter into an agreement prior to any
annexation to the City on 10 issues including: long term direction of growth, urban development
patterns, and regional housing needs.
ALTERNATE FINANCING AND HOMEBUYER ASSISTANCE
Alternative residential financing methods are available, such as the USDA Rural Housing Service (RHS)
loan program, available to rural areas showing need for low income housing (generally communities
with populations less than 35,000 that are designated as non-metropolitan or are non-contiguous to
metropolitan areas). Greenfield addresses are eligible for both single-family and multiple-family
housing under this program. Low income applicants are eligible for interest assistance (write downs)
under the same general conditions as the CHISPA programs. Housing loans may also be available to
applicants not exceeding the County median income levels. RHS allows loans of up to 100 percent of
present market value of a dwelling, including the site, or 100 percent of the acquisition costs, whichever
is less. The low income level for a family of four is set at $30,400, with the moderate income level set at
$38,000.

The California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) offers a wide variety of programs to assist developers
and first time homebuyers. Opportunities include financing assistance ranging from to 90 percent
assistance to developers (depending on project characteristics and the market: single family and multi-
family); first time buyer programs for single-family homes; and mortgage assistance programs. These
projects depend on a partnership with land developers or housing agencies, creating involvement and
financing assistance from the beginning of a project. Loan and mortgage assistance developed in
cooperation with Federal Housing Assistance programs include:
         Home Purchase Assistance Program (HPA)
         Home Mortgage Purchase Program (HMP)
         Matching Down Payment Program
         Self- Help Housing Program
         Rental Housing Programs
According to the Department of Finance, the 2015 population of Greenfield is 16,870 residents. Forty-
five percent of the households in Greenfield are currently considered low income households. Table 17,
Maximum Household Income Levels, below provides the 2014 maximum household income limits for
eligibility for state housing assistance programs for communities in Monterey County. Affordability of
the units is based on the income level of the renter/buyer. The renter’s/buyer’s income cannot exceed
the low-income level set by the USDA, which varies depending upon family size. All units built by non-
profit developers who received subsidies through tax credits, etc. are required to enter into a 55-year
affordability conveyance. This means that income levels and deed restrictions must be verified before a
home can be sold.

DENSITY BONUSES/INCENTIVES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS
According to AB 1866, SB 1818, AB 2222, and amended sections of the State Government Code, a
density bonus (or equivalent financial incentives) of up to 35 percent must be granted to housing
developers who agree to construct a specified minimum percentage of the units affordable to lower
income households. The City of Greenfield has adopted a separate affordable housing ordinance section
17.51 which requires that “all residential development consisting of five (5) or more units or lots in the
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                          6-39

                                                                            6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
city shall provide inclusionary units on site. The city’s density bonus ordinance shall be applicable to
proposed projects which conform to the density bonus ordinance requirements. Multifamily projects
designed as rental projects shall require a set-aside of twenty percent (20%) of the units as inclusionary
rental units. Traditional subdivision projects shall require a set aside of twenty percent (20%) of the
units as for-sale inclusionary units. Both mixed-use projects and projects of mixed housing type shall
require a set-aside of twenty percent (20%) of the units included in the development as inclusionary
units; however, the number and type of rental inclusionary units and for-sale inclusionary units shall be
determined on a case-by-case basis and set forth in the affordable housing agreement.” According to
Section 17.51.080 a developer of a residential development containing five or more units may elect to
pay a fee (20 percent of the cost of developing the average market rate unit proposed multiplied by the
number of inclusionary units for which the fee is being paid) in-lieu of providing a required inclusionary
unit only if the twenty percent obligation results in a fractional unit and only as to that fractional unit.
The City’s affordable housing provisions do not yet reflect the latest revisions to State law, and the City
will amend its zoning code for conformity to State law.
NON-PROFIT HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS
The City currently has partnerships with Community Housing Improvement Systems and Planning
Association (CHISPA), Pacific West Communities, and the Housing Authority of Monterey County to
develop low-income units.
After the last Housing Element update, the City was required to commit twenty percent of its increment
revenue to the provision of affordable housing. In 2005, the City instituted two programs using RDA
funds: a First-Time Homebuyer Down Payment Assistance Program (FTHB) and a grant program to pay
up to $3,000 of closing costs for households that are income-eligible. The FTHB program provided a
deferred 30-year loan of up to $50,000 to assist income-eligible households with the purchase of a
residential unit.
CHISPA has constructed over 331 affordable housing units in the City since 1991, and has assumed
development of the Cambria Park subdivision, which will include 39 low income units at completion. .
Pacific West Communities, another non-profit housing developer, utilized housing tax credits to
construct 48 multi-family residential units (Terracina Oaks) for low and very low income households
and a 32 unit senior complex (Magnolia Place Senior Apartments) also for low and very low income
households. Planning will also soon begin for a second phase to the Magnolia Place Senior Apartments
project.
In addition, the Housing Authority of Monterey County maintains 25 units of affordable housing in the
City. The Housing Authority purchased an adjacent 2.43-acre site from the City on which 28 units for
sale to very low and low income households is planned.
Other non-profit housing organizations in the area include:
        South County Housing, Gilroy, California
        Habitat for Humanity, Seaside, California
        Mid-Peninsula Housing Corporation, Foster City, California
Collaboration with additional organizations is discussed in greater detail in the Background Report’s
Support Services section.

COUNTY, STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS
The City will apply for county, state, and federal programs that would help meet the City’s identified
housing needs and objectives. Some of the specific programs which the City will explore are: the State’s
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG), Joe Serna Jr. Farmworker Housing Grant
Program (FWHG), Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME), CalHOME, and Multifamily Housing
Program (MHP), as well as U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Housing Service and U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development programs to finance low- and moderate income housing, and state
and federal programs aimed at providing housing and related services to homeless individuals. The City
is a current recipient of a CDBG grant that will be used to establish housing rehabilitation and
homebuyer assistance programs. Those programs will be implemented in 2016.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through its Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) program, provides funds for community development and housing, homebuyer
assistance, public facility and infrastructure improvements, among others. In 2015 the City was
awarded a $2 million CDBG grant that included housing rehabilitation and homebuyer assistance
programs. Beginning in 2016, the City has partnered with Monterey County and several other cities to
become entitlement cities whereby the City will receive an annual CDBG award on a non-competitive
basis. These future grant awards can be used for housing rehabilitation and other affordable housing
activities.
HOME Investment Partnership Act (HOME) Funds
The HOME investment Partnership Act is another HUD program that is designed to improve and
increase the supply of affordable housing. In 2002, the City was awarded $500,000 in HOME funds for
housing rehabilitation activities. In 2015, Pacific West Communities was awarded HOME funds in the
amount of $5,000,000.00 for a 48-unit multifamily housing complex for families at 60 percent or less of
the area’s median income (the second phase of the Terracina Oaks Apartments project).
CalHOME Funds
These funds provide grants to local public agencies and non-profit developers to assist individual
households through deferred payment loans and offers direct forgivable loans to assist development
projects involving multiple ownership units, including single-family subdivisions. The City was
previously awarded CalHOME funds that it used to partner with CHISPA for the construction of two
separate low and very low income multi-family residential projects.
Section 8 Rental Assistance
Section 8 Rental Assistance provides vouchers to very low-income and low income households in need
of affordable housing. This program, funded by HUD and administered by the County Housing
Authority, pays the difference between what the household can afford (i.e., 30 percent of household
income) and the Fair Market Rate (FMR) for the region. Vouchers are portable and may be used for any
rental unit that accepts them.

OTHER FUNDING SOURCES
Greenfield Redevelopment Agency
In the past, the City was able to utilize funds available through the Greenfield Redevelopment Agency for
the provision of affordable housing. The City previously instituted two programs using RDA funds: a
First Time Homebuyer Down Payment Assistance program (FTHB) and a grant program to pay up to
$3,000 of closing costs for households that are income-eligible. The FTHB program provided a deferred
30-year loan of up to $30,000 to assist income-eligible households with the purchase of a residential
unit. In 2011 the State Legislature directed all of the state’s RDAs be dissolved. In 2015, State legislation
was enacted that will allow cities and counties to create “community revitalization investment
authorities” and require a minimum of 25% of the revenues for these authorities to be used toward
affordable housing. At this time it is not known whether the City will be eligible to create such an
authority. The City will, however, continue to explore this potential opportunity for affordable housing
funds.
The following resources may also be available to the City or housing developers:
        California Housing Finance Agency financial assistance programs
        Federal/State Low-income Housing Tax Credits (see description of tax credit program in
         Appendix to this document)
        Federal Home Loan Bank, Affordable Housing Program
        Mortgage Credit Certificates
        HCD facilitates a clearinghouse for affordable housing finance information and resources.
         Information on additional resources for affordable housing can be accessed at the HCD web site,
         www.hcd.ca.gov/clearinghouse.
The Background Report provides a summary of federal, state, and local financial resources for housing.
CONSERVATION OF AFFORDABLE UNITS
Conservation and improvement of existing housing stock is beneficial to the city as it aids in maintaining
investment in the community and it keeps housing affordable. The City will continue to implement its
code enforcement activities and programs identified in the Background Report. These programs will
help to conserve affordable housing units.
ENERGY CONSERVATION
Energy conservation measures can help reduce a household’s overall housing costs. Weatherization, use
of solar energy, and the use of other “green” building methods can help increase efficiency and lower
energy consumption.
Greenfield cooperates with the local energy purveyor, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG & E), to make
available information on energy saving programs; retrofitting and weather stripping for older non-
insulated homes; and programs for low income individuals, including the elderly. Programs designed to
assist lower income households with weatherization, energy efficiency improvements, and assistance
with utility costs include the following programs:
        LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program),: Low-income households (less than
         60% of the State Median Income Level) qualify for financial assistance and free housing
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                             6-42

                                                                          6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
        renovations to offset their energy costs. Funded by the Department of Health and Human
        Services, the LIHEAP Block Grant provides two services, weatherization assistance and financial
        assistance.
             o   The Weatherization Program provides homes with free weatherization services to
                 conserve energy, including attic insulation, weather-stripping, minor housing
                 repairs, and related energy conservation measures.
             o   The Homes Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) provides financial assistance to pay
                 the energy bills. The average payment within the State of California is $182 per
                 household per year.
       REACH: Sponsored by Pacific Gas and Electric and administered by the Salvation Army, REACH
        provides energy assistance to low-income customers. Households that do not qualify for HEAP
        or another alternative assistance program may receive a one-time payment aid for energy costs.
        In the last 18 years, REACH has assisted 369,000 households in Northern California with more
        than $56 million in total aid.
       Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEM): Homebuyers that purchase energy efficient homes or
        renovate houses to conserve energy qualify for special mortgage benefits through EEMs.
        Determined by results from the Home Energy Rating System (HERS), home loans may include
        energy improvement costs reducing homeowner’s utility bills. The California Home Energy
        Efficient Rating System (CHEERS) is a local HERS and is supported by PG&E, lending
        institutions, and building associations.
       CARE Residential Single Family Program: provides a 20 percent discount to single-family low
        income customers who have their own accounts.
       CARE Sub-metered Tenant Program: provides a 20 percent discount to low-income tenants who
        are metered or billed by their landlord, including residents of mobile home parks, sub-metered
        apartments, and marinas.
       CARE for Qualified Nonprofit Group Living Facilities Program: provides a 20 percent discount to
        tax-exempt non-profit group living facilities serving low income groups such as homeless
        shelters, hospices, and domestic violence shelters.
       CARE for Qualified Agricultural Employee Housing Facilities Program: provides a 20 percent
        discount to privately owned and licensed employee housing, non-profit migrant housing, and
        migrant farmworker housing owned and operated by the State Office of Migrant Services (OMS).
       HERO Program operates under Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) legislations signed into
        law in 2008. This program allows property owners in participating cities and counties to
        finance renewable energy, water, and energy efficiency improvements on their property.
        Participation in this program is voluntary and participating property owners repay loan
        amounts through a voluntary property tax assessment. The City agreed to participate in this
        program in 2015.
In addition to the programs discussed above, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides
assistance to low-income seniors with weatherization needs.
In the course of development permit processing and environmental review, the City reviews proposed
projects for energy conservation and use of solar energy, encouraging energy conservation measures.

State Law requires findings relative to energy conservation in connection with major subdivisions. The
Building Department enforces the State Residential Energy Standards.
Fair Housing Opportunity
It is vital that housing is available for all sectors of the population regardless of race, color ethnicity,
national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, sex, disability, age, source of income, religion
or other factors.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development maintains records of all housing
discrimination complaints according to jurisdiction. From 2006-2011, 53 complaints were received by
HUD in Monterey County. Of these complaints, two were recorded from Greenfield. Both of the
complaints were related to discrimination based on a disability; one of which was dismissed for no
cause and the other was settled. Although the data indicates a low occurrence of discrimination based
on race, color ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, sex, disability, age,
source of income, religion or other factors within Greenfield, this could be attributed to underreporting
of discriminatory practices. Greenfield should provide adequate resources to help ensure fair housing
opportunities for all residents.
Housing for the Special Needs Population
Within each community, certain sub-populations that have special housing needs and frequently have a
more difficult time securing suitable affordable housing. The 2005 Greenfield Housing Element
identified the City’s need to provide equal access to housing for people with special needs. For purposes
of this Housing Element, the following are the households that have been identified as having special
housing needs:
         Homeless Households
         Single Parent Households
         Senior Headed Households
         Disabled Households (Physical and Mental)
         Farmworker Households
         Overcrowded and Large Households
This section will provide further detail on the housing needs of these groups, current services available,
and areas zoned to accommodate special housing. Table 18, Special Needs Groups, presents the number
and percentage of the 2013 population with special housing needs.
HOMELESSNESS
Homelessness is a housing issue that has become a significant social concern in recent years. Reasons
for homelessness are varied, including the rising cost of housing, the continuing decrease in federal
housing funds, the increase of mentally ill individuals living on their own, persons with substance abuse
problems, persons fleeing from domestic violence, lack of family support networks, and more.
Determining the number of homeless people in an area is a difficult task. On the state level, the number
of homeless people appears to have increased within the past decade. Correspondingly, available
sources indicate that the number of homeless people in Monterey County also increased within the past
decade.

A 2015 homeless census and survey, commissioned by Monterey County, found 2,308 homeless persons
in the county down from 2,590 homeless persons in 2013. This marked the first decrease in number of
documented homeless persons in a biennial enumeration. Table 19, Monterey County Homeless Survey
Demographics depicts overall Monterey County survey demographics for 2013 and 2015. The homeless
survey found that the City of Greenfield had a total homeless population of two, both of whom were un-

Prevention of homelessness is an important component of a comprehensive housing strategy. It is
estimated that it is three to six times less costly to prevent an incidence of homelessness than it is to
provide emergency shelter, transitional shelter, and services such as counseling.

Existing Services and Resources for Homeless Individuals and Households
According to the 2015 Monterey County Homeless Services Resource Guide, there are numerous
support services within Monterey County including emergency shelters, community kitchens,
transitional housing, rental support services, and ancillary services. Additionally, the Monterey County
Social Services Agency provides vouchers for elderly or homeless persons with disabilities to allow
limited local motel stays. Some local churches provide funds for emergency shelter in motels and people
requesting aid from the Salvation Army are given a free motel stay of up to two night’s duration. The
Monterey County Mental Health Department assists in providing appropriate housing for mentally ill
homeless persons. The Monterey County Homeless Services Resource Guide identifies the various
existing components of services and facilities for homeless individuals in Monterey County. Table 20,
Monterey County Homeless Resources documents the resources that are available.

San Benito Counties (2011)
Lead Me Home: Game Plan for Housing Homeless in San Benito and Monterey Counties (Game Plan), listed
the following priorities to prevent homelessness:
        Assure access to adequate housing
        Provide services to keep people housed
        Support economic stability
        Return people to housing through adequate discharge planning
In order to provide adequate access to housing the Game Plan prioritizes maintenance or development
of emergency shelters or transitional housing as needed for targeted populations who are in life
transition, including families, people with mental or substance abuse disorders, farm workers, youth,
victims of domestic violence, and released prisoners. Next, the Game Plan suggests cities should analyze
existing emergency shelter and transitional housing programs and develop a plan and timeline for
converting units to permanent housing. Finally, each jurisdiction should measure performance “on a
systemic level and make adjustments to the mix of housing, as appropriate.”

Greenfield’s affordable housing programs provide housing resources for very low-income households
that may represent the population segment most susceptible to homelessness. Consequently,
continuation of these programs is critical to homelessness prevention.
The Monterey County and Greenfield resources previously discussed provide adequate emergency
services for the homeless, particularly since there are not any estimated homeless persons in Greenfield.
Further, the implementation of the above goals would support the prevention of future homelessness in
Greenfield.
Zoning Requirements for Emergency Shelters and Transitional and Supportive Housing
The 2005 Greenfield Housing Element identified the City’s need to provide equal access to housing for
people with special needs, including encouraging the development of emergency and transitional
housing. The California Government Code establishes certain local government regulatory limits related
to the development and approval of emergency shelters and transitional housing facilities. Greenfield
Municipal code chapter 17.80 was amended to provide for adequate development and operational
standards to assure appropriate housing and services for special needs populations. Chapter 17.80 is
consistent with the requirements and restrictions of the California Government Code.
Emergency shelter means housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is
limited to occupancy of six (6) months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be
denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay. As per chapter 17.80, emergency shelters are
permitted in R-M (medium density residential), R-H (high density residential), C-R (retail business), and
I-L (light industrial) zoning districts subject to the following conditions: (1) emergency shelters are
allowed in the C-R and I-L zoning districts as a permitted use without a conditional use or other
discretionary permit (2) emergency shelters are allowed in the R-M and R-H zoning districts subject to
issuance of a conditional use permit, and (3) allowance of an emergency shelter of 100 or more beds in
the C-R and I-L zoning districts is subject to issuance of a conditional use permit. A use permit generally
takes two to three months to process, and the applicant is required to submit site plans, floor plans, and
other information pertinent to understanding impacts of development at the site. The application is
routed to all departments for review, and the approving authority is the Greenfield Planning
Commission. Conditions of Approval that are applied to use permits generally focus on building and
other legal requirements, and are in no manner intended to constrain development of emergency
shelter sites. The City has capacity, including infrastructure as evidenced in its site inventory within the
Background Report, to provide at least one year round shelter in either it’s R-M, R-H zones with a
Conditional Use Permit or without a Conditional Use Permit in areas zoned I-L or C-R. The requirements
of chapter 17.80 do not apply in situations of city or statewide designated disasters or catastrophic
conditions, but only for the duration of the designated disaster or catastrophic condition.
Transitional housing contains living facilities with supportive services for up to 24 months, and targets
recently homeless individuals. Greenfield Municipal Code states that transitional housing facilities shall
be considered a residential use of property, and will be subject only to those restrictions and standards
that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zoning district. In addition to
those development standards, the following operational standards shall also apply to transitional
housing facilities: (1) the program shall provide accommodations appropriate for a maximum stay of 24
months per client, (2) the facility shall have adequate private living space, shower and toilet facilities,
and secure storage areas for its intended residents, and (3) support services shall be provided by the
transitional housing provider including a drug or alcohol abuse counseling component, appropriate
state and/or federal licensing shall be required, identification of a transportation system that will
provide its clients with a reasonable level of mobility including, but not limited to, access to social

services, housing and employment opportunities, specific mechanisms for residents to contact social
service, clear and acceptable arrangements for facility residents, such as on site meal preparations or
food provision and disbursement, and provide childcare services and ensure that school age children
are enrolled in school during their stay at the facility.
Supportive housing as defined in Section 50675.14 of the Health & Safety Code has no limit on the
length of stay and is linked to onsite or offsite services. “Services typically include assistance designed to
meet the needs of the target population in retaining housing, living and working in the community,
and/or improving health and may include case management, mental health treatment, and life skills.”
The City understands the importance of providing supportive housing and supportive services to assist
homeless persons in the transition from homelessness and to enable homeless persons to live as
independently as possible This housing element includes a program to permit supportive housing in
zones allowing residential uses and is not subject to any restrictions (e.g., occupancy limit) not imposed
on similar dwellings (e.g., single family home, apartments) in the same zone in which the transitional
housing and supportive housing is located. In 2015 the City amended Chapter 17.80 of its municipal
code to conform its emergency shelter and transitional housing ordinance with State law.
SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS
The U.S. Census Bureau defines a single parent headed household as one containing a household head
and at least one dependent, which could include a child, an elderly parent, or non-related child.
However, the analysis of single parent households in this document is limited to a family household
(with no spouse present) with one or more children under the age of 18 years. Approximately 702
households in Greenfield are single parent headed households. (However, some of these households
include an unmarried partner that may lessen the impacts normally attributed to single parent
households.)
Lower household income is one of the more significant factors affecting single parent households. Due
to lower incomes, single-headed households often have more difficulties finding adequate, affordable
housing than families with two adults. Also, single-parent households with small children may need to
pay for childcare, further reducing disposable income. This special needs group will benefit from
expanded affordable housing opportunities, especially those in proximity to employment opportunities.
More specifically, the need for dependent care also makes it important that housing for single-parent
families be located near childcare facilities, schools, recreation programs, youth services, and medical
facilities.
Single parent households often fall into the very low and low-income household category and face
housing affordability problems. According to the 2013 American Community Survey,, of the total 3,434
households in Greenfield, single female head of householders with their own children less than 18 years
of age total 464 households, or 13.6 percent of all Greenfield households. Single male head of
householders, with their own children less than 18 years of age total 238, or approximately 6.9 percent
of the population. Greenfield averaged single parent percentages slightly higher than Monterey
County’s female head of householders at 13.1 percent, and male head of householders at 6.7 percent, as
well as the State of California average of 13.5 percent female head of householders and 5.9 percent male
head of householders.
In addition, single parent heads of households with children often have special needs such as the
availability of affordable daycare and adequately sized, low-cost housing. This is mirrored in the census
data that indicates that approximately 28.7 percent (133 of 464 households) of the City's female head of
households with children are below poverty level and approximately 33.6 percent of the male-headed
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                              6-48

                                                                                 6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
households with children are below poverty line. Based on household overpayment data, there appears
to be an existing need for very low and low income housing for this special needs group. However, it is
important to note that in 2010, 44 percent of female heads of household were below the poverty line so
there has been a significant improvement for this demographic within the last few years.
ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS
Elderly individuals are described as individuals who are 65 years and older. According to the 2013
American Community Survey, Greenfield’s population includes 799 elderly individuals representing 4.8
percent of the City’s population (down from 911 in the 2010 U.S. Census). Two hundred and fifty-three
households, representing only 1.5 percent of the City’s households, are headed by a householder 65
years or older. Many of these households may be in need of services for the elderly such as medical
facilities or adult daycare. In addition, due to increased longevity rates, it is probable that the percentage
of elderly in the population will increase in the future.
Existing Services and Resources for the Elderly
Cielo Vista is a licensed adult residential care facility in the City of Greenfield, which accepts seniors.
Residents must be ambulatory and in good health. While not strictly a senior care facility, it provides
housing for 40 persons with physical and mental disabilities. The facility includes 40 bedrooms and is
able to house only individuals. Cost is based on income, and supplanted by SSI, Medicaid and the
Monterey County Health Department. The facility maintains a waiting list. Clients are referred to the
facility by the Monterey County and other County mental health departments. The facility includes
programs and therapy as part of its operations.
Touch of Grace Residential Care Home is a residential care facility that has 29 beds and accepts non-
ambulatory residents. This facility accepts SSI benefits.
Zoning Requirements for Elderly Care Facilities
According to the Greenfield Zoning Code, Residential Care Homes are facilities that provide non-medical
24-hour care. Small and large Residential Care Homes are only permitted in areas zoned for residential
use. Small Residential Care Homes, which provide care for six or less adults, do not require conditional
use permits while large residential homes, caring for more than six adults, do require a CUP for the
purpose of assuring compatibility with adjacent properties due to their potential size. Convalescent and
nursing homes, which provide medical care, are allowed in commercially zoned areas.
DISABLED PERSONS AND HOUSEHOLDS
“Disabled households” include households containing persons that are disabled because of a physical
disability or because of an intellectual or developmental disability. While some individuals may have
both a physical and intellectual or developmental disability, the Census data does not provide that level
of specificity. According to the 2013 U.S. Census data, there were 151 people with a disability from ages
5 to 17, 747 people with disabilities from ages 18 to 64, and 378 people with disabilities that were 65
and older. This a significant decline in persons living with disabilities in 2000 during which 2,334 people
16 to 64 years had a disability and 667 people 65 years and over had a disability.
In 2013, of the total 747 people with disabilities ages 18 to 64, 231 were employed. Of those employed
with a disability, females with a disability make significantly less than males with a disability. Table 21,
Median Income for Persons with a Disability presents this information. Information specific to how

disabilities affect housing needs is not available. However, persons with disabilities generally have
lower incomes, especially when the disability affects the person’s ability to work and thus affordable
housing is a high priority for these individuals.

Those with a disability that affects mobility are also often in need of affordable housing that is physically
accessible. Examples of accessibility in housing include widened doorways and hallways, ramps leading
to doorways, modifications to bathrooms and kitchens (lowered countertops, grab bars, adjustable
shower heads) and special sensory devices (smoke alarms, light switches, door bells).
Developmentally Disabled Persons
A “developmental disability” is defined as a disability that originates before the individual is 18 years old
and “continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for
that individual.” According to the Director of Developmental Services, this term includes mental
retardation, including disabling conditions closely related to mental retardation or requiring similar
treatment, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. However, this definition does not include disabilities
that are strictly physical in nature.
While many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment, those with more severe disabilities may require a group living environment with
supervision or an institutional environment where medical attention can be provided. Because
developmental disabilities exist before the person has reached the age of 18, supportive housing for the
transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an adult is imperative. The State Department of
Developmental Services currently provides community based services to persons with developmental
disabilities through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two
community-based facilities. The San Andreas Regional Center serving Monterey County is one of 21
regional centers in California that provides “point of entry” services to those that are developmentally
disabled. The San Andreas Regional Center is a non-profit community agency that contracts with local
businesses to provide services to developmentally disabled persons and their families. Table 22,
Persons with Developmental Disabilities in Greenfield, provides information from the San Andreas
Regional Center on persons with developmental disabilities.
Existing Services and Resources for the Disabled
Cielo Vista in Greenfield provides a housing resource for disabled individuals that are ambulatory. While
there has been a decrease in the amount of disabled individuals living in Greenfield, it is likely that with
1,276 disabled individuals that the Cielo Vista residential care resource is inadequate to serve the
disabled population and thus additional residential care facilities and services are needed.

Zoning Requirements for Disabled Care Facilities
The City’s zoning ordinance does not include a definition of “family,” so does not exclude
accommodation of non-blood relation households within single-family houses or residential districts.
Small residential care facilities are permitted without the necessity of obtaining a conditional use permit
within residential districts while large residential care facilities are subject to obtaining a use permit.
However, these facilities do not provide medical care. The City imposes a 1,000 foot separation
restriction on residential care homes.
No application for the construction of residential facilities for the disabled or for an emergency shelter
has been denied by the City. In addition, the Building Code permits, and the City accommodates, the
adaptation of structures for improved access for persons with disabilities. City staff is available to work
with applicants to achieve a successful project to adapt a structure to improve accessibility. Many homes
in Greenfield have been adapted for disabled access.
The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not prohibit the development of residential facilities for the disabled
or emergency shelters, nor does the ordinance discriminate against persons with disabilities in the
enactment or administration of zoning regulations. The City does not impose different requirements on
residential developments for the disabled or on emergency shelters that are assisted by the federal or
state government or by a local public entity. Use permits are required for the development of large care
facilities within the City, without regard to the type of residents that will be housed at the facilities.
The zoning ordinance is somewhat ambiguous regarding the permitted locations of facilities specifically
providing care for the disabled. This ambiguity may serve as a disincentive to the proposed
development of such facilities. The Housing Element contains policies and programs to evaluate the
City’s existing regulations and remove constraints on the development of housing for persons with
disabilities. The program’s purpose is the adoption of clear regulations that remove constraints to
development and facilitate reasonable accommodations for housing designed for, intended for
occupancy by, or with supportive services for persons with disabilities.
In addition, a program has been included to evaluate actions the City might implement to promote
housing opportunities within the community for persons with disabilities.

FARMWORKER AND EMPLOYEE HOUSING
The State’s definition of farmworker is broad, equating the term “farmworker” with the term
“agricultural worker.” This includes anyone involved in “cultivation or tillage of the soil; dairying; the
production, cultivation, growing, and harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities; the
raising of livestock, bees, fur-bearing animals, or poultry; and any incident to or in conjunction with
such farming operations, including preparation for market and delivery to storage or to market or to
carriers for transportation to market.” The number of employees that fall under this category is large
with varied housing needs.
As a result of unionization and extended growing seasons, the agricultural industry now provides more
stable employment and higher wages than in the past. The result has been a reduction in migratory
patterns; farm workers are staying longer or settling in areas offering a more regular income. These
individuals are now considered a mainstay of the community and are no longer considered "transient
workers." Growers often tend to hire workers who previously worked for them, encouraging more
stable residence.
However, many agricultural workers have a difficult time finding affordable housing. This is due to a
combination of factors such as limited English skills, large family size, and low household income. The
problem is compounded because many farmworker housing units in California were originally
constructed for seasonal use by single men. Now, laborers and their families often use these units year-
round.
Accurate farmworker data and statistics are hard to gather due to the migrant status of some workers
while others may simply reside in neighboring communities. Thus, reported numbers of farmworkers in
Monterey County vary widely depending on the data source. The 2010 AMBAG population forecast
reported 45,100 agricultural workers in Monterey County. While the 2007 Census of Agriculture
counted only 26,181 hired farm labor workers in Monterey County working on 571 farms. Neither of
these figures includes families of farmworkers, whose housing needs must also be considered. Median
annual income was $18,852, lower than any other occupational category and less than the California
Self-Sufficiency Standard, as well as federal poverty guidelines for a family of four.
The best available farmworker data, beyond the U.S. Census estimates, is a farmworker needs
assessment conducted in 2000 by Applied Survey Research and the Center for Community Advocacy.
This study, Farmworker Housing and Health Assessment Study, 2001, provides information from
respondents in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties. In-person interviews were conducted with 780
farmworkers in the Salinas and Pajaro Valleys during October and November 2000. The respondents,
however, may not have included a high proportion of seasonal workers since the survey was conducted
after peak season. Of the farmworkers surveyed, 61 percent were male, 97 percent were Spanish
speaking, 99 percent were Mexican-American or Mexican and 79 percent were between the ages of 18
and 44. The study found that 78 percent of respondents were living with a spouse and about two-thirds
lived with a spouse and at least one child.
The study also found that housing costs are an obstacle for farmworkers. Only 10 percent of
farmworkers owned a home and 89 percent rented from a non-employer. Fifty-seven percent paid a
disproportionate amount of income for housing. Salinas Valley farmworker respondents paid an
average of 47 percent of their income for housing. The average household size was 5.3 and 68 percent
were living in units with more than two persons per bedroom and one-third shared their home with
one or more non-family members.
According to 2013 Census data, Greenfield’s total labor force was 6,692. This represents about 41
percent of the total population. Census data for employment by industry indicated that 2,375 persons
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                         6-52

                                                                              6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
(35.5 percent) reported employment in “agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining.” Due to
the limited opportunities for employment in fishing, forestry, and mining industries in Greenfield, it can
be assumed that the vast majority of this employment is in agriculture. In 1990, 1,214 persons were
employed in this category, as compared to 2,210 persons in 2000 and 2,375 in 2013.
Greenfield is heavily dependent on agriculture. Most of the land area surrounding the City and within its
Sphere of Influence is in agricultural production. Consequently, farmworker and migrant worker
housing needs are one of the more prevalent housing issues in the community due to the agriculture-
based economy.
Given the circumstances of migrant farm labor, it is difficult to determine the full extent of unmet needs
for farmworker housing. Greenfield currently has no units exclusively for use as farmworker housing.
However, there are several farmworker labor camps adjacent to and within Greenfield city limits that
house farmworkers, including Rocha’s Camp on 13th and Apple and a second on Elm Avenue.
Additionally, Community Housing Improvement Systems and Planning Association (CHISPA) built 40
self-help units for farmworkers.
In 2015, the Monterey County Board of Supervisors approved an affordable housing project for seasonal
farmworkers in Spreckles that would house approximately 800 workers in dormitory style apartments.
This project may address some of the farmworker housing needs for those who live outside of, but
travel into Greenfield for work. However, the Farmworker Housing and Health Assessment Study,
supra, found that group dormitory-type housing would not suitably address the housing needs of many
of the respondents (78 percent), since they live with a spouse. Two-thirds of the respondents indicated
that they also have children living with them and 57 percent of the respondents are paying a
disproportionate amount of income on housing; thus, the greatest current housing need is for affordable
family housing for farmworkers.
Zoning Requirements for Farmworker Housing
Greenfield’s zoning ordinance includes the R-M Multiple Family Residential and the RH High Density
Infill districts, which permit several residential categories that could accommodate construction of
farmworker housing. These include multi-family dwellings, which are permitted by right, and group
residential, which require a conditional use permit. Farmworker and employee housing consistent with
Health and Safety Code section 17000 et seq. is not currently addressed in the City’s zoning ordinance.
The Housing Element includes a program to update the code to conform to state law.
Farmworkers could also be accommodated in single-room occupancy units. The R-H High Density Infill
District provides a transition from the central business district to lower density residential areas. This
district is reserved for those areas in close proximity to the central business district and community
facilities. This district would be ideal for the development of single-room occupancy facilities that could
serve the need of single farmworkers, along with other low-income individuals. The City should
consider amending its zoning ordinance to allow or conditionally allow single resident occupancy units
in appropriate residential zoning districts.
Infrastructure Capacity to Support Housing
A significant factor that can add to the cost of residential development is the availability and adequacy of
infrastructure, including water, sewer, and roadway networks. SB 1087 requires water and sewer
providers to grant priority service allocations to proposed developments that include low-income
housing.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                           6-53

                                                                            6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Water Supply
California, including the Salinas Valley is currently experiencing groundwater overdraft. Water
discharge from Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio helps prevent the overdraft of aquifers in the
southern Salinas Valley. However, these lakes are at record setting low water levels and discharges are
minimal. Because of drought conditions in California, there are rising concerns over groundwater
supplies in the area. Although water shortages have not led to the denial of housing projects, cumulative
impacts associated with groundwater overdraft in the Salinas Valley may lead to denial of future
projects resulting in a potential constraint. A review of groundwater quality data for Greenfield
indicates that groundwater in the area is recharged by the Salinas and Arroyo Seco Rivers. The
Greenfield Public Works Department is responsible for water supply and delivery in the community.
Local groundwater is currently the sole source of water supply. The City currently serves over 3,700
water meters with nearly 90 percent of the service connections for single family and multi-family
residences. In 2013 the total potable water demand in Greenfield was 5.4 acre- feet per day or 1,967
acre-feet annually (AFA). With the continuing severe drought facing California and executive orders
issued by the Governor’s Office, emergency water conservation regulations issued by the State Water
Resources Control Board, and active water conservation programs implemented by the City, total water
consumption for 2015 is on track to total approximately 1,570 acre-feet, or 4.3 acre-feet per day. Prior
to the impact of these water conservation directives, the projected need for 2020 was 5.7 acre feet per
day or 2093 AFA. Current capacity is 18.2 acre-feet per day, which equates to a total annual capacity of
6,694 AFA, which is sufficient to serve anticipated housing growth in the City. The City currently
operates three groundwater wells. The wells pump directly into the one million-gallon Oak Avenue
reservoir located at the intersection of 13th Street and Oak Avenue and the 1.5 million gallon reservoir
located at the City’s public works maintenance yard at Walnut Avenue and 10th Street. System demands
are met by continually filling the reservoirs.
Sewer
Greenfield’s sewer plant operates at a flow of approximately 930,000 gallons per day and has approval
to expand the plant to a capacity of 2.0 million gallons per day (MGD). The treated water is dispersed
using spray fields. The wastewater system includes over 110,000 feet of gravity sewer ranging in
diameter from 6 to 24 inches. The City has over 3,600 sewer connections most of which are for single
family residential accounts. The sewer system has been extended over time as the City has expanded.
Located in alleys and easements of the original downtown area, the sanitary sewer is predominately 6-
inches in diameter. Newer pipes in residential areas to the west and east of the downtown area tend to
be 8-inches in diameter and are generally aligned in streets right-of-way. There is a network of trunk
sewers that generally flow west to east and discharge into the Greenfield Wastewater Treatment Plant,
located at the end of Walnut Avenue east of Second Street. The City's existing permit was issued in May
of 2002 and it increased the City's allowable discharge to 1.5 million MGD from the previous limit of 1.0
MGD. When improvements to the water treatment ponds are completed in 2016, the permitted
discharge capacity will be increased to 2.0 MGD. Thus, there is sufficient sewer capacity in the existing
system to provide capacity for an additional flow rate of 1,070,000 gallons per day.
Roadways
U.S. Highway 101 provides regional access to the City of Greenfield. Two major interchanges are located
at the intersections of the freeway with Oak Avenue and Walnut Avenue. Two other interchanges are
located at both extremities of El Camino Real. El Camino Real serves as the City’s main street and
shopping district. The roadway network is comprised mainly of collector streets forming a grid with
blocks of approximately 300-feet by 600-feet, bisected by alleys. At LOS “C,” all four major intersections
currently operate at levels of service above the standard for the City.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                          6-54

There is an important relationship between the ability to provide needed housing and functional
transportation routes and systems. Anticipating significant increases in population, the City developed a
Transportation Master Plan to be used with the circulation element of the General Plan. This plan
determined the needed improvements for the anticipated future land uses along with the funding
mechanisms for implementation of the various recommended roadway improvements.

4.       EVALUATION OF PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
4th Cycle Programs
The Housing Element adopted by the City in 2012 (fourth cycle housing element) covered the five-year
planning period from June 2009 through June 2014, and included one overall goal and seven focused
goals with programs:
4th Cycle Overall Housing Goal: Provide safe, healthy, and affordable housing to all residents by
maintaining and improving existing housing stock and by providing expanded housing opportunities.
This goal reflects the City’s intent to address the following goals, objectives, and policies, as well as
implement the following programs.
GOAL ONE:         PROVIDE   FOR THE    CITY’S REGIONAL SHARE OF NEW HOUSING FOR ALL INCOME
GROUPS
4th Cycle Program 1.1
Encourage the construction of at least 427 new housing units in Greenfield by 2014,
rehabilitation/conservation of at least 35 units, and construction, rehabilitation, and conservation of at
least an additional 245 housing units through the end of the planning period.
Specific Actions and Rationale: Pursuant to AMBAG’s allocated housing numbers, the City shall
encourage the construction of new housing, based on the quantified objectives by income group set
forth in the table below:
         Quantified                    New
                                                           Rehabilitation              Conservation
     Income Objective             Construction
 Very Low                              120                         8                         18
 Low                                    90                         3                         6
 Moderate                               102                        0                         0
 Above Moderate                        226                         0                         0
 TOTAL                                 538                        11                         24
Progress
The prior Housing Element covered a period of time characterized by a severe shift from good economic
times to the most significant economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Due to
economic conditions, new housing development in the City from 2008 to 2011 was nearly non-existent.
Because of these market conditions over which the City had no control or influence, the City was not
able to meet the RHNA targets during the timeframe. Nonetheless, non-profit housing developers
completed about 106 low and very low income units during the planning period, about half of the RHNA
goal.
4th Cycle Program 1.2
Use the 2005 General Plan update Land Use Diagram and Sphere of Influence as guidelines for future
residential development to meet the City’s regional share of housing in all income categories.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                         6-56

                                                                           6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Progress
The City continued to use the General Plan Land Use Diagram to guide development, but due to severe
economic conditions, very little construction occurred during the planning period. The City had already
adopted an updated zoning code in July of 2007.
4th Cycle Program 1.3
Encourage innovative housing design and “smart growth” strategies by adopting a provision to allow
Mixed Use Development in the Zoning Ordinance.
Specific Actions and Rationale:
1. In accordance with commitments in the predecessor Housing Element, Section 17.42.030 of the
City’s current zoning ordinance adopted in July of 2007, provides for mixed use(s). The purpose of the
Mixed Use Overlay District is to provide an opportunity for the development of residential units in
conjunction with different underlying zoning designations.
2. The City further encourages use of the Planned Unit Development process to create additional
inclusionary units in developments where mixed use(s) coexist with traditional zoning. For instance the
Creekbridge St. Charles Place project, completed in 2007, includes 36,871 square feet of ground floor
retail and 137 apartment units.
Progress
This program was already implemented prior to the planning period when the updated zoning code
was adopted in July of 2007.
4th Cycle Program 1.4
The City shall encourage a diversity of housing types that will meet the range of needs of all income
groups by maintaining an adequate supply of appropriately zoned land with available or planned public
services and infrastructure to accommodate the City's projected housing needs for all income levels and
for special needs groups.
Specific Actions and Rationale:
1. The updated site inventory completed in 2008, demonstrates that sufficient capacity exists for the
development of higher density, multi-family units and the City’s AMBAG allocation. Specifically,
densities as high as 21 units per acre are allowed in the Special High Density Multifamily Residential
Overlay Zone.
2. The City is currently working with LAFCO to annex lands needed for residential development. The
area is designated as the "Sphere of Influence". The County, the Local Agency Formation Commission,
and the City agree this area represents acreage where development should occur. Since LAFCO is the
governing body that authorizes requests for annexation into the City, staff continually collaborates with
LAFCO personnel regarding the housing needs of City residents. When an annexation project comes
before LAFCO, the LAFCO staff and board are well briefed regarding the need for additional land for
residential development in Greenfield.
Progress
Municipal Code Section 17.42.080 presents the City’s Special High Density Multifamily Residential
Overlay Zone. Density up to 21 units per acre is allowed in this and the High Density Residential zoning
districts within the City. The Special High Density Multifamily Residential Overlay Zone is currently
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                         6-57

                                                                            6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
applied to the Clifton Court mobile home park. The City and LAFCO completed negotiations on their
Sphere of Influence Memorandum of Agreement. In 2013 the Memorandum of Agreement was
approved to allow for the City, County, and LAFCO to evaluate future annexation proposals included in
the March 2007 Sphere of Influence or in future amendments to the Greenfield Sphere of Influence. This
will allow Greenfield to provide adequate land for residential development. The Memorandum of
Agreement serves to satisfy the requirements imposed on the City which requires the City and LAFCO to
enter into an agreement prior to any annexation to the City on 10 issues including: long term direction
of growth, urban development patterns, and regional housing needs.
4th Cycle Program 1.5
Encourage a compatible mixture of different types of residential units within lands that annex to the
City.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City strives to create a successful jobs/housing balance and
encourage a variety of residential types in lands annexed to the City. Toward that objective, the City
adopted a mixed-use zoning overlay district, and will expand this overlay in future annexations when
possible.
Progress
No annexations took place during the planning period.
4th Cycle Program 1.6:
Ensure that requisite parking requirements for residential development do not create a barrier to
inclusionary housing developments, particularly as applied to multi-family projects.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The existing parking requirements were established pursuant to Chapter
3.0 of the Greenfield General Plan adopted in March of 2005 and its attendant Environmental Impact
Report. The parking requirements were analyzed, reviewed and then established by the City Council
with City-wide circulation best-practices paramount. This careful evaluation prevented both
unwarranted regulatory barriers to residential development and also, excessive leniency which would
itself create a barrier to development. The City of Greenfield has created a balance between parking
requirements and seamless development that includes residential, inclusionary and mixed-use projects.
Progress
The parking standards were already in place and considered suitable prior to the planning period.
GOAL TWO:        ENCOURAGE THE PROVISION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
4th Cycle Program 2.1
Identify and participate in opportunities that encourage the provision of affordable housing.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall consider, on a case-by-case basis, the waiver, reduction, or
deferral of fees, or the provision of other incentives, which are appropriate for the provision of
affordable housing. Additionally, the City routinely considers supporting applications for inclusionary
projects through CTAC and CDBG programs.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                          6-58

                                                                             6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Progress
Very few development applications were received during the planning period; however, non-profit
housing builders did complete about 106 low and very low income units during the planning period.
4th Cycle Program 2.2
Continue to implement the inclusionary housing program.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall continue to implement the inclusionary housing program
to require affordable housing units with new development to ensure production of a minimum
percentage of very low, low, and moderate-income units within new residential developments. The
program requires that affordable residential units be included within all housing developments and that
such units be dispersed throughout the development and is visually indistinguishable from market rate
units.
Progress
Chapter 17.51, Inclusionary Housing, was added to the Greenfield Municipal Code during the planning
period in 2011 (Note this had already happened when the 4th Cycle Housing Element was completed)
This inclusionary housing ordinance was designed to enhance the public welfare by assisting in meeting
the City’s regional share of housing needs; assisting in the implementation of the Housing Element goals,
policies, and programs; and ensuring compatibility between future housing development and housing
units affordable to persons of very low, low, and moderate income by requiring that developable land in
the City is utilized in a manner consistent with state and local land use and housing policies.
4th Cycle Program 2.3
Consider restricting a portion of the affordable housing developed in Greenfield for sale to existing
residents.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The collapse of the housing industry in 2008 created an environment
where today’s pricing of market rate housing in Greenfield, remains on par with deed restricted
inclusionary units. Also, an abundance of home foreclosures has left entire neighborhoods with
unacceptable percentages of unoccupied residential dwellings in otherwise healthy neighborhoods.
Neighboring communities in the Salinas Valley experiencing identical phenomena further exacerbates
the City’s ability to place low-income persons and families into affordable units. In short, an oversupply
of housing stock -- both inclusionary and market rate, removes the need to restrict sale of affordable
units to Greenfield residents. When the percentage of unoccupied units declines significantly, the City
only then would consider the merits of limiting the sale of affordable units to Greenfield residents.
Applicants to the City’s First Time Home Buyer program, however, must be residents of Greenfield to
qualify for the program.
Progress
Due to the severe economic downturn and significant supply of housing, this program was not
considered necessary during the planning period and was not implemented. Very few vacancies remain
now, but due to fair housing concerns, the City is not pursuing this under the 5th Cycle Housing Element.
4th Cycle Program 2.4
Reduce mitigation requirements for very low, low, and moderate income residential project sites.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                          6-59

                                                                             6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall exempt that portion of residential projects that contain
dwelling units affordable to very low, low, and moderate-income households from the mitigation
requirements of the agricultural land conversion ordinance. The City continues to work with applicants
whose projects require Department of Fish and Game (DFG) mitigation to develop a mitigation plan that
is financially feasible.
Progress
Very few development applications were received during the planning period; however, non-profit
housing builders did complete about 106 low and very low income units during the planning period.
Conversion of agricultural land to urban uses is now subject to the provisions of the City’s Memorandum
of Agreement with LAFCO.
4th Cycle Program 2.5
Pursue additional sources of funding for maintaining and expanding the supply of subsidized housing
for low-income households.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall apply for state and federal programs that would help meet
the City’s identified housing needs and objectives. Specific programs which the City will explore are: the
State’s Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG), Joe Serna Jr. Farmworker Housing Grant
Program (FWHG), Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME), CalHOME, and Multifamily Housing
Program (MHP), as well as U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Housing Service and U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development programs to finance low- and moderate income housing, and state
and federal programs aimed at providing housing and related services to homeless individuals. In past
efforts to pursue every opportunity possible, Greenfield lost its eligibility to apply for CDBG programs
due to; 1) non-performance of the developer and; 2) City staff turnover, which resulted in a breakdown
in reporting to HCD. Consequently, while pursuing the aforementioned opportunities, the City also
recognizes that subsidized projects must be sufficiently vetted to ensure construction and that the City
possesses sufficient capacity to adhere to all attendant requirements associated with said programs.
The City shall work with non-profit and for-profit developers to make use of programs directed to
housing builders and will support applications by such entities for housing that demonstrably benefits
the community.
The City shall expand City staff, as funding permits, to provide for grant writing and grant
administration activities.
The City shall develop a list of funding priorities of housing needs and objectives for the planning period.
Progress
Very few development applications were received during the planning period; however, non-profit
housing builders did complete about 106 low and very low income units during the planning period.
The City has not been able to fund additional staff positions and has not developed a priority list. The
City was awarded a HOME grant for a 48 unit multi-family affordable housing project that is currently
under construction. The City also partnered with a non-profit builder to obtain tax credit financing for
the construction of a 32 unit senior housing project, which has been completed. The City now has a
CDBG award, which includes homebuyer assistance and housing rehabilitation programs, and for the
next three years has joined with Monterey County, Salinas, Gonzales, and Seaside to be an entitlement
city. The City’s CDBG allocation will be approximately $230,000 for each of the next three years.

                                                                            6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
4th Cycle Program 2.6
Cooperate with nonprofit organizations, public agencies, and for-profit housing providers that seek to
develop affordable housing in the City to achieve the City's Housing Element goals.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall provide information to the public and to developers
regarding approved residential developments and vacant residential land supply. The City shall identify
and provide information regarding sites that are suitable for multifamily and self-help single family
housing. The City shall encourage a compatible mixture of different types of residential units within
lands that annex to the City, in conformance with the 2005 General Plan Land Use Diagram.
Progress
The City worked with non-profit housing builders to complete 106 low and very low units during the
planning period. Cooperation with LAFCO also resulted in success in completing the Sphere of Influence
MOA that allows the City to proceed with annexations, which will allow the City to bring additional
residential land into the City.
4th Cycle Program 2.7
Encourage and allow new subdivisions to contain a percentage of smaller lots and/or zero lot line lots in
an effort to help provide the City's regional share of affordable housing.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall continue to encourage and allow new single-family
subdivisions in appropriately designated locations to contain a percentage of smaller lots and/or zero
lot lines where appropriate, to provide diversity in housing availability.
Progress
Due to severe economic conditions, very little subdivision or development occurred during the planning
period, and there was essentially no opportunity to implement this program.
4th Cycle Program 2.8
Encourage the construction of second dwelling units in appropriate locations within the community in
order to provide additional affordable housing opportunities.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City encourages second dwelling units in appropriately designated
locations. The City will be moving forward to re-consider zoning requirements to reduce on-site
parking for second dwelling units and evaluate lowering impact fees for second-dwelling units to
enhance the viability of the program
Progress
Municipal Code Chapter 17.90 is the City’s secondary unit ordinance. The City did not further address
this program during the planning period.
4th Cycle Program 2.9
Encourage and allow density bonuses to developments that provide affordable units in accordance with
State law.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The density bonus program, contained in the density bonus ordinance
section of the Greenfield Subdivision Ordinance, is a successful and quantifiable program that allows the
developer of a project to develop while providing affordable housing. The density bonus ordinance will
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                        6-61

                                                                           6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
be amended as required to maintain consistency with the requirements of State law. The City will
encourage developers to use density bonuses through the use of the Planned Development process
Progress
Municipal Code Chapter 17.50 is the City’s density bonus/inclusionary housing ordinance. The
requirements of the ordinance apply to all new development applications. AB 2222 became effective
after the close of the 4th Cycle.
4th Cycle Program 2.10
Encourage use of the Planned Unit Development by private developers as permitted by the zoning
ordinance to help reduce costs and provide affordable housing units.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The Planned Unit Development process allows a developer the flexibility
to deviate from a strict interpretation of the zoning code. When combined with the city’s affordable
housing program, both the city and the developer can effectively negotiate required affordable units to
meet AMBAG milestones.
Progress
Municipal Code Section 17.16.080 presents the City’s planned development process and regulations.
The City utilizes this section when requested in development applications.
4th Cycle Program 2.11
Cooperate and work with the Housing Authority of Monterey County to preserve and increase the
existing affordable units managed by the agency through their Section 8 certificate program.
Specific Actions and Rationale: To preserve and increase the numbers of assisted units in the City.
Whenever funding is available for additional units, or new programs are made available through the
agency, the City will work to ensure that information is disseminated to the general public. The Housing
Department will continue to promote and market these programs to prospective tenants through its
outreach programs. These include mailings, public events, and distribution of material at key sites in
the city.
Progress
The City cooperates with other entities in regard to the provision of affordable housing. Despite severe
economic conditions, about 106 low and very low income units were completed during the planning
period. The City provides informational brochures in the City Hall lobby area and has posted
information on its website about a CDBG homebuyer assistance program available through the City.
4th Cycle Program 2.12
Cooperate with public agencies and non-profit housing organizations in mutual efforts to provide
affordable housing.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The programs for Section 8 housing and the U.S. Department of
Agricultural Rural Housing Services have been proven successful for the provision of housing for very
low and low-income families. The City shall work closely with these organizations to ensure that all
available programs are advertised to the citizens of the City for the attainment of affordable housing,
either as homeowners or renters.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                        6-62

                                                                           6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Progress
The City cooperates with other entities in regard to the provision of affordable housing. Despite severe
economic conditions, about 106 low and very low income units were completed during the planning
period. The City provides informational brochures in the City Hall lobby area and has posted
information on its website about a CDBG homebuyer assistance program available through the City.
Goal Three:      Improve/conserve the existing supply of housing
4th Cycle Program 3.1
Promote the rehabilitation of 20 units by 2014.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City continues to implement its housing rehabilitation program
through HOME and CalHOME funds. The City also partners with Monterey County for implementation
of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to rehab foreclosed properties. The Housing Department
will continue to promote and market this program to prospective tenants through its outreach
programs. These include mailings, public events, and distribution of material at key sites in the city.
Progress
The City participated in housing rehabilitation programs during the planning period including the
HOME program, and has a 2015 CDBG award. The City provides informational brochures in the City Hall
lobby area and has posted information on its website about a housing rehabilitation program available
through the City.
4th Cycle Program 3.2
Survey all residential units within Greenfield annually for code violations and maintain a current
database regarding needed housing repairs.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City is considering an ordinance that triggers an inspection of
properties by the Building Official upon sale, for the purpose of creating a register of building code
violations requiring remedy.
Progress
The City did not implement this program during the planning period due to insufficient fiscal resources
and staffing levels.
4th Cycle Program 3.3
Seek through code enforcement, the private rehabilitation of substandard dwelling units and the
demolition of substandard units that are not economically feasible to repair. In concert with the
Community Development Department, the City has assigned a community service officer within the
Police Department to assist in the identification and enforcement of code violations.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall attempt to identify substandard housing units that do not
comply with City codes and require the repair of such code violations. The City shall pursue means to
provide financial assistance to low income owners of dwelling units occupied by low-income
households that are in need of repair when possible. In applying this policy, the City shall seek to avoid
the displacement of very low and low-income households.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                            6-63

                                                                            6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Progress
The City provides informational brochures in the City Hall lobby area and has posted information on its
website about a housing rehabilitation program available through the City. The City hired a full-time
code enforcement officer in November 2013, whose duties included identifying and enforcement of
code violations. As of March 2015 that position has been vacant. The City is actively attempting to hire
another code enforcement officer. The City has a current CDBG award for housing rehabilitation
programs.
Goal Four:       Ensure equal housing opportunity
4th Cycle Program 4.1
Cooperate with federal, state, and regional agencies to promote open housing choice and equal
opportunity housing. The City will advise the State Department of Fair Employment and Housing of any
complaints regarding housing discrimination received by the City.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall work to develop an information program to promote
housing opportunities for all persons of the community. The three components to the “Fair Housing
Program” shall include the following:
An information program to educate residents of their rights under the fair housing law;
Information regarding the role of the Housing Authority of Monterey County in accepting complaints of
fair housing violations; and
An outreach program to publicize the location of the referral agency. Outreach publicity should be
targeted to those areas most suitable for reaching persons most likely to be subjected to housing
discrimination. To reach the widest possible audience, the Housing Authority will be contacted to
ascertain the availability of information in Spanish. If Spanish materials are not available, the City shall
evaluate the possibility of providing that information.
Because the Housing Authority of Monterey County and the California Rural Assistance League are well-
established and functioning agencies dealing with this issue, the City will meet with these agencies to
determine the scope of their outreach into the community. The City shall focus on building upon those
organizations' existing programs to enhance and tailor them to Greenfield and in the case where fair
housing programs are not in existence, to develop them specifically for Greenfield.
Specific programs will include articles in the local newspapers, both English and Spanish publications;
information bulletins posted in the local post office and the library, as well as the development of
brochures describing what fair housing is and the rights of citizens to such housing. This brochure may
be displayed and distributed in the City Hall lobby.
Progress
The City provides informational brochures in the City Hall lobby area.
Goal Five:       Provide for the special housing needs of the community
(Many of the programs addressing the need for affordable housing will also benefit those households
with special housing needs within the community.)
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                           6-64

                                                                            6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
A. Homeless Individuals and Households
4th Cycle Program 5.1
Cooperate with all public and private agencies and organizations regarding emergency housing
programs to address homelessness.
Specific Actions and Rationale: Because of the City’s lack of expertise and funding for programs to
benefit persons in need of emergency shelter, the City shall cooperate with existing local agencies and
work to develop closer ties and an improved working relationship with non-profit and other
organizations providing such assistance. The City shall contact churches, the Salvation Army, Goodwill,
and the Housing Authority of Monterey County in order to implement this program.
Progress
The City works with outside agencies and other entities, and in 2015 adopted amendments to the
zoning ordinance to facilitate the provision of homeless shelters and transitional housing.
4th Cycle Program 5.2
Encourage an affordable housing developer to consider construction of three, four, and five-bedroom
units to address the high “large family” population and overcrowding.
Specific Actions and Rationale: City staff will work with affordable housing developers to provide a
greater number of units for large very low income and low-income large families. The City will continue
to provide direction and incentivize, where possible, through the use of RDA Housing funds to projects
that meet this objective.
Progress
The City cooperates with other entities in regard to the provision of affordable housing. The City no
longer has Redevelopment funds. Despite severe economic conditions, about 106 low and very low
income units were completed during the planning period. Specific data on the size of the affordable
units is not available.
4th Cycle Program 5.3
When new residential projects are proposed, continue to encourage construction of affordable
ownership and rental units for large households and to ease overcrowding.
Specific Actions and Rationale:
City staff will inform each potential developer of residential units of the need for units able to
accommodate larger families. The inclusionary housing program, in conjunction with the density bonus
ordinance, will be used to stimulate such development.
The City will consider the use of in-lieu fees to provide incentives for the development of affordable
rental and for-sale units for large households.
Progress
Due to severe economic conditions, very few development applications were received during the
planning period, and there was little opportunity to implement this program.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                       6-65

                                                                               6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
4th Cycle Program 5.4
Encourage the coordination of development of affordable housing with needed facilities for single
parent households such as daycare facilities, medical facilities, parks and recreation, and schools.
Specific Actions and Rationale: City staff will review the location of each potential development for
access to facilities of particular need by single parent families and will consider providing incentives to
mixed-use projects that serve this population.
Progress
The City coordinates with non-profit housing builders, and to extent practical, coordinates the location
of these developments with support services.
D. Elderly Households
4th Cycle Program 5.5
Evaluate the concept of developing a “second residential unit” ordinance for the City and determine the
potential for actual availability for use on existing single-family parcels.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City will conduct a review of its policies regarding second dwelling
units in residential areas to provide additional affordable housing for the elderly. Following the
completion of the review, the City will develop a Second Dwelling Unit Program that encourages second
dwelling units.
Progress
The City adopted Municipal Code Section 17.16.090 Secondary Units, prior to the planning period. In
2015 the City adopted an ordinance, Chapter 17.81 of the Municipal Code, regulating the conversion of
garages into livable space in residential zoning districts.
4th Cycle Program 5.6
Support and work with other agencies to solicit federal and state funds for low interest loans and grants
for the rehabilitation of units owned by seniors, if such funds are available.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall consider the allocation of a portion of funds received for
housing rehabilitation for loans to seniors for rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing units.
Progress
The City provides informational brochures in the City Hall lobby area and has posted information on its
website about a housing rehabilitation program available through the City.
4th Cycle Program 5.7
Remove Constraints to Housing Development and Encourage Accessible Housing.
Specific Actions and Rationale: Conduct an evaluation of potential constraints to the development of
housing for the disabled. Include community and non-profit groups who represent disabled households
in the evaluation process. Develop a program to mitigate any identified constraints.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                          6-66

                                                                             6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Progress
The City building department can waive certain development standards to accommodate
improvements necessary for the physically disabled.
4th Cycle Program 5.8
Encourage the development of mixed-use projects close to downtown to include units identified for
housing for elderly and persons with disabilities.
Specific Actions and Rationale: Utilize the mixed use designation included in the 2005 General Plan
update for property in and near the downtown area to provide development of units for those very-low
and low income households that include the elderly or persons with disabilities who, along with not
having the financial ability to own their own homes, may also need the proximity of commercial areas to
walk to downtown services. During the zoning ordinance update, the City will evaluate any constraints
to the development of housing or care facilities for persons with disabilities in and near the downtown
and will include provisions in the zoning ordinance to encourage the construction of such facilities.
Progress
The City’s Mixed Use Overlay (MUO) zoning provisions facilitate this program, and were adopted prior
to the planning period.
4th Cycle Program 5.9
Encourage the construction of additional residential care facilities in appropriate locations.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall encourage the development of residential care facilities in
appropriate locations within the community. The City shall follow the requirements of state law
regarding the establishment and permitting of residential care facilities, as provided in the Government
and Health and Safety Codes.
Progress
Municipal Code Chapter 17.88 presents the City’s residential care facility regulations. The City utilizes
this section when requested in development applications.
F. Farmworker Households
All programs in Goal 2. are intended to expand the supply of affordable housing which will benefit
farmworker households, especially family households. The following program is intended to address
the particular needs of single farmworkers.
4th Cycle Program 5.10
Explore the concept of single-room occupancy development in the downtown to provide affordable
housing for single farmworkers.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall explore appropriate locations and potential amendments
to the zoning ordinance to determine whether single-room occupancy developments will be useful in
providing housing for single farmworkers and other single low-income individuals. The City shall follow
the requirements of state law regarding the establishment and permitting of farmworker labor housing,
as provided in the Government and Health and Safety Codes.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                          6-67

                                                                             6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Progress
The City has not yet adopted zoning provisions for single-room occupancy units.
Goal Six:        Promote energy conservation
4th Cycle Program 6.1
Promote programs that emphasize energy retrofitting in existing residential structures with
improvements such as weather-stripping and insulation.
Specific Actions and Rationale: Cooperate with the local energy purveyor, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG &
E), to make available information on energy saving programs; retrofitting and weather stripping for
older non-insulated homes; and programs for low income individuals, including the elderly.
Progress
The City provides information brochures in the City Hall lobby, and has information on home
renovation programs on its website. In 2016 the City joined the Western Riverside Council of
Governments to make the California HERO program available to residents of the City to finance fixed
renewable energy, energy and water efficiency improvements, and electric vehicle charging
infrastructure on their properties.
4th Cycle Program 6.2
Promote the use of passive and active solar systems in new and existing residential buildings.
Specific Actions and Rationale: Encourage the use of energy conservation adaptations to improve the
energy efficiency of the existing housing stock and require the use of energy efficient site design and
housing development guidelines in the design and construction of new or rehabilitated residential units.
The City shall explore the development of energy conserving site design guidelines and housing
development guidelines in the rehabilitation of existing units and the construction of new housing units.
Progress
The City adopts the current version of the California Green Building Standards Code and Title 24 Energy
Code, which include the most stringent energy conservation standards for new construction. In 2015
the City added Chapter 15.28 to the Municipal Code establishing an expedited permitting procedure for
small residential rooftop solar systems.
4th Cycle Program 6.3
Cooperate with other local, state, and federal agencies, public utilities, and community organizations to
implement energy conservation programs and identify community priorities in energy matters.
Specific Actions and Rationale:
a. LIHEAP: Low-income households (less than 60% of the State Median Income Level) qualify for
financial assistance and free housing renovations to offset their energy costs. Funded by the Department
of Health and Human Services, the LIHEAP Block Grant provides two services, weatherization assistance
and financial assistance.
The Weatherization Program provides homes with free weatherization services to conserve energy,
including attic insulation, weather-stripping, minor housing repairs, and related energy conservation
measures.
Greenfield 2005 General Plan                                                                        6-68

                                                                            6.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
The Homes Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) provides financial assistance to pay the energy bills. The
average payment within the State of California is $182 per household per year.
REACH: Sponsored by Pacific Gas and Electric and administered by the Salvation Army, REACH provides
energy assistance to low-income customers. Households that do not qualify for HEAP or another
alternative assistance program may receive a one-time payment aid for energy costs. In the last 18
years, REACH has assisted 369,000 households in Northern California with more than $56 million in
total aid.
Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEM): Homebuyers that purchase energy efficient homes or renovate
houses to conserve energy qualify for special mortgage benefits through EEMs. Determined by results
from the Home Energy Rating System (HERS), home loans may include energy improvement costs
reducing homeowner’s utility bills. The California Home Energy Efficient Rating System (CHEERS) is a
local HERS and is supported by PG&E, lending institutions, and building associations.
Progress
The City provides information brochures in the City Hall lobby, and has information on home
renovation programs, including energy efficiency improvements, on its website. Goal Seven:
                 Encourage cooperation and coordination in the provision of housing
4th Cycle Program 7.1
Evaluate and coordinate all opportunities for providing services to new developments, including
formation of assessment districts, federal and state grants, and joint powers agreements.
Specific Actions and Rationale: Appropriate programs will be discussed with applicants for potential
projects during the pre-application stage as well as throughout the development project. Development
programs proven to be applicable to a particular project shall be discussed in the project's review
before the Commission and Council as well as considered for inclusion in any subdivision agreements
and/or conditions of approval.
Progress
Due to severe economic conditions, very few development applications were received during the
planning period, and there was little opportunity to implement this program,
4th Cycle Program 7.2
Include non-profit organizations, developers, and other agencies involved in the provision of housing in
the discussion and development of strategies to provide housing and to maintain housing affordability.
Specific Actions and Rationale: The City shall communicate with non-profit organizations to identify
opportunities to construct affordable housing and to develop strategies to maintain housing
affordability. The City shall utilize information available from local real estate agencies and shall
monitor rental vacancy rates to determine if action is warranted by the City to maintain the affordability
of rental housing in Greenfield.
Progress
The City coordinates with non-profit housing builders,
In spite of extremely adverse housing market circumstances, the City did, nonetheless, make progress
during this period on several fronts related to housing.

        County, and LAFCO to evaluate future annexation proposals included in the March 2007 Sphere
        of Influence or in future amendments to the Greenfield Sphere of Influence. This will allow
        Greenfield to provide adequate land for residential development. The Memorandum of
        Agreement serves to satisfy the requirements imposed on the City which requires the City and
        LAFCO to enter into an agreement prior to any annexation to the City on 10 issues including:
        long term direction of growth, urban development patterns, and regional housing needs.
       2013: CHISPA purchased the Cambria Park Subdivision, located on Apple Avenue, from a
        private developer who intended to construct market rate units on site. CHISPA constructed
        three low-income restricted homes.
Summary of Activities completed to date within the Fifth Cycle Planning Period
       2014: The City adopted the Walnut Avenue Specific Plan and adopted Chapter 17.43 of the
        Municipal Code providing for specific plan zoning. The Walnut Avenue Specific Plan area
        includes approximately 10.5 acres for high-density residential development. Upwards of 220
        multi-family residential units can be developed. Planning for the first phase of the Specific Plan
        development began in 2015 for retail/commercial uses. Residential development will be in a
        later phase.
       2015: Chapter 17.80 of the Greenfield Municipal Code, Emergency Shelters and Transitional
