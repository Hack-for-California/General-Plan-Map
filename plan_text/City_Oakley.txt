The City’s Heritage Tree Preservation Ordinance

zoning provisions. The ordinance protects

Individual Scenic Resource Topic Areas
The City’s predominantly flat landscape is rich in
scenic resources. Oakley’s scenic resources
include the waterways of the Delta, Dutch
Slough, Marsh Creek, and Contra Costa Canal,
habitat areas, and open space land. Other scenic
resources include the view of Mount Diablo

                                REQUIREMENTS FOR AN ACOUSTICAL ANALYSIS
  An acoustical analysis prepared pursuant to the Noise Element shall:
  A.        Be the financial responsibility of the applicant.
  B.        Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental noise assessment
            and architectural acoustics.
  C.        Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and locations to
            adequately describe local conditions and the predominant noise sources.
  D.        Estimate existing and projected cumulative (20 years) noise levels in terms of Ldn or CNEL
            and/or the standards of Table 1, and compare those levels to the adopted policies of the Noise
            Element.
  E.        Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies and
            standards of the Noise Element, giving preference to proper site planning and design over
            mitigation measures which require the construction of noise barriers or structural modifications
            to buildings which contain noise-sensitive land uses.
  F.        Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures have been implemented.
  G.        Describe a post-project assessment program which could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of
            the proposed mitigation measures

I. INTRODUCTION
A. PURPOSE AND CONTENT
The City of Oakley’s Housing Element is the component of the City’s General Plan that addresses housing
needs and opportunities for present and future Oakley residents through the 2015-2023 planning period and
the 2014-2022 regional housing needs allocation (RHNA) cycle. The Housing Element provides the primary
policy guidance for local decision-making related to housing. The Housing Element of the General Plan is the
only General Plan Element that requires review and certification by the State of California.
The Housing Element provides a detailed analysis of Oakley’s demographic, economic and housing
characteristics as required by State law. The Element also provides a comprehensive evaluation of the City’s
progress in implementing the past policy and action programs related to housing production, preservation,
conservation, and rehabilitation. Based on the community’s housing needs, available resources, constraints,
opportunities and past performance, the Housing Element identifies goals, policies, actions and objectives
that address the housing needs of present and future Oakley residents.
B. HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE PROCESS
The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable living
environment for every Californian as the State’s main housing goal. Recognizing the important part that local
planning programs play in pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities and counties
prepare a Housing Element as part of their comprehensive General Plans (California Government Code
Section 65580 et al.).
It is intended that this Housing Element be reviewed annually and updated and modified no less than every
five years in order to remain relevant and useful and reflect the community’s changing housing needs. This
Housing Element covers the planning period from January 2015 to January 2023. The time frame of the
planning period is determined by State law. State planning law mandates that jurisdictions within the
Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) region update and adopt their Housing Element by January
31, 2015. This document represents the update required and responds to the issues that currently face the
City.
C. STATE LAW AND LOCAL PLANNING
1. Consistency with State Law
The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan elements mandated by the State of California, as
articulated in Sections 65580 to 65589.8 of the California Government Code. State law requires that each
jurisdiction’s Housing Element consist of “an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing
needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled program actions for the
preservation, improvement, and development of housing.” The Housing Element plans for the provision of
housing for all segments of the population.
Section 65583 of the Government Code sets forth specific requirements regarding the scope and content of
each Housing Element. Table 10-1 summarizes these requirements and identifies the applicable chapters in
the Housing Element where these requirements are addressed.

       22. Include a diligent effort to achieve public participation of all            Chapters VI and VII
       economic segments of the community
2. General Plan Consistency
The Housing Element is one component of the City’s overall long-range planning strategy. The California
Government Code requires that the General Plan contain an integrated, consistent set of goals and policies.
The Housing Element is affected by policies contained in other elements of the General Plan. For example,
the Land Use Element designates land for residential development and indicates the type, location and
density of the residential development permitted in the City. Working within this framework, the Housing
Element identifies goals, policies, actions and objectives for the planning period that directly addresses the
housing needs of Oakley’s existing and future residents. The policies contained within other elements of the
General Plan affect many aspects of life that residents enjoy – the amount and variety of open space, the
preservation of natural, historic and cultural resources, the permitted noise levels in residential areas and the
safety of the residents in the event of a natural or man-made disaster.
The Housing Element policies must be consistent with policies identified in other elements of the General
Plan. The Housing Element has been reviewed for consistency with the City’s other General Plan elements.
The policies and programs in this Element reflect the policy direction contained in other parts of the General
Plan. As portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, this Housing Element will be reviewed to
ensure that internal consistency is maintained.
3. Relationship to Other Plans and Programs
The Housing Element identifies goals, objectives, policies and action programs for the 2015-2023 planning
period that directly address the housing needs of Oakley. There are a number of City plans and programs
which work to implement the goals and policies of the Housing Element. These include the City’s Municipal
Code and Specific Plans.
a. Oakley Municipal Code
The Oakley Municipal Code contains the regulatory and penal ordinances and certain administrative
ordinances of the City, codified pursuant to Sections 50022.1 through 50022.8 and 50022.10 of the
Government Code. The Oakley Municipal Code includes the City’s Zoning regulations.
The Subdivision Chapter of the Municipal Code regulates the design, development and implementation of
Oakley General Plan                                                                                           10.I-3

                                                                               10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
land division. It applies when a parcel is divided into two or more parcels; a parcel is consolidated with one or
more other parcels; or the boundaries of two or more parcels are adjusted to change the size and/or
configuration of the parcels.
The Zoning Chapter of the Municipal Code is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan, and is
designed to protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of the people. The Zoning Chapter designates
various districts and outlines the permitted, conditionally permitted and prohibited uses for each zone district.
Finally, the Zoning Chapter provides property development standards for each zone district and overall
administrative and legislative procedures.
b. Specific Plans
Specific Plans are customized regulatory documents that provide focused guidance and regulations for a
particular area to address the specific characteristics or needs for that area. They generally include a land use
plan, circulation plan, infrastructure plan, zoning classifications, development standards, design guidelines,
and implementation plan. The City has three Specific Plans: the Downtown Specific Plan, the River Oaks
Crossing Specific Plan, and the East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan
D. HOUSING ELEMENT ORGANIZATION
California Government Code Section 65583 requires a jurisdiction’s Housing Element include the following
components:
    •     A review of the previous Element’s goals, policies, objectives and programs to ascertain the
          effectiveness of each of these components, as well as the overall effectiveness of the Housing
          Element.
    •     An assessment of housing need and an inventory of resources and constraints related to meeting
          these needs.
    •     A statement of goals, policies and quantified objectives related to the maintenance, preservation,
          improvement and development of housing.
    •     A policy program that provides a schedule of actions that the City is undertaking or intends to
          undertake implementing the policies set forth in the Housing Element.
The Oakley Housing Element is organized into seven parts:
1.        Introduction - Explains the purpose, process and contents of the Housing Element.
2.        Community Profile - Describes the demographic, economic and housing characteristics of Oakley
and analyzes the current and projected housing needs in Oakley.
3.        Resources and Constraints Analysis - Analyzes the actual and potential governmental and non-

E. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
The California Government Code requires that local governments make diligent efforts to solicit public
participation from all segments of the community in the development of the Housing Element. In
compliance with this requirement, the City conducted public outreach efforts including a Community
Workshop in February 2014, formation of the Ad Hoc Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) in August 2013
and four CAC meetings throughout the update process, and three City Council meetings. Detailed
information on community outreach and participation is provided in Chapter VII.

  II. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND INVENTORY
  A. INTRODUCTION
  When preparing the Housing Element, jurisdictions must evaluate both existing and future housing
  needs for all segments of the population.
  This section analyzes demographic, economic and housing characteristics that influence the demand
  for and availability of housing. The analyses form a foundation for developing programs and
  policies that seek to address identified housing needs according to income, tenure and special needs
  groups.
  The primary data source utilized in this analysis was the Association of Bay Area Governments Data
  Package (ABAG, 2014) which has been approved for use by HCD. Additional data sources utilized
  in this analysis include the 2010 U.S. Census, the American Community Survey, the California
  Department of Finance (DOF), and the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development
  (HUD). These data sources are the most reliable for assessing existing conditions and provide a
  basis for consistent comparison with historical data and for making forecasts.
  B. COMMUNITY PROFILE
  1. Population Trends and Characteristics
  Housing needs are generally influenced by population and employment trends. This section provides
  a summary of the changes to the population size, age and racial composition of the City.
  a. Historical, Existing and Forecast Growth
  The City of Oakley is one of 19 cities in Contra Costa County. The DOF estimates that Contra Costa
  County’s population in 2010 was 1,049,025. Table 10-2 lists adjacent counties and their respective

2. Employment Trends
Housing needs are influenced by employment trends. Significant employment opportunities within a
city can lead to growth in demand for housing in proximity to jobs. The quality and/or pay of
available employment can influence the demand for various housing types and prices.
As shown in Table 10-6, in 2007-2011, 21.2 percent of Oakley residents were employed in
educational, health and social services; 14.6 percent were employed in professional, scientific,
management, administrative, and waste management services, 11.1 percent were employed in the
retail trade; and 10 percent were employed in finance, insurance, and real estate. By comparison, 19.9
percent of the overall County residents were employed in educational, health and social services;
8.9 percent were employed in professional, scientific, management, administrative, and waste
management services; and 13 percent were employed in retail trade.

housing unit. The U.S. Census Bureau defines “family” as related persons living within a single
housing unit.

i. Unit Size
In 2008-2012, the most common type of renter-occupied units was 3-bedroom units, making up 38.9
percent of renter-occupied units. The second largest group of renter-occupied units was 2-bedroom
units (27.2 percent). Of the owner-occupied units, 41.1 percent had 3 bedrooms and 40.4 percent
had 4 bedrooms. The 3- and 4- bedroom units were the most common type of housing units overall,
making up 40.6 percent and 35 percent of all housing units respectively. Table 10-16 summarizes the
distribution of unit size by tenure in 2010.

ii. Unit Type
The 2013 DOF data showed that 90.6 percent of the housing units in Oakley are single-family
detached homes. From 2000 to 2013, the number of units for all housing types increased. The
increase in single family detached homes comprised the majority of the increase in total housing

units, which increased by 47.6 percent. Table 10-17 shows Oakley’s housing inventory by unit type
from 2000 to 2013.
As shown in Table 10-18, owner-occupied housing units were predominately single-family detached,
with this type comprising 90.6 percent of all units. Multi-family housing represented 4.3% of the
housing stock and mobile homes, 3.2%.

b. Tenure
Approximately 76 percent of Oakley’s housing units were owner-occupied and 24 percent were
renter- occupied in 2010. The percentage of owner-occupied units in Oakley was comparatively
higher than Contra Costa County (67.1%).

c. Vacancy Rates
Vacancy rates are an indicator of housing supply and demand. Low vacancy rates influence greater
upward price pressures. A higher vacancy rate indicates downward price pressure. A four to five
percent vacancy rate is considered “healthy.” In 2000, the vacancy rate in Oakley was 1.6 percent.
The vacancy rate reported by DOF in 2010 was 6.6 percent. Table 10-19 summarizes the number of
occupied and vacant units in Oakley from 2000 to 2010.

d. Age of Housing Stock
The age of a housing unit is often an indicator of housing conditions. In general, housing that is 30
years or older may exhibit need for repairs based on the useful life of materials. Housing over 50
years old is considered aged and is more likely to exhibit a need for major repairs.
The ACS provides data on age of housing stock. In Oakley, 5.4 percent of the housing stock was
built before 1960 and 3 percent was built from 1960 through 1969. The majority of the housing
stock is less than 35 years old: 79.9 percent was built in 1980 or later. . Table 10-20 provides a
summary of housing stock by year built.

e. Housing Conditions
Housing is considered substandard when conditions are found to be below the minimum standard of
living conditions defined in the California Health and Safety Code. Households living in substandard
conditions are considered to be in need of housing assistance, even if they are not seeking alternative
housing arrangements, due to the threat to health and safety.
In addition to structural deficiencies and standards, the lack of infrastructure and utilities often serves
as an indicator for substandard conditions. According to the 2007-2011 ACSs, 35 occupied units in
Oakley lacked complete plumbing facilities. 285 of the occupied units lacked complete kitchen
facilities. 132 housing units had no telephone service available. It should be noted that there may be
some overlap in the number of substandard housing units, as some units may lack complete
plumbing, kitchen facilities, and/or telephone service. Table 10-21 summarizes the number of units
lacking plumbing, complete kitchen facilities, and telephone service.

Table 10-22 summarizes housing units with housing problems by the income level of the household.
“Housing problems” are considered a household that has one or more of the following housing
conditions: lacks complete plumbing, lacks complete kitchen facilities, more than one person per
room, and cost burden greater than 30 percent. The majority of housing problems occur in
households earning above median income (30.6%) and in very low income households (23.6%).

In April 2008, the City adopted Ordinance No. 06-08 (Neighborhood Preservation Ordinance)
which set property maintenance standards for the City. The purpose of adopting this Ordinance was
to establish standards for property maintenance and provide abatement of substandard conditions. In
the case of a violation, it is the responsibility of City Enforcement Officer to enforce these standards.
The Ordinance includes property maintenance standards for:
 •    Small Residential Lots (zoned R-15, R-12, R-10, R-7, R-6 and P-1)
 •    Landscaping Requirements
 •    Storage of Household Items, Construction Items and Rubbish
 •    Exterior Property Conditions
 •    Prohibited Activities
 •    Building Maintenance Requirements
 •    Vector Nuisances
 •    General Nuisances Prohibited

f. Housing Costs and Rents
This section evaluates housing cost trends in Oakley. Analyses of trends for both renter and owner-
occupied units, including rental and sales prices, are provided in comparison to ability to pay.
i.        Affordability Gap Analysis
The costs of home ownership and renting can be compared to a household’s ability to pay for
housing. Housing affordability is defined as paying no more than 30 percent of the household
income on housing expenses. Table 10-23 summarizes affordable rents and purchase prices by
income categories based on the 2013 HCD MHI of $93,500 for Contra Costa County. In this table,
affordable purchase price is calculated by assuming a 5.0 percent interest rate with a 30-year fully
amortized mortgage. It is noted that the following table estimates affordable purchase prices and
that affordability will vary for individual households. Information specific to an individual household
and a specific home, such as interest, downpayment, closing costs, and tax and assessment rates, is
necessary to calculate an affordable purchase price for any specific home sales transaction.

iii. Ownership Affordability
Based on a median sale price of $300,000 for new and resale housing units in Oakley in 2013,
moderate income households can afford homeownership. Very low and low income households
may be able to afford homeownership, as entry-level home prices are as low as $224,950 in 2014,
However, the median sale price exceeds the affordability range for lower income households. See
Table 10-23 for estimated affordable sales prices based on household income levels.
iv. Rental Prices
According to Rent.com, Zillow, and Craigslist in the first quarter of 2014, the average rental prices
were $675 for a 1-bedroom, 1-bath unit, ; $975 for a 2-bedroom unit5; a$1,625 for a 3-bedroomh
unit, and $1,875 for a 4-bedroom unit. Table 10-26 summarizes the average monthly rent by unit

v.        Rental Affordability
Based on the average monthly rents in Oakley shown in Table 10-27, extremely low and very low
income households would not be able to afford the median rates of rental housing in Oakley. The
median rents for one-bedroom and two-bedroom units would be affordable to the low, moderate,
and above moderate income households. Three-bedroom units would be affordable to large low
income households and to moderate and above moderate income households.

 C. HOUSING NEEDS
 This section provides an overview of existing housing needs in Oakley. It focuses on the following
 categories:
  •    Household overpayment
  •    Overcrowding
  •    Estimated new construction
  •    Special needs groups
 1. Households Overpaying for Housing
 Overpayment is defined as households paying more than 30 percent of their gross income on
 housing related expenses, including rent or mortgage payments and utilities. High housing costs can
 cause households to spend a disproportionate percentage of their income on housing. This may
 result in repayment problems, deferred maintenance or overcrowding.
 The impact of high housing costs is more apparent for extremely low, very low, and low income
 households, especially renter households.
 As shown in Table 10-27, 65 percent of renters in Oakley overpay for housing, with 58 percent of
 renters in the lower income groups overpaying for housing. Approximately 40 percent of all home
 owners in Oakley overpay for housing, with 22 percent of those homeowners in the lower income
 groups. The incidence of severe overpayment for housing (households paying more than 50% of
 their income toward housing costs) is highest among the lower income households, both renters and
 homeowners, with the largest numbers of households severely overpaying in the very low income
 group.

     2. Overcrowding
     An Overcrowded Housing Unit is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as a housing unit occupied by
     more than one person per room (excluding bathrooms, kitchen, hallway and closet space).
     Overcrowding can affect public facilities and services, reduce the quality of the physical environment
     and create conditions that contribute to deterioration.
     Table 10-28 summarizes number of persons per room in Oakley. In 2006-2010, 310 households in
     Oakley were overcrowded, accounting for 3 percent of all households. Of these households, 195
     were owner-occupied and 115 were renter-occupied.

     3. 2014 - 2022 Growth Needs
     ABAG is responsible for allocating housing needs to each jurisdiction in its region, including Oakley.
     A local jurisdiction’s “fair share” of regional housing need is the number of additional housing units
     needed to accommodate the forecasted growth in the number of households, to replace expected
     demolitions and conversion of housing units to non-housing uses, and to achieve a future vacancy
     rate that allows for healthy functioning of the housing market. The allocation is divided into the four
     income categories: Very-Low, Low, Moderate, and Above-Moderate. The allocation is adjusted
     throughout the region to avoid an over-concentration of lower- income households in any one
     jurisdiction. In addition to the allocations in the Very-Low, Low, Moderate and Above-Moderate
     income categories, the City must also consider the growth need for extremely low income

4. Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the population have more difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special needs. This section identifies the needs for elderly persons, large households, female-headed
households, persons with disabilities, homeless persons and farmworkers.
a. Elderly Persons
Elderly persons are considered a special needs group because they are more likely to have fixed
incomes and may require specially-designed units to live independently. Elderly persons are defined
by the HUD as persons aged 62 years and older. Elderly persons often have special needs related to
housing location and construction. Because of limited mobility, elderly persons typically need access
to public facilities (i.e., medical and shopping) and public transit. In terms of housing construction,
elderly persons may need ramps, handrails, elevators, lower cabinets and counters, and special
security devices to allow for greater self - protection. Oakley has seven residential care homes for the
elderly, which provide varying levels of living assistance to persons 60 years of age and older. These
homes include two H.E.R Residential Care Homes (152 & 156 Meadow Brook Court), KD Board &
Care (4984 Winchester Drive), Isabella Caring Hands (1684 Fernwood Drive), Spyglass Senior Villa 2
(75 Bottlebrush Court), Spyglass Senior Villa 4 (39 Calla Court), and Trust Painter’s Love Joy Rest
Home (171 Douglas Road), Foster Residential Care (4745 La Vista Drive), and Golden Shepherd’s
Home III (65 Drywood Court),
In 2010, Oakley had 2,391 senior residents, an increase of 74% since 2000. As shown in Table 10-30,
the 65 – 69 and 85 – 89 groups each increased by the largest number of seniors, with a proportional
increase of approximately 100% for each of these age brackets, and the 90 – 95 group increased by
the largest percentage (206%).

As shown in Table 10-31, 1,386 households (13% of total households) have a householder of 65
years of age or more. Of the senior households, 1,047 (76%) are owner-occupied and 339 (24%) are
renter-occupied. The ABAG data indicates that 664 (47%) of senior householders live alone.

Data from the 2007-2011 ACS indicates that 301 (15%) of senior persons had incomes below the
poverty rate. Based on 2007-2011 ACS data shown in Table 10-32, 27 percent of elderly households
earned less than $30,000, falling within the extremely low and very low income categories; and 36.7
percent earned $30,000 to $49,999, generally falling within the very low and low income categories.

In 2010, senior households accounted for 13% of total households in the City. Given the growth in
the senior population during the past decade, it is anticipated that a minimum of 13% (152 units) of
the City’s RHNA should be of housing types appropriate for senior households. As shown in Table
10-34, over half of the senior households have incomes that are generally in the extremely low, very
low, and low income categories. Therefore, it would be appropriate to provide at 76 senior units

serving the lower income ranges and 76 senior units that serve the moderate and above income
groups. Housing opportunities for senior households include senior independent living communities
that include ownership and/or rental housing opportunities, residential care facilities (both small
homes serving 6 or fewer persons and larger facilities), assisted living facilities, and skilled nursing
homes.
b. Large Households
State housing law defines large households as those having five or more persons living within the
same housing unit. Large households are considered a special needs group because they require more
bedrooms. In 2010, there were 2,322 households in Oakley with at least five persons, representing 22
percent of the total households in the City. Of the total households, 21 percent were owner-occupied
large households and 25 percent was renter-occupied large households. Refer to Table 10-33.

The median income of large households ranges from a low of $60,972 for households with six
persons to $100,238 for five person households to a high of $123,148 for households with seven or
more persons. Only six person households have a lower median income than the City-wide average,
as shown in Table 10-34.

 While large households represent a significant portion of total households in Oakley, the housing
stock in the City reflects the larger average household size. As shown in Table 10-35, there is an
excess of larger units (3 bedroom and 4 and more bedroom units) in comparison to household sizes
that are appropriate for the larger units. As noted in Table 10-29, 3 percent of households are
overcrowded and less than one percent of households are severely overcrowded. It is anticipated
that the City will continue to have a large average household size and that large households of five or
more persons will continue to represent approximately one-fifth of all households. Therefore, it is
anticipated that 22 percent (257 units) of the City’s RHNA should be provided as larger units.
c. Female-Headed Households
Female-headed households are a special needs group due to comparatively low rates of
homeownership, lower incomes and high poverty rates experienced by this group. According to the
2010 U.S. Census data provided in the ABAG Data Package, there were 995 female-headed families
with children and 417 female-headed households without children in Oakley. Female- headed
families represent a total of 16 percent of the families in the City. Table 10-36 shows the number of
female-headed households by tenure in 2000.

As shown in Table 10-37, in 2010, 12 of the female-headed households in Oakley were below
poverty level. Of those with children under the age of 18, 15 percent were below poverty level.

It is anticipated that female-headed households will continue to represent a portion of the City’s
population. While typical single family and multi-family housing is appropriate for female-headed
households with children, single female-headed householders with children may have a higher need
for nearby services, including childcare and schools. The incidence of female-headed households
below the poverty level also indicates a need for housing units that serve the extremely low income
population that provide services and amenities appropriate for female-headed households with
children.
d. Persons with Disabilities
The U.S. Census Bureau provides information on the number of persons, including the elderly, with
disabilities of varying types and degrees. The types of disabilities included in the Census are:
 •     Sensory: Blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment.
 •     Physical: A condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities, such as
       walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.
 •     Mental: A condition lasting six months or more that makes it difficult to perform certain
       activities including learning, remembering, or concentrating.
 •     Self-care: A condition lasting six months or more that make it difficult to perform certain
       activities including dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home.
 •     Go-outside-home: Only asked for population 16 and older; a condition lasting six months or
       more that make it difficult to perform certain activities including going outside the home alone
       to shop or visit a doctor's office.
 •     Employment: Only asked for the population aged 16 to 64; a condition lasting six months or
       more that make it difficult to perform certain activities including working at a job or business.
Access and affordability are the primary challenges for persons with disabilities. Access, both within
the home and to/from the home site, is important for the persons with disabilities. This often
requires specially designed dwelling units. Additionally, housing locations near public facilities and
public transit are important for this special needs group.
The U.S. Census Bureau provides information on the number of persons with disabilities of varying
types and degrees. Table 10-38 shows the number of Oakley residents with disabilities over the age
of 5. According to the 2008-2012 ACS, 9.9 percent of Oakley residents reported having one or more
types of disabilities. As summarized in Table 10-39, the majority of persons with a disability in
Oakley are not in the labor force (56 percent), while 10 percent are unemployed and 34 percent are
employed. Table 10-41 identifies the types of disabilities reported for persons aged 18-64 in Oakley.
Five percent of disabled persons have an independent living difficulty, meaning that they may need
to live in a home or facility that provides assistance with various life activities. Two percent have a
self-care disability. Six percent have an ambulatory disability, meaning that they may need
accommodations, such as a ramp, grab bars, or other improvements, to make their home more
accessible. Persons may have more than one disability, so there may be overlap between these
categories.

Developmental Disabilities
The persons with a disability category includes persons with developmental disabilities.
"Developmental disability" means a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years,
continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that
individual.” This term includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and disabling
conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that
required for individuals with mental retardation, but does not include other handicapping conditions
that are solely physical in nature.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                        10.II-20

While the US Census reports on mental disabilities, which include developmental disabilities, the
Census does not identify the subpopulation that has a developmental disability. The California
Department of Developmental Services (DDS) maintains data regarding people with developmental
disabilities, defined as those with severe, life-long disabilities attributable to mental and/or physical
impairments. The DDS data is reported by zip code, so the data reflects a larger area than the City of
Oakley. The DDS data indicates that approximately 370 developmentally disabled persons reside in
zip code 95461 (Table 10-40). Of these persons, 128 have special housing needs
(independent/supported living, community care facility, and intermediate care/skilled nursing
facility) as shown in Table 10-41 and 242 live at home with a parent, guardian, or foster parent.
                                                                    Table 10-40

Summary of the Housing Needs of the Disabled
In 2010, approximately 10 percent of Oakley’s population reported having a disability. The 2008-
2011 ACS indicates that 2,586 (24.5 percent) of households had one or more disabled members.
Applying this figure to the RHNA, approximately 286 new households will have one or more
disabled members, including developmentally disabled members, during the 2014-2022 planning
period. Not all households with a disabled member require housing that differs from the typical
single family home or apartment. However, some disabled persons may require assistance with self-
care or life tasks or may need housing that has improvements that make the home accessible.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                                       10.II-21

                                                                   10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Housing units appropriate to accommodate physical, sensory, and/or developmental disabilities are
anticipated to be needed for at least half of disabled households.
e. Homeless Population
It is challenging to accurately count homeless populations, which include people living in vehicles
and in places not designed to be permanent housing (i.e., motels) in addition to those on the streets
and in shelters. The Contra Costa Inter-jurisdictional Council on Homelessness (CCICH) is charged
with providing a forum for communication about the implementation of Contra Costa County’s Ten
Year Plan to End Homelessness and providing advice and input on the operations of homeless
services, program operations, and program development efforts in Contra Costa County. The
CCICH Executive Committee is an Advisory Board to the Contra Costa Board of Supervisors in
issues relating to homelessness.
According to the 2013 homeless count results, there are an estimated 3,798 homeless persons in
Contra Costa County. Of the Countywide homeless population, approximately 2,448 are sheltered
and 1,350 are unsheltered. The 2013 homeless county identified 60 unsheltered homeless in
Oakley.
Countywide, approximately 29% of homeless individuals are chronically homeless while only 2% of
homeless families reported being chronically homeless. Countywide, subpopulations identified
during the 2013 homeless count included veterans (7%), severely mentally ill (19%), chronic
substance abuse (22%), and victims of domestic violence (12%).
Oakley is part of the Countywide Continuum of Care for homeless and special needs populations.
The 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan identified 1,461 beds, including emergency shelter, transitional
housing, and supportive housing, for homeless individuals and families.
There are no homeless or transitional shelters located in Oakley. The closest shelter is the East
County Shelter located in Antioch, which provides 20 year-round adult-only individual beds. In
addition, East County Transitional Housing in Antioch provides 70 year-round beds for families with
children. Shepherd’s Gate in Brentwood provides long-term supportive housing for up to 18 women
and children.
Based on the 2013 homeless count, the City has a need to provide shelter for up to 60 homeless
persons, including both individuals and families, at any given point in time.
f. Farm Workers
Farm workers are defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through permanent or
seasonal agricultural labor. In 2000, at most 91 persons, comprising of 0.6 percent of Oakley’s labor
force, were employed in agriculture (91 persons were employed in the agriculture, forestry, fishing
and hunting, and mining sector). It is assumed that only a small percentage of persons employed in
this industry are involved in active agricultural production and harvest.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                   10.II-22

                                                                   10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
g. Extremely Low Income Households
Though not a State-defined special needs group, extremely low income households have specific
needs based on their low income in comparison to housing costs. Extremely low income households
are defined as households earning 30 percent or less of the MFI. In accordance with Chapter 891,
Statutes of 2006 (AB 2634), cities must quantify the existing and projected extremely low income
households and analyze their needs. The 2006-2010 data provided in the ABAG Data Package
identified 1,060 extremely low income households (10.4 percent) in Oakley. Approximately 46%
(485) extremely low income households rent and 54% (575) own their home. .
Table 10-22 and 10-27 summarizes the extremely low income households with housing problems.
Approximately 77 percent of extremely low income households experience overpayment, with the
majority of these experience severe overpayment, and 78 percent have at least one type of housing
problem.
Housing types to accommodate the needs of extremely low income households include transitional
and supportive housing, single room occupancy units (SROs), multi-family rental housing, factory-
built housing, workforce housing, and mobile homes.

III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
A. GOVERNMENTAL RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
Governmental resources include programs that provide funds for housing-related activities, as well as,
incentives provided by the local jurisdiction for the provision of housing.
Governmental constraints are policies, standards, requirements and actions imposed by the government that
may have a negative impact on the development and provision of housing for a variety of income levels.
These constraints may include building codes, land use controls, growth management measures, development
fees, processing and permit procedures, and site improvement costs. State and federal agencies play a role in
the imposition of governmental constraints; however, these agencies are beyond the influence of local
government and are, therefore, not addressed in this analysis.
1. Land Use Controls
Land use controls include city-initiated General Plan policies, zoning regulations and standards, permit
processing requirements and development fees.
a. General Plan
The General Plan constitutes the highest-level policy document for the City of Oakley. The Land Use
Element of the General Plan identifies the location, distribution and density/intensity of the land use within
the City. Residential densities are measured in dwelling units per acre (du/ac).
The 2020 Oakley General Plan identifies eight land use designations that permit residential uses. Table 10-42
summarizes Oakley’s residential land use designations by total acreage and permitted density ranges.

According to the current General Plan, a total of 21,109 dwelling units are anticipated within the City’s
planning areas at build-out. As of 2013, the State Department of Finance (DOF) estimated 11,903
dwelling units exist in Oakley. This leaves a remaining capacity of 9,206 new dwelling units.
Depending on land costs, a range of densities may be necessary to contribute to a project’s affordability for

people at various income levels. The following densities are generally appropriate to accommodate
construction affordable to specific income levels are generally accepted by HCD:
•         Extremely-Low, Very-Low, and Low Income: 30 dwelling units per acre minimum in metropolitan
areas
•         Moderate Income: 5-20 dwelling units per acre minimum; the entry-level prices of new single family
homes are affordable to moderate income households in Oakley
•         Above-Moderate Income: Up to 11 dwelling units per acre
In addition to the generally accepted densities, Assembly Bill (AB) 2348 established “default” density
standards. If a local government has adopted density standards consistent with the established population
criteria, sites with those density standards are accepted as appropriate for accommodating the jurisdiction’s
share of regional housing need for lower-income households. Pursuant to AB 2348, Oakley is considered a
“metropolitan” jurisdiction with a “default” density of 30 dwelling units per acre.
b. Zoning Code
The Zoning Code is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan. It is designed to protect and
promote public health, safety and welfare, as well as to promote quality design and quality of life. The City of
Oakley’s residential zoning designations control both the use and development standards of each residential
parcel, thereby influencing the development of housing.
Table 10-43 summarizes permitted residential uses in residential districts. Single-family residential zoning
include eight districts: AL, R-6, R-7, R-10, R-12, R-15, R-20 and R-40. Single-family units are permitted as a
matter of right in all single-family residential districts. Multiple-family residential zones include the M-9, M-
12, M-17, and MH districts. Multiple-family buildings are permitted as a matter of right in multiple-family
residential districts. In addition, single-family dwellings are permitted as a matter of right in multiple-family
residential districts.
Residential uses are permitted in the SP-4 (Downtown Specific Plan) zoning district at a maximum density of
45 units per acre, but densities are determined on a case-by-case basis.
The Housing Plan includes a program to limit the development of single-family dwellings on sites zoned for
multifamily development (M-12, M-17, and higher) in order to ensure that the City has adequate sites to
accommodate a range of housing types.
Table 10-44 summarizes the development standards and requirements for each residential zone.

c. Parking Requirements
Table 10-45 summarizes residential parking requirements in Oakley. Parking requirements do not constrain
the development of housing directly. However, parking requirements may reduce the amount of available lot
area for residential development.
                                                             Table 10-45

                                                  additional off-street parking space shall be provided for a second
                                                  dwelling unit. This additional parking space may be uncovered and
                                                  compact, but may not block vehicular access to a parking space that
                                                  is required for the primary residence. The parking space shall be
                                                  outside the front yard setback.
                                                  The requirement for an additional parking space may be waved by
                                                  the Planning Commission if it finds that adequate on-street parking
                                                  is available adjacent to the property.

d. Downtown Specific Plan.
The Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) identifies two districts that accommodate mixed-use residential and
higher density residential uses: Downtown Core Area and Downtown Support Area. Residential densities
are determined on a case-by-case basis with a maximum density of 45 units/acre. DSP development
standards are summarized in Table 10-46 and parking requirements are identified in Table 10-47.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                                 10.III-6

The Downtown Specific Plan (SP-4) has three main subareas, the Downtown Core, the Downtown Support,
and the Residential Commercial Conversion Opportunity Area. The three subareas allow for residential uses
at different densities. The Downtown Core area allows for up to 45 dwelling units per acre with the approval
of a Conditional Use Permit. The Downtown Support area allows for residential uses with the approval of a
Conditional Use Permit; however the density is determined on as a case-by-case basis and in conjunction with
the areas shown on the Subarea Map. The Residential Commercial Conversion Opportunity Area also allows
for residential uses with the approval of a Conditional Use Permit; however the density is also determined on
as a case-by-case basis. In all instances, the City would require a comprehensive plan and analysis justifying
the proposed density in each of the subareas. Determining factors could include, but not fully encompass,
the location to services such as transit, schools and shopping, as well as where the project is located, the
densities in the immediate area, and compatibility with adjacent land uses.
e. East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan
The East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan (ECCSP) is an approximately 2,546-acre area within the City of
Oakley. The ECCSP identifies seven residential land use districts:
     •    Single Family Residential – Low: Maximum density of 2.3 units/acre;
     •    Single Family Residential – Medium: Maximum density of 3.8 units/acre;
     •    Single Family Residential – High: Maximum density of 5.5 units/acre;
     •    Multi-Family Residential – Low (detached): Maximum density of 9.6 units/acre;
     •    Multi-Family Residential – Low (attached): Maximum density of 9.0 units/acre;
     •    Multi-Family Residential – High: Maximum density of 12.0 units/acre; and
     •    Mobile Home: Maximum density of 9.6 units/acre.
Development standards, including minimum lot sizes, setbacks, building heights, and, for multifamily units,
maximum ground coverage (see Appendix B, Tables 2 and 3). The development standards accommodate
typical single family and multifamily development. Parking must be consistent with the requirements of the
Zoning Code. For multifamily high density projects, the provisions for 40% maximum site coverage for
buildings and 3-story building heights (maximum of 40 feet) accommodate approximately 25 to 30 units per
acre, which is higher than the maximum allowed density of 12.0 du/ac. The ECCSP identifies that the
maximum number of dwelling units may be exceeded pursuant to the Affordable Housing Overlay district,
Density Bonus, and Second Dwelling Units provisions of the Zoning Code.
f. Planned Unit Development District
The City defines a Planned Unit Development (P-1) District as a large-scale integrated development, infill
development, or a General Plan special area of concern, which would allow flexible regulations through
cohesive design procedures. The intent of the P-1 District is to allow diversification in the relationships of
buildings, structures and open spaces, ensure compatibility with surrounding land uses, and to ensure
substantial compliance with the General Plan and the intent of the Municipal Code. This is accomplished
through applying standards that satisfy the requirements of public health, safety and general welfare. The P-1
District specifically permits detached single family dwelling units and second units and also permits any land
uses included on an approved final development plan. This allows for a range of land uses and provides for
flexibility in determining the specific type of units and densities suitable for a proposed project or site
All site and building requirements, including yard, building height, lot coverage, and landscaping are
determined on a case-by-case basis based on the specific characteristics of the site and the need to provide

additional zoning control by establishing site specific conditions of approval and standards for a specific P-1
District.
g. Affordable Housing Overlay
The City of Oakley has established an Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) district. The AHO district applies
to areas zoned Multiple-Family High (MFH) and allows housing densities that exceed the maximum units per
acre otherwise allowed in the district, if development meets State density bonus criteria. Qualifying projects
must provide at least 10 percent of the total units of the housing development as target units affordable to
lower income households; or at least five percent of the total units of the housing development as target units
affordable to very low income households; or at least 10 percent of the total units of the housing development
as target units affordable to moderate income households; or senior citizen housing as defined and meeting
the requirements set forth in Government Code section 65915 and applicable state law; or as otherwise
specified by Government Code section 65915.
The AHO also modifies the multifamily development standards to compliment higher density housing
projects. Table 10-46 summarizes the development standards. All developments within the AHO district
must be consistent with the City of Oakley Residential Design Guidelines and Multifamily Residential Design
Guidelines. Following adoption of the 2009 Housing Element, the City updated the Section 9.1.410 of the
Zoning Ordinance to clarify that 24 du/acre is the base density for projects in the AHO and the maximum
density, inclusive of a density bonus, is 32.4 dwelling units per acre. The AHO provisions have been
improved, but it is not clear which zoning designations the AHO is consistent with as there is not an MFH
zoning designation. The Housing Plan includes a policy action to revise the Zoning Code to identify that the
AHO can be applied in any of multifamily districts and in the Specific Plan districts that allow multifamily
housing.

2. Density Bonus Ordinance
In order to encourage the construction of affordable housing developments for Very-Low and Low Income
households, and senior households, and in accordance with Section 65915 et seq. of the California
Government Code, the City of Oakley has adopted a Density Bonus Ordinance (Section 9.1.412 of the
Zoning Code). Upon request from the applicant, the City grants a density bonus to an applicant or developer
of a housing development, who agrees to provide the following:
•        At least 10 percent of the total units of the housing development as target units affordable to lower
income households; or
•        At least five percent of the total units of the housing development as target units affordable to very
low income households; or
•        Senior citizen housing as defined and meeting the requirements set forth in Government Code
Section 65915 and applicable state law; or
•        As otherwise specified by Government Code Section 65915.
a. General Density Bonus for Affordable Units
The City grants a density bonus for developments providing units affordable to and occupied by Very-Low
and Low Income persons and households. The project must have a minimum of five units and an
affordability covenant for at least 30 years. To determine the number of density bonus units granted, the City
follows the guidelines set forth in Government Code Section 65915.
b. Density Bonus for Senior Housing
As set forth in Government Code Section 65915 and other applicable State law, the Density Bonus
Ordinance provides for a density bonus for senior citizen housing that meet certain requirements.
c. Development Incentives
In addition to the density bonus, at least one other incentive identified in California Government Code 65915
must be provided to developers proposing housing developments that meet the required guidelines. The need
for incentives will vary for different housing developments and, thus, the allocation of incentives is
determined on a case-by-case basis. The additional incentives may include, but are not limited to, the
following:

3. Residential Care Facilities
A “residential care facility” is a resident-occupied dwelling, licensed by the State/County that provides
housing and care for children and/or adults on a full-time, live-in basis. Residential Care facilities with six or
fewer persons are permitted by right pursuant to State Law. While residential care facilities are permitted by
right pursuant to State law, the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not identify residential care facilities as an
allowed use and does not address residential care facilities that serve seven or more persons. The Housing
Plan includes a program to define residential care facilities in the Zoning Ordinance, to identify that
residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted by right in all residential districts, and to
identify permit requirements for residential care facilities that serve seven or more persons.
4. Emergency Shelters, Transitional and Supportive Housing and Single Room Occupancy
Units
Recent changes to State law (Senate Bill 2) require that cities identify sites that are adequately zoned for
emergency shelters and transitional housing. Additionally, cities must not unduly discourage or deter these
uses.
a. Emergency Shelters
There are no emergency shelters located in Oakley. The closest shelter is the East County Shelter located in
Antioch, which provides 20 year-round individual beds. Additionally, East County Transitional Housing in
Antioch provides 70 year-round family beds. The City of Oakley Zoning Code allows homeless shelters in
multiple-family zones with a use permit. There are no specific limitations or standards for development of
emergency shelters.
Senate Bill (SB) 2 requires that cities with an unmet need for emergency shelters allow these uses by right
without a conditional use or other discretionary permit. The identified zone(s) must have sufficient capacity
to accommodate the shelter need, and at a minimum provide capacity for at least one year-round shelter.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                            10.III-10

                                                                              10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
The Emergency shelters are permitted by right on the Civic Center site within the Downtown Core Zone
in the Downtown Specific Plan. The Civic Center site includes an undeveloped parcel that is used as
the City’s corporation yard. The corporation yard site is planned for development by the Downtown
Specific Plan and uses discussed for the site have included various civic and community-serving uses.
This 0.99-acre parcel has the capacity to accommodate an emergency shelter and the City is
supportive of locating an emergency shelter on the parcel. Development standards on this site allow
for maximum building heights of four floors/50 feet and floor area ratios of 1.0 would accommodate
a building of 24,000 – 43,124 square feet, which would allow for an emergency shelter of adequate
size to meet the City’s needs for unsheltered homeless persons. The Housing Plan includes a program to
identify a replacement site with zoning that meets the requirements of State law in the event that the
corporation yard site is approved for development with a use other than an emergency shelter.
b. Transitional     and Supportive Housing
Transitional housing is used exclusively by households at immediate risk of being homeless, or transitioning
from homelessness to permanent housing. State law defines transitional housing as buildings configured as
rental housing developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the termination of
assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined
future point in time, which shall be no less than six months.
There are no transitional shelters located in the City of Oakley; however, according to the City’s Zoning
Code, transitional shelters are permitted in multiple-family zones with a use permit as long as they are
consistent with Section 65008 of the California Government Code, which prohibits adverse discrimination in
land use decisions for residential developments based on race, sex, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin,
ancestry, lawful occupation, familial status, disability, age, the method of financing development, or intended
occupancy of the development by persons of lower income.
The Zoning Code does not define or include development standards or regulations for supportive housing.
State law defines supportive housing as housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target
population and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in
retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when
possible, work in the community.
The Zoning Code defines transitional and supportive housing consistent with the definitions in State law.
Transitional and supportive housing with six or fewer units is permitted by right in all single family residential
zones; a conditional use permit is required in all single family residential zones for transitional and supportive
housing serving seven or more persons. The multifamily residential zones only permit transitional shelters
with a conditional use permit and supportive housing is not addressed in the multifamily residential zones.
The requirement for a conditional use permit conflicts with State law, which requires that transitional and
supportive housing be permitted as a residential use, subject only to those requirements that apply to other
residential uses of the same type in the same zone. Further, supportive housing must be allowed in
multifamily residential zones as well as single family. The Housing Plan includes a program to amend the
Zoning Code to permit transitional and supportive housing as residential uses, subject only to those
requirements that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone, meaning that single
family dwelling units providing transitional and supportive housing are subject only to the requirements to
permit a single family dwelling and that multifamily housing providing transitional and supportive housing is
subject to the same requirements as a multifamily development.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                        10.III-11

                                                                               10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
c. Single Room Occupancy Units
Single room occupancy units (SROs) are small, one-room units occupied by a single individual, and may
either have shared or private kitchen and bathroom facilities. SROs can provide a valuable form of affordable
housing for lower- income individuals, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
Section 9.1.1218 of the Zoning Code defines single room occupancy as a facility providing dwelling units where
each unit has a minimum floor area of 150 square feet and a maximum floor area of 220 square feet. The units
may have kitchen or bathroom facilities and must be offered on a monthly basis or longer. SROs are allowed
with a conditional use permit in the General Commercial zone. Section 9.1.1218 establishes development
standards which address unit size, occupancy, common area, kitchen facilities, bathroom facilities, laundry
facilities, storage, accessibility, length of stay, management, and parking. The development standards are
appropriate for the type of development and are appropriate to ensure adequate facilities to serve SRO
residents.
5. Second Unit Ordinance
The City’s Second Unit Ordinance was adopted on July 14, 2003, and is intended to increase the supply of
smaller dwelling units and rental housing units by allowing second dwelling units to be developed on certain
lots which are zoned single-family residential use. The City of Oakley permits second dwelling units in the
AL, R-6, R-7, R-10, R-12, R-20 and R-40 districts provided certain requirements are met and subject to
ministerial review and approval by the Community Development Director. Second dwelling units must
comply with City design and development standards to ensure that they are compatible with existing
neighborhoods.
The City’s Second Unit Ordinance sets forth the criteria for second units including the definition of a second
unit, the maximum allowable square footage, and the development standards for these units. These criteria
do not pose a constraint to the development of second units. Criteria for second units include:
  •        No more than one additional dwelling unit is allowed on any one legal lot or parcel
  •        Construction of the second unit will not result in total structural lot coverage in excess of 40
  percent
  •        The total floor area of the second unit can not exceed 1,000 square feet on lots less than 10,000 square
  feet and can not exceed 1,200 square feet on lots 10,000 square feet or larger
  •        Second units must conform to setback requirements of the zoning district applicable to primary
  residence
  •        The second dwelling unit shall incorporate the same or similar architectural features as the primary
  residence
  •        Either the second unit or primary unit must be occupied by the property owner
6.         Housing for Persons with Disabilities
The U.S. Census Bureau defines persons with disabilities as those with a long-lasting physical, mental or
emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult for a person to do activities such as walking,
climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning or remembering. This condition can also impede a person from
being able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job or business.
a. Reasonable Accommodation Procedures
The provisions of SB 520 require municipalities to analyze potential and actual constraints upon the
development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities, and demonstrate local
Oakley General Plan                                                                                         10.III-12

                                                                              10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
efforts to remove governmental constraints that hinder the locality from meeting the need for housing for
persons with disabilities. Cities are required to include programs that remove constraints and provide
reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons with disabilities.
The City implements reasonable accommodation procedures and a streamlined permit review process for
reasonable accommodation requests through the City’s Building Official. Requests may be submitted in
person at City Hall or through the City’s website.
The City Building Code and Zoning Code were analyzed to identify any constraints to housing development
for persons with disabilities. As described under b (Zoning and Land Use Regulations), the Zoning Code
does not address residential care homes (group homes) or residential care facilities, which may result in
limiting the types of housing available to disabled persons. The City will continue to monitor its land use
regulations for possible governmental constraints to housing for persons with disabilities. The Housing Plan
includes a program to continue to implement the City’s reasonable accommodation procedures and to review
changes to the Zoning Code, Building Code, and other relevant documents to ensure that future updates do
not introduce constraints to persons with disabilities.
b. Zoning and Other Land Use Regulations
The City has not identified any zoning or other land-use regulatory practices that could discriminate against
persons with disabilities. However, the Zoning Code does not clearly address residential care facilities or
community care facilities, which may impede the availability of such housing for these individuals.
Examples of the ways in which the City facilitates housing for persons with disabilities through its regulatory
and permitting procedures are:
•         Supportive single-family housing for six or fewer persons is a permitted use in single-family
residential zones.
•         All multiple-family complexes are required to provide handicapped parking spaces, depending on
the size of the development. The City is flexible and works with the developers of special needs housing and
will reduce parking requirements if the applicant can demonstrate a reduced need for parking. The City has no
separate restrictions or development standards for group homes or other special needs housing.
•         The City of Oakley allows, as a matter of right, residential care facilities for six or fewer persons in
all residential zoning districts. Group care facilities for more than six persons are permitted subject to a
conditional use permit in residential districts. While the City allows these uses, the Zoning Code is silent in
regards to residential care facilities which will be addressed as described in the Housing Plan.
•         The City of Oakley holds public hearings for every change or amendment to any ordinance, policy,
program, procedure, funding, or other similar action. There is no public hearing for the establishment of a
group home for six or less persons. Requests for group homes of more than six persons are determined at a
noticed public hearing before the Planning Commission. Property owners within 300 feet of the site are
noticed and may attend and comment.
•         Recognizing that some persons with disabilities may require the assistance of specially trained
persons who live with the disabled persons, the Zoning Code does not differentiate between related

                                                                            10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
and unrelated persons occupying the same residential unit.
•         The City works with a Certified Access Specialist to ensure that development plans meet ADA
requirements.
7. Farm Worker and Employee Housing
State law requires that employee housing providing accommodations for six or fewer employees shall be
deemed a single-family structure permitted in residential zones. Further, state law requires that employee
housing shall not be included within the definition of a boarding house, rooming house, hotel, dormitory, or
other similar term that implies that the employee housing is a business run for profit or differs in any other
way from a family dwelling. No conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be
required of employee housing that serves six or fewer employees that is not required of a family dwelling of
the same type in the same zone.
State law also requires that employee housing consisting of no more than 36 beds in a group quarters or 12
units or spaces designed for use by a single family or household shall be deemed an agricultural land use
designation and shall not be deemed a use that implies that the employee housing is an activity that differs in
any other way from an agricultural use. State law requires that no conditional use permit, zoning variance, or
other zoning clearance shall be required of this employee housing that is not required of any other agricultural
activity in the same zone. The permitted occupancy in employee housing in an agricultural zone shall include
agricultural employees who do not work on the property where the employee housing is located.
Agricultural uses are allowed in the Limited Agricultural (AL), Agriculture Preserve (A-4), and Delta
Recreation (DR) Districts. These districts do not currently accommodate farm labor and employee housing
as a permitted use, as required by state law. Chapter VI, Housing Plan, includes a policy action to revise the
Zoning Code to permit farm labor and employee housing as required by state law.
8. Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Oakley’s building and safety codes are adopted to preserve public health and safety, and ensure
the construction of safe and decent housing. These codes and standards also have the potential to increase
the cost of housing construction or maintenance.
a. Building Codes
The City of Oakley has adopted the 2010 California Building Standards Administrative Code, 2010 Edition;
California Building Code, 2010 Edition; California Residential Code, 2010 Edition; California Electrical
Code, 2010 Edition; California Mechanical Code, 2010 Edition; California Plumbing Code, 2010 Edition;
California Energy Code, 2010 Edition; California Fire Code, 2010 Edition; California Green Building
Standards Code, 2010 Edition (mandatory provisions only), which are based on the 2009 International
Building Code and establishes construction standards for all residential buildings. The codes have been
adopted without amendment. The City Council regularly reviews the latest edition of the California
Building Standards Code and typically adopts the state-wide code with changes or modifications as are
reasonable and necessary because of local climatic, geological, or topographical conditions, or as otherwise
permitted by State law. The regulations set forth are designed to ensure the safety and welfare of Oakley’s
residents.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                       10.III-14

                                                                              10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
b. Americans with Disabilities Act
The Federal Fair Housing Act of 1998 (FHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) are federal laws
intended to assist in providing safe and accessible housing. ADA provisions include requirements for a
minimum percentage of units in new developments to be fully accessible for persons with physical disabilities.
Compliance with these regulations may increase the cost of housing construction as well as the cost of
rehabilitating older units, which may be required to comply with current codes. However, the enforcement of
ADA requirements is not at the discretion of the City, but is mandated under federal law.
c. Code Enforcement
The City conducts code enforcement activities on a complaint basis in response to reports from residents and
other community members. When a complaint is received the City inspects the property and determines
whether there is a code violation. If there is a code violation, the City sends a letter to the property owner
informing them that they have 10 days to correct the violation. If the violation is not abated within the 10
days, a second notice is sent informing the property owner that the violation must be abated within 10 days
or the City will abate the violation and bill the owner. If the City abates the violation, the property owner has
30 days to pay for the abatement process or a lien will be placed on the property. Code enforcement activities
work to preserve the City’s existing housing stock.
The City of Oakley continues the Community Service Program to educate residents and business owners
about municipal codes. Building code, weed and trash abatement code, and abandoned vehicle code
information are part of the Community Service Program curriculum. In addition to providing code
enforcement education, the Community Service Program is a resource for residents and businesses, providing
information on programs and services offered to Oakley residents by other agencies.
9. Residential Design Guidelines
The City of Oakley’s Residential Design Guidelines apply to both single-family and multiple-family residential
units. The guidelines are intended to aid project developers, design professionals, City staff, and decision
makers in the review of the design of development to ensure consistent quality while supporting flexibility.
Parameters include emphasizing entryways, deemphasized garages, using appropriate window forms, varying
roof styles, and emphasizing the appropriate use of trim, materials, and colors. While there are no cost
provisions within the guidelines, the purpose of these design standards is not to be cost prohibitive but help
developers during the initial design process.
In order to similarly assist project developers in the design of multiple-family projects and help the City
achieve the quality of multiple-family product that will enhance the community, the City will adopt design
guidelines for multiple-family development. Program 10.2.C of the General Plan incorporates the following
general parameters for multiple-family design guidelines:
•        Sufficient outdoor privacy for each unit (e.g., patios, decks)
•        Covered off-street parking
•        Parking away from the primary access street screened with landscaping
•        Assurance of proper site and building maintenance
•        Segmentation of building mass into smaller units, including one-story elements if adjacent to
Oakley General Plan                                                                                        10.III-15

                                                                               10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
single-story residential development
•        Pitched and varied rooflines
•        Functional and accessible interior site open space
•        Recreational areas for children when appropriate
•        Easily identifiable and sheltered entrances to units
•        Energy efficient design
•        On-site management for complexes over 15 units
•        Design that discourages features such as large blank walls and monotonous color schemes
•        On-site facilities to serve residents, including community centers, recreational facilities and similar
amenities as appropriate to the proposed complex and in consideration of proximity to existing amenities
These criteria would not pose a significant constraint to the development of both multiple-family market rate
complexes and affordable complexes as these requirements are generally practiced in the design of both types
of multiple-family developments. The implementation of these guidelines may result in a higher project cost
to multiple-family development by requiring the use of more expensive materials, or incorporating amenities
such as recreational and community facilities, but will result in the reduction of design cost by assisting the
developers in the understanding of the City’s design requirements. The objective of implementing these
guidelines is to assist the developer in the City’s desire to have aesthetically pleasing and sustainable multiple-
family projects. The City has developed, but not adopted the Multiple-Family Residential Design Guidelines.
Currently, the design guidelines are utilized in the review of multi-family projects, but are not regulatory
standards. The Planning Commission has recently been disbanded and the City Council absorbed the duties
of the Planning Commission. The City Council reviews and approves design review applications for multi-
family projects unless the project is a qualifying affordable housing project, in which case design review is
completed at the staff level.
10. Development Fees
Various development and permit fees are charged by the City and other agencies to cover administrative
processing costs associated with development. These fees ensure quality development and the provision of
adequate services. Often times, development fees are passed through to renters and homeowners in the
price/rent of housing, thus affecting the affordability of housing.
Tables 10-48 and 10-49 summarize the fees the City collects related to residential development. It is noted
that the City has a fee incentive program in place through June 2015 to encourage in-fill development of
residential subdivisions. The fees shown in Tables 10-48 and 10-49 represent the full fees without any as the
reduction incentive will end 6 months into the 8-year planning period for this document.

Table 10-49 summarizes the estimated cost of fees for a single family home, a 40-unit residential subdivision,
and a 40-unit multifamily project. Total fees for a 2,000 s.f. single family home are approximately $59,444
while fees per unit for a 50-home subdivision (average home size of 2,000 s.f.) are $59,722 per unit. Fees per
unit for a 50-unit multifamily project with an average unit size of 950 s.f. are $50,4401 per unit. Fees for
single family homes are similar to neighboring jurisdictions while fees for multi-family development are
higher than neighboring jurisdictions. While the City generally has reduced impact fees (traffic, parks, and
public facilities fees) for multifamily development compared to single family development, some outside
agencies (water district, sanitary district, and schools) serving Oakley do not provide for a reduction in
multifamily fees. The City also provides a reduced fee structure for senior housing and for second units. The
City’s fees are generally comparable to fees of other regional jurisdictions.
As shown in Table 10-49, the majority of fees (60 percent of single family fees and 65 percent of multifamily
fees) collected for development are for outside agencies. These outside agencies provide services necessary
for health and public safety, particularly water, sewer, and school services and the City does not have the
jurisdiction to reduce these outside fees.
It is noted that the Regional Transportation Development Impact Mitigation Fee is currently discounted;
however, Table 10-48 reflects the full fee as the fee reduction is anticipated to end in 2015. The Regional
Transportation Fee payment goes to completion of the new State Route 4, providing for regional funding
assistance with the much-needed bypass. When a residential development project falls within the boundaries
of the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Community Conservation Plan
(HCP/NCCP) inventory area, additional fees may apply. The HCP/NCCP provides an effective framework
to protect natural resources in Eastern Contra Costa County, while improving and streamlining the
environmental permitting process for impacts on endangered species. The HCP/NCCP provides for
comprehensive species, wetlands, and ecosystem conservation and contributes to the recovery of endangered
species in northern California. HCP/NCCP fees are applied to development projects impacting potential
habitat and are one option for mitigating impacts to, or incidental taking of, State and federally listed
threatened and endangered species (under the Endangered Species Act and California Endangered Species
Act.) The HCP/NCCP fee varies by project, depending on the location of the parcel and habitat type.
The City has worked to reduce fees to the extent feasible. The City continues to see significant levels of
residential development, including lower income housing, and the fees have not posed a constraint to date. It
is noted that Chapter VI, Housing Plan, includes a program to regularly review development fees and to take
appropriate actions to revise fees, if appropriate. For fees that are outside of the City’s control, the program
requires the City to review the fees and to request fee reductions, to the extent feasible, from the
administering agency.

11. Local Processing and Permit Procedures
Applications for development permits are made in writing to the Community Development Department.
Application processing times vary depending on the permit being requested. In addition, some planning
applications require public hearings. On average, development permits are processed in less than three
months. Overall, development permit approval processing in Oakley does not create any unnecessary delays
or increases to the cost of housing.
The City is required to determine if an application is complete within 30 days of receipt. Once deemed
complete, application processing begins. Applications are reviewed for consistency with the General Plan
and Zoning Code, and conformance with design standards. In general, applications require 45 days for staff
review and 90 days, if Planning Commission approval is required. A project requiring City Council approval
will generally require an additional 90 days. An approved development plan will remain in effect for three
years. All residential development in the City require either Planning Commission and/or City Council
approval, except for single-family additions and the addition of second units, which only require staff review.

Applications are submitted to the Planning Department, which then reviews them for their completeness.
Once the application is determined to be complete, it goes before the Planning Commission for review and
approval. Final Maps for subdivisions are approved by the City Council once the Planning Commission has
approved the Tentative Subdivision Map. The process can take six months to a year for approval.
The Planning Commission has recently been disbanded and the City Council absorbed the duties of the
Planning Commission. Multi-family projects are permitted by-right in the Multiple Family Residential Districts
(M-9, M-12, and M-17) and the Mobile Home Residential District (MH). However, the City Council reviews
and approves design review applications for multi-family projects unless the project is a qualifying
affordable housing project, in which case design review is completed at the staff level.
Certain applications for development are subject to the requirements of the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA) and require the preparation of an environmental document (i.e., environmental impact report or
mitigated negative declaration) before a project can be approved. The requirement to prepare an
environmental document can substantially lengthen the development review process, sometimes taking up to
one year to obtain project approval. However, the cost associated with preparing an environmental document
is not considered to disproportionately constrain residential development in Oakley.
As described under Section 10 (Development Fees), some development projects may need to comply with
outside agency requirements, including payment of applicable fees.
The costs associated with development project review will vary between projects. Oakley utilizes an efficient
and comprehensive approach towards development review and permitting that allows for quick response to
developer applications. In addition, the City utilizes many practices such as expedited application processing,
reducing costs, and clarification of the process to developers and homeowners to minimize City impacts on
the development process. Increased development costs resulting from the City’s development review and
permitting process are not considered to constrain housing development.
Table 10-50 illustrates the typical development timelines for various applications and permits.

                                                                             10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
12. Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
a. Environmental Constraints
Environmental hazards affecting housing units include geologic and seismic conditions, which provide the
greatest threat to the built environment. The following hazards may impact future development of residential
units in the City.
i.        Seismic Haz ards
Oakley is bordered by the San Joaquin River side of the Delta to the north, to the east by unincorporated
areas of Contra Costa County, to the south by the City of Brentwood, and to the west by the City of Antioch.
The two major seismic faults located near the City of Oakley are the San Andreas and Antioch Faults. The
City of Oakley is underlain by the Brentwood Fault, which is inferred active on the basis of scattered small
magnitude earthquakes near the trace of the fault. Other inferred active faults just west of Oakley are the
Davis and Antioch Faults.
As required by the State of California, the Oakley General Plan contains policies regarding geologic and
seismic hazards within the Health and Safety Element. The goal of the City of Oakley General Plan seismic
hazard policies is to protect human life, reduce the potential for serious injuries, and minimize the risk of
property losses from the effects of earthquakes, including fault rupture, ground shaking, and liquefaction -
induced ground failure. The following policies are included in the Health and Safety Element:
•         Recognize that a severe earthquake hazard exists and reflect this recognition in the City’s
development review and other programs
•         Include a thorough evaluation of geologic-seismic and soils conditions at risk in all significant land
use decisions (General Plan Amendment, Rezoning, etc., affecting ten acres or more)
•         Require the design of structures for human occupancy for satisfactory performance under earthquake
conditions
•         Prohibit the erection of critical structures and facilities whose loss would substantially affect the
public safety or the provision of needed services, in areas where there is a high risk of severe damage in
the event of an earthquake unless appropriate engineering and construction practices are applied to ensure
structural stability
A major earthquake could have the potential to cause the failure of the dam structure at the Los Vaqueros
Reservoir south of Oakley. Upon failure, water would spill out quickly and head generally northeast to the
Delta through low-lying land. However, according to a 1995 ABAG Hazard Map, Oakley is not in a dam
inundation area.
ii. Soils
The City of Oakley is mostly made up of lowland soil association soils, with some tidal flat-delta-marsh
lowlands soils in the northeast corner of the City. Physical and chemical characteristics of soils may limit
construction/development. The following soil types are within areas currently designated for urban
development in Oakley:
Lowland soil association. Slowly to very slowly permeable, highly expansive and corrosive with slight erosion
hazard.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                        10.III-21

                                                                              10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Tidal flat-delta-marsh lowland. Highly expansive, very highly corrosive, and moderately to slowly permeable.
Class II Delhi sand. Excessively drained soils where runoff is slow or very slow.
These soils vary moderately regarding erosion potential, drainage, and suitability for fill.
iii. Flooding
Substantial areas within the City are subject to flooding, especially areas along the shoreline of the Delta and
northeast of the Contra Costa Canal. The Marsh Creek area, the majority of the City’s shoreline areas, and the
entire Cypress Lakes Sphere of Influence (SOI) area are within the 100-year floodplain. The City has
established policies and programs within the General Plan to mitigate hazards from potential flooding,
therefore, flooding is not considered a constraint on the development.. The goal of the Flood Hazards
section of the Health and Safety Element is to protect public safety and minimize the risk to life and property
from flooding. Policies regarding flood hazards include:
•         Applications for development at urban or suburban densities in 100-year floodplain areas where
there is a serious risk to life and property shall demonstrate appropriate solutions or be denied
•         In mainland areas along the creeks and bays affected by water backing up into the watercourse, it
shall be demonstrated prior to development that adequate protection exist through levee protection or change
of elevation.
In addition, the following policies must be considered in areas prone to flooding:
•         Buildings in urban development near the shoreline of the Delta and in flood-prone areas shall be
protected from flood dangers, including consideration of rising sea levels
•         Habitable areas of structures near the shoreline of the Delta and in flood-prone areas shall be sited
above the highest water level expected during the life of the project, or shall be protected for the expected life
of the project by levees of an adequate design
•         Rights-of-way for levees protecting inland areas from tidal flooding shall be sufficiently wide on
the upland side to allow for future levee widening to support additional levee height
•         Review flooding policies in the General Plan every five years in order to incorporate any new
scientific findings regarding the potential for flooding and projected increases in sea levels
•         Review flooding policies as they relate to properties designated by FEMA as within the 100-year
floodplain
•         Development proposals near the shoreline of the Delta and within flood-prone areas shall be
reviewed by the Flood Control District, as an advisory agency, prior to approval by the City
iv. T oxic and H az ardous Wastes
Heavy industrial land uses centered in northwest Oakley have the potential to present significant risk to
public safety. Potential hazards include explosion and flammability of petroleum products and other
chemicals, and chemical toxicity. The former DuPont Chemical Plant was located in northwest Oakley;
however, the site has since closed and DuPont is in the process cleaning up the site. The presence hazardous
materials within Oakley poses a potential safety hazard.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                       10.III-22

                                                                              10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Pipelines for the transportation of natural gas, crude oil, and refined petroleum products pass through
Oakley, including residential and commercial areas. The public safety hazard from a pipeline break would
depend on the proximity of the accident to populated areas, as well as the nature of the event that produced
it.
There are several active gas and oil wells in Oakley, most of which are far from populated areas of the City.
Although there is the risk of a well catching on fire, such incidents have been very few and the risk of such a
fire causing a general disaster is remote.
To provide protection from hazards associated with the use, transport, treatment, and disposal of hazardous
substances, the City has developed the following policies:
•         Hazardous waste releases from both private companies and public agencies shall be identified and
eliminated.
•         Storage of hazardous materials and wastes shall be strictly regulated.
•         Secondary contaminant and periodic examination shall be required for all storage of toxic materials.
•         Industrial facilities shall be constructed and operated in accordance with up-to-date safety and
environmental protection standards.
•         Industries which store and process hazardous materials shall provide a buffer zone between the
installation and the property boundaries sufficient to protect public safety. The adequacy of the buffer
zone shall be determined by the Community Development Department.
v.        Fire Haz ards
The City of Oakley receives fire protection from the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District (ECCFPD).
The ECCFPD covers all of Oakley and the area to the east of Oakley north of Delta Road, west of Byron
Highway, and south of the San Joaquin River channel, as well as other areas in the East County previously
served by the East Diablo and Bethel Island Fire Protection Districts.
The ECCFPD provides service to structural, wildland, vehicle, and miscellaneous exterior fires; vehicle
accidents involving disentanglement and extrication; medical emergencies and hazardous materials incidents.
The District currently has one fire station, Station 93, serving the City of Oakley, as well as other stations
serving areas outside Oakley.
A fire hazard severity scale has been devised which characterizes areas throughout the County by the number
of days of moderate, high and extreme fire hazard. The City of Oakley is entirely within the boundaries of
critical Fire Weather Class 3, which correlates to 9½ or more days per year of moderate, high and extreme fire
hazard. The Class 3 category is the highest in the County, with Class 1 having less than one day per year, and
Class 2 having one to 9½ days per year.
In order to promote a high level of emergency preparedness and protect public health and safety in the event
of a natural or human-caused disaster, the City has developed the following policies in the Growth and
Management Element of the General Plan:
•         Promote and encourage the high service level of fire protection services within Oakley.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                        10.III-23

                                                                                     10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
•            Require that new development pay its fair share of costs for new fire protection facilities and
services.
•            Identify needed upgrades to fire facilities and equipment during project environmental review and
planning activities.
•            Incorporate analysis of optimum fire and emergency service access into circulation system design to
maximize the effectiveness of existing and proposed fire protection facilities.
•            Require special fire protection measures in high-risk uses (i.e., mid-rise buildings, and those
developments where hazardous materials are used and/or stored) as conditions of approval.
•            Require the provision of fire fighting equipment access to open space areas in accordance with the
Fire Protection Code and to all future development in accordance with Fire Access Standards.
vi. N oise
According to the Noise Element of the Oakley General Plan, there are no obvious sources of disruptive noise
in the City. Ambient noise can be heard, especially in those areas adjacent to major highways, intersections,
and rail lines.
As development occurs, additional noise disturbance will emerge as a temporary impact of construction. The
City is committed to imposing “Best Management Practices” on all development and construction in the City.
This may include limiting the hours of construction to avoid disruption during normal sleep hours. I n
a d d i t i o n , t h e d e v e l o p m e n t o f n e w neighborhoods may unintentionally create situations where new
residents are introduced to existing noise conditions. However, proper land use practices will minimize the
proximate placement of conflicting uses. Sound-walls can minimize many of these impacts, though land use
practices will more effectively address the true issue. By recognizing the impacts of noise, the City can
effectively address any proposed sources of noise or noise conflicts as they arise.
vii. V egetation and Wildlife H abitat
Vegetation within the Oakley area includes agricultural and ruderal fields, perennial and seasonal marsh,
orchards, riparian habitat, and landscaped (developed) vegetation communities.
The General Plan includes policies aimed at encouraging the preservation of important ecological and
biological resources. The General Plan encourages the development of open space uses in an ecologically
sensitive manner and the preservation and enhancement of the natural characteristics of the San Joaquin
Delta and Dutch Slough in a manner that encourages public access. In addition, an effort should be made to
preserve and expand stream corridors in Oakley, restoring natural vegetation where feasible.
viii. Rare and E ndangered Species
According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service species list for the City’s representative USGS quadrangle,
there are numerous special status plant and animal species known or expected to occur in Oakley. The HCP/NCCP
conservation strategy will mitigate the impacts to the HCP/NCCP’s covered species and contribute to recovery of
these species (see Section 10. Development Fee for more detail).
Special-status plant species including Delta mudwort, Mason’s lilaeopsis, rose mallow, and Suisun marsh aster
have the highest potential to occur within the City. In general, habitat for these species includes the marsh
habitat along the northern border of City.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                                10.III-24

                                                                            10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
One invertebrate species, curved-foot hygrotus diving beetle has the highest potential to occur within Oakley.
Habitat for this species in the area includes the sloughs.
California red-legged frog, San Joaquin coachwhip, Giant garter snake, California horned lizard, silvery legless
lizard, and Northwestern pond turtle have the highest potential to occur in the City. Generally, these species
occur in aquatic habitats (marshes and sloughs), with the exception of the horned and legless lizards, which
may occur in association with sandy soils.
Special-status mammal species that have the highest potential to occur in the City include San Joaquin kit fox,
San Joaquin pocket mouse, and several species of bats. Generally, the pocket mouse and kit fox could occur
in the open upland habitats in Oakley, and bats in the upland areas closer to water.
Special-status avian species including California black rail, Suisun song sparrow, tricolored blackbird, species
of herons, ibis, egrets, mountain plover, Greater sandhill crane, Swainson’s hawk, western burrowing owl, and
other raptors including ferruginous hawk and Cooper’s hawk have the highest potential to occur in the City.
These species could potentially occur in undeveloped portions of Oakley.
ix. Agricultural Lands
Oakley has historically been an agricultural community, with a wide variety of agricultural crops. While much
of the land used for agriculture has been developed into urban uses, there are remaining private parcels that
continue in agricultural production. These agricultural areas help to preserve the traditional rural character of
the community, maintain open space, and reduce congestion within the City. While the City recognizes the
historic role of agriculture within the Oakley community and supports continued agriculture, the transition
from agriculture to urban uses limits the potential for large-scale commercial agriculture within Oakley.
b.        Infrastructure Constraints
i.        Water
The Diablo Water District (DWD) provides water service to Oakley, and parts of Bethel Island and
Knightsen. DWD’s water supply comes from a commitment of 30 million gallons per day (MGD) from the
Contra Costa Water District, a public water agency, which delivers water to 450,000 people in central and
eastern Contra Costa County. CCWD provides water for irrigation and industry with a full commitment from
the Central Valley Project of 174 MGD. DWD’s commitment from CCWD is for “normal” years, though it
can be less during drought years.
The District's raw water supply is from surface water from the Contra Costa Canal, which obtains water from
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta at the Rock Slough intake. This water is then stored in Los Vaqueros
Reservoir to improve the water quality, minimize seasonal water quality variations, and provide emergency
storage. The Los Vaqueros Reservoir has a capacity of 100,000 acre-feet of storage (32,600 MG).
All surface water is treated at the Randall-Bold Water Treatment Plant (RBWTP), which was completed in
1992 and is jointly owned by DWD and CCWD. The RBWTP has an initial capacity of 40 MGD with
expansion capability to 80 MGD. DWD has a treated water storage capacity of 12.8 MG. The ultimate
storage capacity required within DWD's sphere of influence is 28.8 MG.
Historically, due to deteriorating water quality, DWD utilized wells only for emergency purposes. To increase
supply reliability, provide operational flexibility and meet future needs, DWD has embarked on a Well
Utilization Program to locate a better supply of groundwater in the greater Oakley Area. The Well
Oakley General Plan                                                                                       10.III-25

                                                                                10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
Utilization Program would allow DWD to reduce its surface water supply purchases from CCWD and delay
purchase of additional RBWTP capacity because groundwater could be used to help meet high water
demands in the summer. In 2006, DWD completed the first phase of this project which consists of a well and
pump station in Glen Park in the City of Oakley; a blending facility at the RBWTP; and an 18-inch diameter,
18,250-foot-long pipeline that conveys water from the Glen Park well to the blending facility. There are two
more phases proposed which include two additional wells and a groundwater monitoring program.
The DWD Urban Water Management Plan identified an existing water demand of 1,816 million gallons (MG)
in 2010 and projected that water deliveries would increase to 5,572 MG by 2035, based on buildout land uses
and adopted General Plans of the jurisdictions served by DWD. DWD’s supply sources in 2010 provided
3,074 MG, which was more than adequate to serve the existing demand. By 2035, DWD has planned to
develop additional supply sources for a total supply of 6,651 MG, which is adequate to accommodate
projected demand. It is noted that in order for development in the East Cypress Corridor area to be served
by DWD through water purchased from CCWD, projects in the area would need to go through the Central
Valley Project place of use process with the US Bureau of Reclamation. However, the City’s RHNA is less
than the buildout conditions projected within the City’s General Plan and, as such, is within growth
projections used by DWD to plan for water service to Oakley. Adequate water supplies exist or are planned
to meet the needs of Oakley.
According to the City’s General Plan, Oakley can supply water service to all areas within the City limits.
Currently, existing infrastructure is available to sites identified in the vacant land survey. Additionally, Oakley
will continue to meet its future demands through programs such as the Well Utilization Program.
ii. Sewer
The Ironhouse Sanitary District (ISD) provides wastewater service to Oakley, Bethel Island and
unincorporated areas of eastern Contra Costa County. The City of Oakley and its Sphere of Influence (SOI)
areas are entirely within ISD’s boundary. The wastewater services involve the transmission of wastewater
from residential, commercial and light industry to a treatment facility and the final disposal of the wastewater
and residual waste solids.
The wastewater system is composed of collection, treatment, and effluent recycling facilities. ISD has
recognized that the collection and treatment facilities must be expanded to meet future requirements. The
daily flow is approximately 2.6 MGD and, as of 2009, the treatment system capacity was 3.0 MGD. ISD is
expanding its capacity to 4.3 MGD with the opening of a new treatment plant in 2011.
According to the General Plan, ISD has estimated a future potential wastewater flow of 8.0 MGD within its
SOI. ISD is proposing to upgrade and increase both its wastewater treatment capacity and effluent application
area to meet future wastewater service needs and projected effluent discharge water quality requirements. This
increased capacity will be in phases until the ultimate build-out is reached. In order to meet future
potential wastewater flow, ISD is proposing to expand their wastewater treatment plant. This expansion is
currently under environmental review.
In 2007, ISD updated the Sewer Master Plan. The SMP evaluates the capacity needs of ISD and identifies
capital improvement projects. The SMP anticipates buildout of the areas it serves based on General Plans
and similar document. The SMP anticipates future dry weather flows of 8.63 MGD and wet weather flows of
10.7 MGD. ISD’s Capital Improvements Program is regularly updated and plans for expansion of
wastewater treatment and conveyance facilities to keep pace with new development.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                          10.III-26

                                                                              10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
In 1991, ISD prepared a Wastewater Facilities Expansion Plan (ISD Facilities Plan) that outlined the
recommended treatment and effluent recycling projects necessary to meet the projected service demand.
Since completion of the ISD Facilities Plan, the District has continued to refine future wastewater flow
projections and proposed facilities plans and prepares a Capital Improvements Program and annually updates
its 5-year strategic plan. According to the General Plan, development within Oakley will not exceed ISD’s
planned maximum capacity limits.
13. East Cypress Corridor Annexation
In 2002, the Oakley City Council adopted the strategic goal of annexing the East Cypress Corridor area. In
February 2004, the City determined that a specific plan should be prepared for the East Cypress Corridor
area. As a result, the City authorized the preparation of the East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan for the
development of approximately 2,546 acres of land in this area. An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was
prepared for the East Cypress Corridor Plan and was certified by City Council on March 13, 2006. On the
same date, the City Council adopted the East Cypress Specific Plan, related General Plan Amendments, and
CEQA findings for the approvals.
In April 2006, the EIR certification was challenged by the Greenbelt Alliance, who filed a petition for writ of
mandate. On August 24, 2007, the Superior Court determined that the EIR was legally deficient and entered
a judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate. In compliance, the City rescinded their certification and
authorized the preparation of a Supplemental EIR to address the specific legal deficiencies the Court had
identified in its judgment and decision.
The City of Oakley issued a Notice of Preparation and Initial Study for the Supplemental EIR on October 26,
2007. On August 21, 2008, the Draft Supplemental EIR for the East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan was
published for public review. The public review period was from September 5, 2008 through October 24,
2008. The City Council will conduct a public hearing on the matter on March 10, 2009.
For the purposes of the RHNA analysis, the annexation was not incorporated into the assessment of vacant
land for this Housing Element period.
14. ON AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS
When developing land, the City may require the developer to dedicate land, construct, or pay fees to provide
necessary on and off-site improvements. Land dedication, site improvements or fees may be required to
provide adequate sanitary sewer and water service to a project, to make necessary transportation
improvements, and to provide other infrastructure to the project. In addition, the City may require the
payment for various offsite improvements as part of project mitigation measures (e.g., payment towards an
offsite traffic signal). Developers of new residential projects are also required to construct all onsite streets,
sidewalks, curb, gutter, and affected portions of offsite arterials. The cost for site improvements varies from
project to project, based on the specific location and existing infrastructure. For infill projects where
infrastructure may already be available, there may be a need to upgrade and/or expand the existing
improvements to serve new residential development.
Road classifications and standards are found in the City’s General Plan Circulation Element. They are as
follows:
•         Major Arterial – 4 or more lanes, 120 foot right-of-way
Oakley General Plan                                                                                          10.III-27

                                                                            10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
•         Minor Arterial – 2 lanes, 76 foot right of way
•         Collector – 2 lanes, 70-85 foot right–of-way
•         Local Street – 2 lanes, 60 foot right-of-way
Arterials and collectors are designated on the General Plan according to existing and projected needs.
Developers are responsible for the development of roadways associated with the residential project. City
roadways are required to be paved. Curbs/gutters and drainage facilities direct storm and runoff water out of
residential developments.
Development of and connection to municipal water and sewer services are required as a condition of
approving tract maps. Water service is necessary for a constant supply of potable water. Sewer services are
necessary for the sanitary disposal of wastewater. These off-site requirements allow for the development of
much higher residential densities.
B. NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
1. Vacant and Underutilized Land
A thorough analysis of vacant and underutilized land within the City of Oakley is provided in Appendix B.
2. Land Prices
Land costs have a demonstrable influence on the cost and availability of affordable housing. Land prices are
determined by numerous factors, most important of which are land availability and permitted development
densities. As land becomes less available, the price of land increases. Vacant, unentitled residential land in
Oakley is approximately $58,000 to $100,000 per acre. Individual residential lots range from $99,000 to
$250,000 acre. A vacant multi-family site is priced at $201,153 per acre.
Land costs in the San Francisco Bay Area are relatively high as compared with the rest of the nation. The
cost of land in Oakley is less than most areas in the San Francisco Bay Area, though higher than property in
the Central Valley. Given the current downturn in the real estate market and the limited number of parcels for
sale, land price projections are difficult to track accurately.
3. Construction Costs
Construction costs are primarily determined by the costs of materials and labor. They are also influenced by
market demands and market-based changes in the cost of materials. Construction costs depend on the type of
unit being built and the quality of the product being produced. Construction costs have remained relatively
steady, due in part to the economic downturn. Table 10-51 summarizes the estimated construction costs
based on type of development in Oakley.

4. Financing
Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing. Higher interest rates increase
a homebuyer’s monthly payment and decrease the range of housing that a household can afford. Lower
interest rates result in a lower cost and lower monthly payments for the homebuyer.
When interest rates rise, the market typically compensates by decreasing housing prices. Similarly, when
interest rates decrease, housing prices begin to rise. There is often a lag in the market, causing housing prices
to remain high when interest rates rise until the market catches up. Lower-income households often find it
most difficult to purchase a home during this time period.
As shown in Table 10-52, the number of loan applications increases as income increases. The percentage of
persons denied for a home loan in the Oakland-Fremont-Hayward Metropolitan Area is highest for the very
low-income (less than 50 percent of the MFI) category, at 21.7%.

Figure 10-2 shows the average interest rates between 2000 and 2013. Average annual interest rates have
generally decreased from approximately 8% in 2000 to approximately 4% in 2013. Interest rates are determined
by national policies and economic conditions and there is little that a local government can do to affect
these rates. However, in order to extend home buying opportunities to lower-income households,
jurisdictions can offer interest rate write-downs. Additionally, government insured loan programs may be
available to reduce mortgage down payment requirements.
There have been recent changes in the qualifications and lending standards for home loans. Nationally there
has been a large increase in the number of delinquencies and foreclosures in the residential market; as a result,
lenders have more stringent qualifications for home loans and lower-income households may find it more
difficult to qualify.

5. Energy Conservation
Energy conservation remains a major priority in the City of Oakley. The City continues to require compliance
with Title 24 of the California Administrative Code on the use of energy efficient appliances and insulation.
Through compliance with Title 24, new residential development has produced reduced energy demands.
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), which provides electricity and gas service in the City of Oakley,
offers public information and technical assistance to homeowners regarding energy conservation. PG&E
provides numerous incentives for energy efficient new construction and home remodeling. Remodeling
rebates include cool roofs, insulation and water heaters. Residents are granted between $150 - $200 per 1,000
square feet for installed cool roofs and attic and wall insulation. Installing new energy-efficient water heaters
qualifies residents with a $30 rebate.
PG&E also offers energy-efficiency tax credits under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Both homeowners and
builders may qualify for these tax credits. Existing homeowners are eligible for tax credits up to a maximum
of $500 for energy-efficiency improvements. An additional tax credit is available for solar energy systems.
Builders of energy-efficient new homes are eligible for tax credits up to a maximum of $2,000.
The City will develop an energy conservation strategy, which may include but is not limited to the following
programs to further encourage energy and resources conservation:
•         Provide incentives, such as expedited plan check or reduced building permit fees, for developments
utilizing green building or sustainable design
•         Promote the programs offered by PG&E through informational materials at City Hall, on the
City’s website, and at other public locations
Oakley General Plan                                                                                        10.III-30

                                                                           10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
•        Develop green building and sustainable design standards
•        Provide educational materials and technical assistance regarding energy conservation and green
building
•        Encourage green building and energy conservation techniques in projects utilizing the City’s
rehabilitation program or in City-assisted new construction
There are a number of national voluntary recognition programs that encourage energy efficient homes and
green building practices and provide guidance to cities and developers. Some of the programs utilized by the
housing industry include:
•        U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED green building programs
•        Build it Green’s Green Point Rated program
•        National Association of Home Builders Model Green Home Building program
•        U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star® for Homes program
•        Building Industry Institute’s California Green Builder program
Many of these programs have been designed to reduce the impacts associated with the construction and
operation of residential buildings through reductions in energy and water use, use of innovative technologies,
reduced maintenance costs, and improved occupant satisfaction. These programs and other programs similar
to these have been applied to numerous single- and multi-family residential projects throughout California
and nationwide.

IV. LAND RESOURCES AND AT-RISK UNITS
A. ADEQUATE SITES ANALYSIS
Each city is mandated through State Housing Element Law to demonstrate it has adequate sites available
through appropriate zoning and development standards and with the required infrastructure for a variety of
housing types and income levels. The City must demonstrate it has capacity or adequate sites to
accommodate the projected need for housing through the 2014-2022 planning period.
The State Department of Finance (DOF) is responsible for developing the total Statewide housing demand
projection. With the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), this demand is
apportioned to each of the State’s regions. The demand represents the number of additional units needed to
accommodate the anticipated growth in the number of households, to replace expected demolitions and
conversions of housing units to non-residential uses, and to allow for a future vacancy rate conducive to a
healthy functioning housing market.
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), the Council of Governments (COG) representing the
region, in cooperation with local jurisdictions, is responsible for allocating the region’s projected new housing
demand in each jurisdiction. This process is known as the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) and
the goals are referred to as the RHNA goals or the “regional share” goals for new housing construction. The
allocation takes into account factors such as employment opportunities, market demand for housing,
availability of suitable sites and public facilities, community patterns, types and tenure of housing needs and
others. The allocation is divided into four income categories:
 •    · Very-Low Income – 0 to 50 percent of the median income
 •    · Low Income – 51 to 80 percent of the median income
 •    · Moderate Income – 81 to 120 percent of the median income
 •    · Above-Moderate Income – more than 120 percent of the median income
In determining a jurisdiction’s share of new housing needs by income category, the allocation is adjusted to
avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in one jurisdiction. In addition to the allocation in
the four income categories, recent legislation requires cities to consider the needs of Extremely-Low Income
households earning 30 percent or less of the median income.
The RHNA prepared by ABAG for the planning period of January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2014, identifies
Oakley’s projected regional share need as 775 new housing units.
1. Construction Achievements in 2014
To determine the housing site needs for the 2014-2022 RHNA period, the needs are adjusted by the actual
number of housing units constructed from January 1, 2014, to the current period, or a total of 70 units
(through May 31, 2014). Of the 70 units constructed, 29 units are affordable to moderate income
households. The remaining 41 are assumed to be affordable to above moderate income households. An
additional 48 units are under construction, including a 29-unit affordable multifamily project. Based on this
adjustment, the remaining RHNA need for Oakley to accommodate is 1,048 units, with the allocations based

 2. Current Projects
 The remainder of Oakley’s RHNA needs for moderate and above moderate income households can be met
 through projects that are entitled but not yet constructed and through projects that are under construction.
 A total of 5,348 units have been entitled and are either located in projects that are entitled, but not yet under
 development, or projects that are under development. Table 10-56 identifies entitled projects that are not yet
 under development. Table 10-57 identifies entitled projects that are under development, including the total
 number of units approved, number constructed, and number of units remaining to be developed. Entitled
 projects are shown on Figure HO-1.
 Of these, 4,532 single family units and 195 multifamily units are entitled, but not yet constructed (Table 10-
 54) and an additional 4,991 single family/multifamily detached units and 567 multifamily attached units are
 planned in the approved East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan. As identified in Table 10-55, an additional 516
 single family and 105 multifamily units are located in approved projects that are either partially or entirely
 under construction.
 The single family units in Tables 10-54 and 10-55 are anticipated to be affordable primarily to above
 moderate income households; however, based on advertised sales prices and available market data, it is
 anticipated that approximately 30% of the single family units (2,856 units) will be affordable to moderate
 income households based on market conditions and current sales prices. These entitled projects are more
 than adequate to accommodate the City’s remaining need for moderate and above moderate income units.
 As identified in Section 3 below, the City has additional sites appropriate for single family and high density
 single family uses that can accommodate additional moderate and above moderate income households.
 Of the approved and under construction projects identified in Table 10-55, 29 multifamily units are currently
 being constructed by the Corporation for Better Housing as an affordable housing project that will provide 3
 extremely low, 15 very low, 11 low, and 1 moderate income units. The remaining 75 units on the
 Corporation for Better Housing site will be affordable to very low and low income households, pursuant to
 the project’s entitlements.

3. Vacant and Underutilized Land
The City has approximately 602.72 acres of vacant and underutilized residential land without a current project
entitlement or development agreement in place. These sites are anticipated to accommodate 1,559 single
family and 137 multifamily units. The underutilized parcels are zoned for residential use, but are developed
with residential units at densities lower than the maximum allowed or with non-residential uses and could
accommodate additional units. Table 10-56 summarizes vacant and underutilized parcels and their additional
development capacity. Sites included in the Inventory of Residential Land for Development (Table 10-56) are
shown on Figure HO-1. Appendix A describes each vacant and underutilized parcels, identifying the zoning
designation, General Plan designation, APN, acreage, existing uses, realistic capacity, and maximum
development potential; please note that the East Cypress Corridor parcels are summarized in Appendix B.
All of the underutilized parcels are minimally developed with single family homes and/or accessory structures
and do not have extensive development that would limit the future use of the parcel for the residential uses
considered in the General Plan, or are parcels that are mostly developed but could be split at some point to
accommodate additional units as allowed by the General Plan and Zoning Code. Exhibit 1 and shows the
locations of the vacant and underutilized parcels, except for the East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan parcels
which are shown in Appendix B.

4. Capacity to Meet Remaining RHNA Need
Based on constructed units and the current projects, the City has adequate approved and entitled projects to
meet the City’s moderate and above moderate income needs. The City has a total RHNA allocation of 175
moderate and 502 above moderate units. The single family and multifamily development projects identified
in Table 10-56, which identifies a total of 4,991 single family and 567 multifamily units, is more than adequate

to accommodate the City’s allocation of 677 moderate and above moderate income units.
The City has a total allocation of 489 extremely low, very low, and low income units. The 6.37-acre portion
of the CBH site has been approved and entitled for 105 units pursuant to a density bonus agreement with the
project applicant. Construction is underway on 29 units (3 extremely low, 15 very low, 11 low, and 1
moderate income units) on a portion of the 6.37-acre site and capacity remains for an additional 75 units,
consistent with the density bonus agreement and project entitlements.
After accounting for the CBH site, the City has 386 lower income units of the RHNA remaining to be
accommodated. As identified by Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B)(i), a default density allowing at
least 30 units per acre is appropriate to accommodate housing for lower income (extremely low, very low, and
low) households for jurisdictions in metropolitan counties. The City’s non-entitled multifamily sites have
densities of 9 and 12 units per acre. The City’s multifamily sites in the East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan
allow densities of 9 and 12 units per acre and a maximum density of 20 units per acre with an affordable
housing overlay. With the maximum density bonus available, these sites would allow 12.15 units per acre (M-
9 x 1.35), 16.2 units per acre (M-12 x 1.35), and 27 units per acre (East Cypress 20 x 1.35). None of these
densities are adequate to accommodate the City’s remaining allocation of 386 lower income units. The
Housing Plan includes a program to rezone sites with the AHO designation accommodate the remaining
need of 386 units. While the default density that can be assumed for Oakley to accommodate lower income
housing is 30 units per acre, the AHO designation, with a base density of 24 units per acre for affordable
housing projects, has successfully accommodated affordable housing in Oakley and is considered appropriate
to continue to accommodate the City’s lower income housing needs.
a. Feasibility Analysis – AHO Designation and Lower Income Housing Sites
Recent projects in Oakley include the Oak Ridge Family Apartments, Oak Meadow Family Apartments, and
Oak Forest Senior Villas. The Oak Forest Senior Villas was constructed in 2010; the Oak Ridge Family
Apartments and Oak Meadow Family Apartments are currently under construction. Each of these projects
provides 100% of units restricted to extremely low, very low, and low income households, with the exception
of one manager unit in each project.
Recent Project Experience
Details regarding each project are provided in Table 10-57 below. The following analysis describes residential
project experience, discusses market demand and trends, and describes the financial feasibility of developing
affordable units in zones with a density that permits less than 30 units per acre.

*Low Income Housing Tax Credit is not included in the gap financing as it is assumed that a successful lower income project will receive an LIHTC
allocation as the primary source of financing.
Market Demand and Trends
The City’s regional housing needs allocation demonstrates anticipated market demand for new housing
between 2014 and 2022. The City’s allocated new housing demand is 489 units for lower (extremely low, very
low, and low income) households from 2014 through 2022. In addition, the City has 3,035 existing lower
income households that are overpaying for housing that may support additional market demand for units
restricted to and affordable to lower income households.
As demonstrated in Table 10-57, housing trends to accommodate the City’s lower income housing needs in
recent years have been primarily multi-family apartment complexes, developed at densities of 24 to 31.6
dwelling units per acre. Most of these development projects have received density bonuses to accommodate
higher densities to maximize benefits of the base zoning (Affordable Housing Overlay – 24 units per acre).
The AHO designation encourages affordable development by providing an increase in density to the 24 units
per acre base density only to projects that include units affordable to very low and low income households.
Oakley General Plan                                                                                                                              10.IV-7

                                                                             10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
This process encourages development of affordable housing and also encourages use of the density bonus by
specifically specifying and encouraging use of the density bonus to accommodate higher densities, up to 32.4
units per acre, on the AHO sites.
Financial Feasibility
Recent projects in Oakley demonstrate the feasibility of constructing affordable housing on sites zoned for
less than 30 units per acre. Affordable projects have been successfully planned, financed, and developed on
sites that accommodate 24 dwelling units per acre through the AHO designation.
Each of the projects identified in Table 10-57 used tax credits as the primary source of financing, through the
state’s Tax Credit Allocation Committee LIHTC program. However, even with use of tax credits, each
project had a remaining financing gap. The financing gap ranged from $5,000 to $51,676 per residential unit
and was filled through various funding sources, including Contra Costa County HOME Consortium funds,
Contra Costa County Summer Lake Affordable Housing (SLAH) funds, and Federal Home Loan Bank
Affordable Housing Program (AHP) funds. Funding through the Contra Costa County HOME Consortium,
Contra Costa Urban County CDBG Program, and Federal Home Loan Bank AHP funds continue to be
available to assist in filling the financing gap for future development projects.
The Oak Ridge Family Apartments, Oak Meadow Family Apartments, and Oak Forest Senior Villas projects
were each constructed on AHO sites that permit 24 units per acre. The Oak Meadow Family Apartments
and Oak Forest Senior Villas projects received density bonuses and were constructed at 31.6 and 27.3 units
per acre, respectively. This demonstrates that the AHO zoning , which allows a base of 24 units per acre for
affordable housing projects, is sufficient and appropriate to accommodate lower income development in
Oakley. It is noted that the projects developed on AHO sites are not only appropriate for low income
households, but included a significant number of units affordable to extremely low and very low income
housing.
While no regional studies have been conducted recently to determine typical affordable housing densities in
the east Contra Costa County area or the broader region, recent affordable housing projects in the east county
region include The Grove at Sunset Court with a density of 17 units per acre (54 units on 3.18 acres) in
nearby Brentwood.
B. AT-RISK ASSISTED UNITS
State Housing Element Law requires the analysis of government-assisted housing that is eligible to change
from low-income to market-rate housing during the 2007-2014 planning period and the five years subsequent
(2015-2019). For the purpose of Housing Element Law, assisted housing developments are defined as
multifamily rental housing complexes that receive government assistance under federal, State, and/or local
programs. Housing assistance could include a rental subsidy, mortgage subsidy or density bonus for an
assisted housing development. Government assisted housing may convert to market-rate for a number of
reasons including expiring subsidies, mortgage repayments or expiration of affordability restrictions.
This section will addresses:
 •    An inventory of assisted housing units that are at-risk of converting to market rate housing;
 •    An analysis of the costs of preserving and/or replacing these units; and
 •    Resources that could be used to preserve at-risk units.

   1. Inventory of Assisted Affordable Units
   There are a total of 620 assisted housing units in Oakley. Of those units, none are “at-risk” of losing their
   affordability during the 2007-2014 planning period; 33 units are “at-risk” of losing their affordability between
   the years 2015-2019. Table 10-58 is an inventory of affordable housing units that are not at-risk between 2007
   and 2019.

   There are no assisted housing developments that are at-risk of converting from an affordable status to market
   rate in the next ten years. The earliest potential conversion, Golden Oak Manor, is in 2036. As there are no
   units at-risk of converting, a discussion of the cost to preserve affordability through new construction,
   rehabilitation, and/or subsidies is not required.

d. Resources for Preservation
There are a variety of federal, state and local housing programs to assist in the provision of affordable
housing through new construction, acquisition/rehabilitation, and subsidies. The following summarizes the
financial resources potentially available to developers and other entities interested in providing affordable
housing and related services in the City of Oakley.
i.        Federal and State Programs
Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) – CDBG funds are awarded to entitlement communities on a
formula basis for housing activities. Funding is awarded on a competitive basis to each participating city.
Activities eligible for CDBG funding include acquisition, rehabilitation, economic development and public
services. The City of Oakley participates in the Urban County program, through which Contra Costa County
administers CDBG funds for the unincorporated County as well as cities that participate in the program. The
City may receive funds, on a competitive basis, through the Urban County program.
HOME Investment Partnership – HOME funds are granted by a formula basis from HUD to increase the supply
of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing to lower income households. Eligible activities include new
construction, acquisition, rental assistance and rehabilitation. Oakley participates in the Contra Costa County-
administered HOME Consortium, which administers HOME funds to projects in participating jurisdictions.
HOME funds are typically allocated on a competitive basis.
Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program provides monthly
rental assistance payments to private landlords on behalf of low-income families who have been determined
eligible by the Housing Authority of Contra Costa County. The program's objective is to assist low-income
families by providing rental assistance so that families may lease safe, decent, and sanitary housing units in the
private rental market. The program is designed to allow families to move without the loss of housing
assistance. Moves are permissible as long as the family notifies the Housing Authority ahead of time,
terminates its existing lease within the lease provisions, and finds acceptable alternate housing.
Section 8 – Project Based Assistance. The Section 8 Project-Based program is a component of the Housing Choice
Voucher program. The program's objective is to induce property owners to make standard housing available
to low-income families at rents within the program limits. In return, the Housing Authority or HUD enters
into a contract with the owner that guarantees a certain level of rents. Section 811/202 Program (Supportive
Housing for Persons with Disabilities/Elderly) – Non- profit and consumer cooperatives can receive no interest
capital advances from HUD under the Section 202 program for the construction of Very-Low Income rental
housing for seniors and persons with disabilities. These funds can be used in conjunction with Section 811,
which can be used to develop group homes, independent living facilities and immediate care facilities. Eligible
activities include acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction and rental assistance.
 Affordable Housing Innovation Program (AHIP) – Loan and Practitioner Funds. The AHIP provides acquisition
financing to developers, through a non-profit fund manager, for the development or preservation of
affordable housing.
Building Equity and Growth in Neighborhoods (BEGIN). BEGIN provides grants to local jurisdictions to make
deferred payment second mortgage loans to qualified first-time low- and moderate-income home buyers for
the purchase of eligible newly constructed homes. No current funding is offered for this program.
California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) Multifamily Programs – CalHFA’s Multifamily Programs provide

                                                                             10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
permanent financing for the acquisition, rehabilitation, and preservation or new construction of rental
housing that includes affordable rents for Low and Moderate Income families and individuals. One of the
programs is the Preservation Acquisition Finance Program that is designed to facilitate the acquisition of at-
risk affordable housing developments and provide low-cost funding to preserve affordability.
CalHOME Program. CalHome provides grants to local public agencies and non-profit developers to assist
households in becoming homeowners. CalHome funds may be used for predevelopment, development,
acquisition, and rehabilitation costs as well as downpayment assistance.
California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA). CHFA offers permanent financing for acquisition and rehabilitation
to for-profit, non-profit, and public agency developers seeking to preserve "at-risk" housing units. In
addition, CHFA offers low interest predevelopment loans to nonprofit sponsors through its
acquisition/rehabilitation program.
Emergency Housing and Assistance Program (EHAP). EHAP provides funds to local government agencies and
non-profit corporations for capital development activities and facility operation for emergency shelters,
transitional housing and safe havens that provide shelter and supportive services for homeless individuals and
families. No current funding is offered for this program.
Emergency Solutions Grant. The purpose of the Emergency Shelter Grants Program is to provide emergency
shelter and related services to the County's homeless populations. Eligible activities include: the rehabilitation
and conversion of buildings for use as emergency shelters; the provision of essential services to the homeless;
operating support for emergency shelters; and homeless prevention/rapid rehousing activities. ESG funds
administered by Contra Costa County can be used within the Urban County.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Federal Home Loan Bank System facilitates Affordable Housing
Programs (AHP), which subsidize the interest rates for affordable housing. The San Francisco Federal Home
Loan Bank District provides local service within California. Interest rate subsidies under the AHP can be
used to finance the purchase, construction, and/or rehabilitation of rental housing. Very low income
households must occupy at least 20 percent of the units for the useful life of the housing or the mortgage
term.
Infill Infrastructure Grant Program. The program funds infrastructure improvements to facilitate new housing
development with an affordable component in residential or mixed use infill projects and infill areas.
Joe Serna Jr. Farmworker Housing Grant Program (Serna). The Serna program finances the new construction,
rehabilitation and acquisition of owner- and renter-occupied housing units for agricultural workers, with a
priority for lower income households. No current funding is offered for this program.
Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC) administers the
federal and state Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Programs. Both programs were created to encourage
private investment in affordable rental housing for households meeting certain income requirements. Under
these programs, housing tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects. Twenty percent of federal
credits are reserved for rural areas, and ten percent for non-profit sponsors. To compete for the credit, rental
housing developments have to reserve units at affordable rents to households at or below 46 percent of area
median income. The assisted units must be reserved for the target population for 55 years. The federal tax
credit provides a subsidy over ten years towards the cost of producing a unit. Developers sell these tax
benefits to investors for their present market value to provide up-front capital to build the units. Credits can

                                                                               10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
be used to fund the hard and soft costs (excluding land costs) of the acquisition, rehabilitation, or new
construction of rental housing. Projects not receiving other federal subsidy receive a federal credit of nine
percent per year for ten years and a state credit of 30 percent over four years (high cost areas and qualified
census tracts get increased federal credits). Projects with a federal subsidy receive a four percent federal credit
each year for ten years and a 13 percent state credit over four years. The CTCAC also administers a
Farmworker Housing Assistance Program and a Commercial Revitalization Deduction Program.
Low-Income Housing Preservation and Residential Home Ownership Act (LIHPRHA). LIHPRHA requires that all
eligible HUD Section 236 and Section 221(d) projects “at-risk” of conversion to market-rate rental housing
through the mortgage prepayment option be subject to LIHPRHA Incentives. The incentives to owners
include HUD subsidies which guarantee owners an eight percent annual return on equity. Owners must file a
Plan of Action to obtain incentives or offer the project for sale to a) non-profit organizations, b) tenants, or
c) public bodies for a 12 month period followed by an additional three-month sale to other purchasers. Only
then are owners eligible to prepay the subsidized mortgages.
Multifamily Housing Program (MHP). The MHP program provides low interest loans to developers of affordable
rental and transitional housing projects. Funds may be used for new construction, rehabilitation, acquisition
and rehabilitation, or conversion of non-residential structures.
Preservation Interim Repositioning Program (PIRP). PIRP is a short-term loan program designed to preserve
housing at risk of conversion to market rates. Only non-profits, dedicated to the provision of affordable
housing, may apply. Local matching funds, together with PIRP funds, may not exceed 20 percent of total
costs. No current funding is offered for this program.
California Community Reinvestment Corporation (CCRC) – The California Community Reinvestment Corporation
is a multifamily affordable housing lender whose mission is to increase the availability of affordable housing
for Low Income families, seniors and residents with special needs by facilitating private capital flow from its
investors for debt and equity to developers of affordable housing. Eligible activities include new construction,
rehabilitation and acquisition of properties.
iii. Local Programs
With the statewide closure of redevelopment agencies, the City of Oakley no longer has a dedicated program
and funding source to directly assist with the development of affordable housing. Local programs, such as the
density bonus program and related incentives, are discussed in Chapter II.
iv. Qualified Entities to Preserve At-Risk Units
24 non-profit corporations currently working in Contra Costa County and 96 entities working statewide have
the experience and capacity to assist in preserving at-risk units. These organizations are tracked by HCD and
up-to-date contact information for each entity can be obtained via the HCD website at:

V.       EFFECTIVENESS OF PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
Accomplishments under the 2009 Housing Element are evaluated in this chapter in order to determine the
effectiveness of the previous housing element, the City’s progress in implementing the 2009 Housing
Element, and the appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies. This evaluation is conducted
pursuant to Government Code Section 65588.
A.       REVIEW OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
The 2009 Housing Element program strategy focused on the accomplishment of policies and implementation
of programs to encourage the production of new housing, including affordable and special needs housing, to
encourage the rehabilitation and weatherization of existing housing, revisions to the City’s Zoning Ordinance
to remove constraints and address requirements of State law, to provide housing opportunities for extremely
low income households, the elderly, disabled persons, large families, and homeless, including at-risk, persons
through provision of appropriate programs and removal of constraints to development of units appropriate
for these populations, and to encourage fair housing and non-discrimination. The 2009 Housing Element
identified the following goals:
 •    Goal 1        Production of New Housing. Provide adequate sites to accommodate the City’s share of
      regional housing needs through appropriate zoning and development standards; and where appropriate,
      removal of identified governmental constraints to the development of housing.
 •    Goal 2:       Rehabilitation of Existing Housing Stock. Conserve and improve the condition of
      existing housing stock for all income levels.
 •    Goal 3:       Preservation and Conservation of Existing Housing Resources. Preserve existing
      affordable housing and maintain community character.
 •    Goal 4:       Increase Access to Housing Opportunities. Promote housing opportunities for all
      persons, regardless of race, religion, sex, marital status, ancestry, national origin, color, familial status or
      disability.
The 2009 Housing Element included policies actions to achieve the identified goals. Table 10-60 analyzes
each policy action provided in the 2009 Housing Element, describing the results of the program and
recommending whether each policy action should be kept, modified, or removed in this update to the
Housing Element.
B.       APPROPRIATENESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HOUSING ELEMENT
The overarching goals and policies of the 2009 Housing Element continue to be appropriate to encourage the
City’s housing goals and will be kept in the Housing Plan. The 2009 Housing Element included policy actions
that are appropriate to meet the requirements of State law. The City has maintained consistency with the
policy actions in the 2009 Housing Element and implemented many programs, as described below. The
policy actions related to maintaining the housing stock, providing adequate housing sites, encouraging new
housing, ensuring fair housing opportunities, and encouraging energy efficiency continue to be relevant and
applicable.
As discussed in Table 10-59, the majority of housing programs have been effective or are necessary and the
intent of these programs will be kept in the Housing Element, with revisions to address identified specific
housing needs, constraints, or other concerns identified as part of this update.
During the 2007-2014 Housing Element period, a total of 1,609 housing units were constructed. The City
was extremely proactive in ensuring the Housing Element’s effectiveness through rezoning adequate sites to

accommodate affordable housing and taking multiple steps to reduce constraints to housing development.
Of the 1,609 housing units, 404 are affordable to lower income households (10 – extremely low, 214 – very
low, and 180 – low) and 874 are affordable to moderate income households. Three senior affordable housing
projects were developed, totaling 152 units. Large families were assisted through 105 units affordable to
lower income households. The City updated its density bonus ordinance, accommodated emergency shelters,
and revised the Affordable Housing Overlay designation.
The Housing Plan included in this 2014 Housing Element includes modifications to make programs more
effective, clarify objectives, and ensure that the programs are implementable. See the Housing Plan for the
goals and policy actions of this Housing Element.
C.        SHORTCOMINGS OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
There were no significant shortcomings of the Housing Element. During a period where the housing market
struggled, the City achieved substantial success in providing housing at a range of affordability levels as well
as a variety of housing types to serve various populations, including families, seniors, large households, and
lower income households. The full number of extremely low income units was not constructed; however,
this is not due to a lack of effort but rather a lack of funding sources necessary for the deep subsidies required
for extremely low income units. However, 10 extremely low income units were constructed and 3 more are
under construction. Several policy actions require refining in order to fully address requirements of State law
related to transitional and supportive housing as discussed in the table below.

VI. HOUSING PLAN
	  
      A. GOALS AND POLICY ACTIONS
	  
      This section describes the City of Oakley’s Housing Plan for the 2014-2022 RHNA period and the
      2015-2023 planning period. The Housing Plan identifies specific goals and presents specific policy
      actions necessary to address present and future housing needs, meet statutory requirements and
      consider the input by residents and stakeholders. In developing this Housing Plan, the City assessed its
      housing needs, evaluated the performance of existing programs, and collaborated with residents and
      stakeholders.
	  
      The City of Oakley has identified four broad areas of housing policy priorities:
	  
           •   Production of New Housing
           •   Rehabilitation of Existing Housing Stock
           •   Preservation and Conservation of Existing Housing Resources
           •   Increase Access to Housing Opportunities
	  
      Goal 1: Production of New Housing
      Provide adequate sites to accommodate the City’s share of regional housing needs,
      including housing for special needs groups, through appropriate zoning and
      development standards; and where appropriate, removal of identified governmental
      constraints to the development of housing.
	  
      Policy Action 1.1: Provision of Adequate Sites to Meet Remaining RHNA Need
      To ensure the availability of adequate sites to accommodate the City’s projected future construction
      needs by income category, the City shall rezone adequate sites to accommodate 386 lower income units.
      The sites shall be zoned to permit owner-occupied and rental multifamily residential use by right. At
      least 50 percent of the very low and low-income housing need shall be accommodated on sites
      designated for residential use and for which nonresidential uses or mixed-uses are not permitted.
      The City shall rezone the sites identified in Table 60 to include the Affordable Housing Overlay
      designation, which requires a minimum base density of 24 units per acre and allows up to 32.4 units per
      acre.

      Policy Action 1.3: Density Bonus Ordinance
      Continue to use the Density Bonus Ordinance and associated incentives to encourage affordable housing,
      including housing for special needs populations. The City shall review and revise the existing Density
      Bonus Ordinance when required by any future revisions to State density bonus law.
	  
      Objective:                                                          Implement Density Bonus Ordinance

      Policy Action 1.3: Review and Revise Development Fees
      The City will continue to monitor required development fees including in-lieu fees, development impact
      fees, and processing fees, with the aim of reducing constraints on the development of affordable
      residential projects, including, but not limited to, senior housing, housing for farmworkers,
      emergency/transitional housing, housing for persons with disabilities (including developmental), single
      room occupancies, and second units. To respond to changing local market conditions during the
      planning period, the City shall revise required development fees, if it is deemed appropriate.
      Where fees are established and administered by regional agencies, such as the Regional Transportation
      Development Impact Fee, Ironhouse Sanitary District Fee, and Diablo Water District Fee, the City will
      request the administering agency to review and reduce fees if the City has determined that the agency’s fee
      is constraining the residential development, particularly development of affordable housing and/or
      housing for special needs groups.
	  
      Objective:                                                          Review and Revise Development Fees

     Policy Action 1.5: Encourage Residential Development in Areas Served by Public Transit
     To encourage residential development in areas where regular transit service exists or is anticipated to
     serve, the City shall consider establishing criteria for proximity to public transit in the review of
     proposed residential development, particularly multifamily, affordable (lower income), and projects serving
     special needs groups (seniors, disabled, developmentally disabled, single female-headed households, and
     homeless). The City shall continue to offer various incentives to developers for transit-serving
     development, including but not limited to reduced parking standards and reduced setback requirements.

     Policy Action 1.6: Maintain an Inventory of Available Land Resources
     The City shall maintain and regularly update the inventory that details the amount, type, and size of vacant
     and underutilized parcels to assist developers in identifying land suitable for residential development.
     The City will include the land inventory in the City’s comprehensive housing outreach strategy. The City

     development through proactive and coordinated efforts with the Planning Department, private
     development and non- profit entities, and other housing related groups. Through these efforts, the
     City’s aim is to encourage the construction of residential development affordable to extremely low, very
     low, low, and moderate income households through a menu of incentives, such as streamlined review,
     reduced development standards, land assemblage, lot consolidation, fee assistance, and other methods
     identified in the Density Bonus Ordinance. The City will provide information on potential infill
     development areas, including areas appropriate for smaller projects that serve specific special needs
     populations, such as residential care facilities, transitional housing, and supportive housing, and available
     incentives as part of the City’s comprehensive housing outreach strategy.

     Policy Action 1.8: Jobs-Housing Balance Evaluation
     Jobs-housing balance is a measure of the harmony between employment and dwelling units in a specific
     area. A low jobs-housing ratio indicates a housing rich “bedroom c o m m u n i t y ,” while a high jobs-
     housing ratio indicates an employment center. In areas where jobs and housing are in balance,
     residents on average commute shorter distances and spend less time in cars, reducing transportation-
     related environmental impacts and improving quality of life. The City shall promote a jobs/housing
     balance in the community by analyzing the status of jobs and housing within the community and
     providing information to large employers of new commercial and industrial projects on housing
     developments within the community.

     Policy Action 1.9: Annual Review and Reporting of Housing Element Progress
     As required by State law, the City will conduct an annual progress review for the 2007-2014
     Housing Element. This review will include the following information: a log of new residential
     development permits and completion reports; inventory of units b u i l t in the Extremely-Low, Very-Low,
     and Low Income categories; an update or inventory of approved projects; an annual estimate of
     population from the State Department of Finance; and available vacant land and zoning survey. The
     annual review will serve as proactive tool to monitor the effectiveness of the Housing Element’s policy
     program and can help identify necessary changes to successfully implement the City’s housing goals and
     policies.

     Policy Action 1.10: Affordable Housing Overlay
     To encourage affordable housing development in Oakley, the City has adopted an Affordable
     Housing Overlay (AHO). The AHO allows higher densities for projects on sites zoned Multi-Family
     High and meeting state density bonus requirements. The AHO also provides development standards
     consistent with the higher density allowed. To ensure effectiveness in implementation, the City shall
     revise the AHO to clarify that the AHO is consistent with all multifamily zoning districts and with all
     Specific Plan districts that allow multifamily housing. The City shall also revise the AHO district to
     provide for a transition in building heights where multifamily development projects are located adjacent
     land zoned for single family residential uses.
	  
     Objective:                                           Review and revise the Affordable Housing

     B.        Quantified Objectives
	  
     Table 10-61 summarizes the quantified objectives by income category for the 2015-2023 Housing Element
     planning period. The quantified objectives anticipate that the City or developers building in the City will
     receive funding assistance to subsidize the extremely low, very low, and low income units as the City does
     not have any funding sources for new construction or rehabilitation. The quantified objectives recognize
     that the City no longer has access to redevelopment agency funds and that many federal and state
     programs have been cut. Thus, the objectives are based on the expectation that the City and/or
     developers serving the City will be able to successfully compete for limited federal and state funding
     sources to assist in the construction and rehabilitation of extremely low, very low, and low income units.

VII. COMMUNITY OUTREACH
A. INTRODUCTION
During 2014, the City sought input on the concerns and ideas of community members and housing
stakeholder groups through community outreach activities. The City held a community workshop in
February 2014, formed an Ad Hoc Citizen Advisory Committee and held four CAC meetings open to the
public during the update process, and held three City Council meetings.
B. COMMUNITY WORKSHOP
A community workshop was held on February 27, 2014 to provide interested residents, businesspeople,
stakeholders, and the public an opportunity to learn about the Housing Element update process and to
comment on housing issues, needs, and priorities. The community workshop was noticed through multiple
venues in order to reach a broad segment of the community and encourage participation in the meeting:
    •    Newspaper (Oakley Press)
    •    City website
    •    Chamber of Commerce
    •    City Reader Board
The following groups were also provided notice of the community workshop:
    •    Affordable housing developers
    •    Service providers, including senior organizations (Oakley Seniors), emergency food providers
         (Loaves and Fishes, Saint Anthony’s Catholic Church, and Delta Family Bible Church), Contra Costa
         County Health Services, Contra Costa County Employment and Human Services, Oakley Union
         Elementary School District, Liberty Union High School District, Antioch Unified School District,
         and Knightsen Elementary School District.
Workshop participants were given an opportunity to comment on housing issues, including challenges, needs,
and opportunities related to the provision of housing, maintenance of housing, and housing for various
income levels and special needs groups. Comments received from participants are summarized below:
Challenges
    •    Having roads, schools, and parks in place as the houses are being built
    •    How to provide affordable housing without sacrificing quality of life to City residents
    •    Traffic patterns
    •    No rezoning
    •    Keep low density zoning next to farming
    •    Slum-oriented predator groups building substandard apartments while collecting high rents
    •    Do not change zoning

    •    Those who are upside down in the current home (mortgage)
    •    Devaluation of current housing prices
    •    Crime
    •    Integrate [housing] throughout City
    •    Land
    •    How to allocate land for low income to meet state requirements but discourage development
Priorities
    •    Emergency services
    •    Housing the people can live in happily, like Brentwood Senior Commons versus Corp for Better
         Housing in Oakley
    •    Do not touch farmland or ancient vines
    •    Do not be another Antioch
    •    Keep farming #1 priority
Opportunities
    •    Hiring people within our City for the jobs that come up (construction, Parks Dept., etc.)
    •    Local job opportunities
    •    Small business assistance
    •    Say no, none
    •    To create living spaces that would enhance the quality of life for affordable housing residents and
         Oakley
C.       AD HOC CITIZEN ADVISORY GROUP
The City Council appointed an Ad Hoc Citizen Advisory Group of five members and one alternate.
Meetings of the Ad Hoc Citizen Advisory Committee were noticed via the newspaper and City website.
The Ad Hoc Citizen Advisory Group met in September 2013, April 2014, August 2014, and September 2014.
The group was provided with an overview of the Housing Element process and was asked to identify
potential sites for multifamily housing in the event that additional sites were needed to accommodate housing
needs. Two members of the public attended the meeting, but did not comment. Sites identified for further
consideration by the Ad Hoc Citizen Advisory Group at its April 2014 meeting are included as Appendix C.

                                                                           10.0 – HOUSING ELEMENT
D.       CITY COUNCIL
The City Council reviewed the Preliminary Draft Housing Element in August 2014. After receiving public
comment related to the housing sites identified by Policy Action 1.1, the Council directed staff to identify
additional potential sites that could be designated with the Affordable Housing Overlay zone. Staff identified
additional sites and met with the Ad Hoc Citizen Advisory Group in September 2014 to receive comments.
The City Council met on October 14, 2014 and received additional public comment on the Preliminary Draft
Housing Element. Following public comment, the City Council directed staff to revise Policy Action 1.1 to
include APNs 033012004, 033, 012005, 033012007, 033180007, 033012009, 033012008, and 03403007.
The City Council considered adoption of the Housing Element on January 27, 2015. The City Council
considered public input that was received prior to adoption of the Housing Element. Following the public
and HCD review period, the Housing Element was revised to address issues identified by HCD during the
review period and to address comments received from the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservancy.
In order to provide for increased outreach to the lower income groups, including family, senior, and disabled
households, in response to HCD concerns raised during the City’s conference call with HCD in December
2014 to review the Housing Element, notice of the meeting was posted at affordable housing developments
in the City, including The Commons at Oak Grove, Summer Creek Place, Golden Oak Manor, Courtyards at
Cypress Grove, Oakley Place Senior Apartments, Oak Grove Terrace, Oak Forest Senior Villas, Silver Oaks,
and Oakley Summer Creek Apartments, in order to encourage participation by lower income households.
The January 27, 2015 City Council meeting was noticed through multiple venues in order to reach a broad
segment of the community and encourage participation in the meeting:
     •   Newspaper (Oakley Press)
     •   City website
     •   Chamber of Commerce
     •   City Reader Board
The following groups were also provided notice of the January 27, 2015 City Council Meeting:
     •   Affordable housing developers
     •   Service providers, including senior organizations, emergency food providers, Contra Costa County
         Health Services, Contra Costa County Employment and Human Services, Oakley Union Elementary
         School District, Liberty Union High School District, Antioch Unified School District, and Knightsen
         Elementary School District.
The Housing Element was made available for review on the City’s website and at City Hall and the Oakley
Library Branch.
