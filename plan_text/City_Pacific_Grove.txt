Housing Element 2015-2023                                                                Executive Summary
 1. Executive Summary
 The Housing Element is one of the seven mandated “Elements” of the City of Pacific Grove General
 Plan. It is the only element that is statutorily required to be updated on a prescribed schedule and
 submitted to the State of California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for
 review. The planning period for this Housing Element is December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2023.
 State Housing Element law, enacted in 1969, recognizes the vital role local governments play in the
 supply and affordability of housing. The law acknowledges that in order for the private market to
 adequately address housing needs and demand, local governments must adopt land use plans and
 regulatory systems which provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing
 development. As a result, housing policy in the State rests largely upon the effective implementation of
 local general plans and, in particular, housing elements.
 Housing Element law requires that each Housing Element include the following:
         •    Description of public participation in the update process;
         •    Review of accomplishments in achieving the goals, policies, and programs outlined in the
              previous Housing Element;
         •    An assessment of housing needs including affordability, the condition of the City’s housing
              stock, and special housing needs;
         •    An inventory of resources available for housing development and improvement and a review
              of governmental, non-governmental, and infrastructure constraints to housing development;
              and
         •    Goals, policies, and programs to address housing needs and improve housing conditions for
              the current planning period.
 Meeting the above listed requirements and achieving a finding of compliance by HCD is essential in
 maximizing eligibility for State funding opportunities. In addition to demonstrating compliance with
 State law, the Housing Element update serves as an important opportunity to address identified needs
 and outline strategies to improve the quality of living environments in the City of Pacific Grove.
 Planning tools such as zoning regulations can encourage housing options that meet the needs and
 preferences of a diverse population.
 1.1 Housing Needs, Opportunities, and Constraints
 The City of Pacific Grove has experienced a small decline in population over the past 25 years
 (population was estimated at 15,388 as of 2015 compared to 16,117 in 1990). The size and composition
 of the City’s housing stock has also changed very little since 1990 with a net increase of about 270 units.
 The City is nearly built-out, with limited vacant land available for new housing development.
 The limited supply of vacant land as well as the City’s desirable location, physical beauty, and unique
 character have contributed to steady demand and housing sales prices that are consistently among the
 highest in the state. High home prices, the number of second homes, and investment properties
 contribute to the high percentage of renter-occupied units, which was estimated at 53% according to
 recent Census reports.
 Most of the City’s housing stock (over 90%) was built before 1979, thus there is an ongoing need to
 facilitate and assist in the rehabilitation and maintenance of homes in Pacific Grove to ensure that units

 remain safe and attractive. A 2005 housing conditions survey found that approximately 17% of units
 were in need of some level of rehabilitation.
 In addition to limited land resources, the City faces a number of challenges to providing affordable
 housing, including conserving natural resources and City character, balancing economic development
 with housing needs, and contracting housing and financial markets. However, the greatest obstacle to
 housing development is the lack of available water.
 Since October 2009, California American Water, the water purveyor to the City of Pacific Grove, has
 been under a Cease and Desist Order from the State Water Resources Control Board, reducing the
 available water supply for the Monterey Peninsula, placing a moratorium on all new water connections,
 and further restricting pumping on the Carmel River from its previous 1990 Order. While the City is
 actively participating in the regional effort to develop an alternative water source, the lack of water is
 likely to be a constraint to housing production in the 2015-2023 planning period.
 1.2 Regional Housing Needs Allocation
 California law requires HCD to project statewide housing needs and allocate those needs to each
 regional government in the State. For Pacific Grove, the regional planning agency is the Association of
 Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG). After consultation with the AMBAG, HCD provided the
 regional need to AMBAG, which then distributed the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) to
 the counties and cities within the AMBAG region. AMBAG allocates housing production goals for
 each jurisdiction primarily based on their “fair-share” of the region’s population growth, which is
 outlined in the AMBAG 2014-2023 Regional Housing Needs Allocation Plan (RHNAP). Of the 10,430
 total housing units allocated to AMBAG for this planning period, Pacific Grove has been allocated 115
 units. One of the primary purposes of the Housing Element update is to demonstrate the City’s ability
 to accommodate residential development commensurate with the RHNA.
 The projected housing needs in the RHNA are categorized by affordability based on standards for very-
 low-, low-, moderate-, and above-moderate-income households established by the U.S. Department of
 Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (California Health and Safety Code §50079.5). According to the
 2014-2023 RHNAP, Pacific Grove must accommodate 28 very-low-income, 18 low-income, 21
 moderate-income, and 48 above-moderate-income housing units. The intent of the breakdown between
 income categories is to encourage a full range of housing opportunities for households of all economic
 segments in each jurisdiction over time.
 As outlined in Chapter 4, the City has adequate sites to accommodate its RHNA allocation based on
 units already constructed or approved, vacant land available for development, underutilized sites with
 potential for increased density or redevelopment, and the potential for additional second units. The
 focus of the adequate sites analysis is on appropriate zoning for a range of housing types and densities,
 and cities are not penalized if development does not meet the RHNA allocations due to circumstances
 beyond their control, such as insufficient water supplies.
 1.3 Housing Strategy
 The goals, policies, and programs listed in Chapter 3 outline the City’s approach to meeting identified
 housing needs for the current planning period. Policies and programs were developed based on
 accomplishments from the previous Housing Element, changes to State law, and input from members

 of the public, committees, elected officials, and City Staff. Each program identifies the responsible
 department, timeframe for implementation, potential funding source, and, where appropriate, the
 number of housing units the City expects to add, rehabilitate, or preserve as a result of the program.
 The previous Housing Element included a number of successful housing programs that have been
 continued for the current planning period. The City intends to continue to pursue funding to maintain,
 and if possible, expand the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program, Emergency Home Repair Loan
 Program, and Rental Assistance Program. The City will also continue to explore funding options for
 programs to promote home ownership.
 Current policies and programs continue to recognize the value of second units as a viable affordable
 housing source. To promote second unit development, the City intends to review the Second Unit
 Ordinance and make second unit construction more attractive to help address the needs of lower-
 income households.
 Programs are also included to ensure that the Zoning Code complies with State housing law, including
 Density Bonus Law and Senate Bill 2, which addresses the need for emergency shelters and
 transitional/supportive housing. Other Zoning Code revisions would establish regulations for single-
 room occupancy units in appropriate zones, and allow flexibility in parking standards.
 In addition, programs are included to facilitate affordable housing development, such as establishing a
 housing trust fund, an affordable housing overlay to incentivize affordable unit development in the
 Forest Hill Commercial District, and the preparation of a specific plan or master plan to identify
 opportunities and establish standards for additional housing in the downtown area.

 2. Introduction
 2.1 Community Context
 The City of Pacific Grove (“Pacific Grove” or “the City”) is a coastal community located on the
 Monterey Peninsula in Monterey County, California. The City was established in the late 1800s as a
 Methodist Retreat Center and incorporated in 1889. Pacific Grove is characterized by the historic
 downtown and residential neighborhoods and dramatic ocean views. The City covers 2.8 square miles
 and is bounded by Pebble Beach to the southwest, Monterey to the southeast, Monterey Bay to the
 northeast, and the Pacific Ocean to the northwest. Pacific Grove is located approximately 15 miles to
 the southwest of Salinas and 50 miles to the southwest of San Jose (see Figure 2-1).
 Figure 2-1      Pacific Grove Location Map
 2.2 Public Participation
 According to State law, local jurisdictions must “make a diligent effort to achieve public participation of
 all economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element, and the program
 shall describe this effort” (California Government Code §65583(c)). Active community participation
 throughout the update process contributes to a Housing Element that is a more thorough and accurate
 representation of the City’s needs and desired actions. Public input played an important role in the
 formulation of this Housing Element. Public outreach activities included a community workshop and
 public hearings with the Planning Commission and City Council, all of which were advertised and open
 to the public.
 Throughout the Housing Element Update process, the City maintained a notification list to ensure that
 interested parties and organizations representing members of the populations with special housing
 needs were directly invited to participate. The list included, but was not limited to the following
 organizations:
      •   Center of Community Advocacy
      •   Central Coast Center for Independent Living
      •   Central Coast Senior Services

 on the City’s website (www.cityofpacificgrove.org), and direct notices of opportunities to participate in
 the Housing Element update were sent to those on the mailing list. Please refer to Appendix C for
 more information regarding the public review process.
 2.3 General Plan Consistency
 State law requires that the General Plan and all of its elements comprise an “integrated, internally
 consistent, and compatible statement of policies.” The Housing Element is Chapter 3 of the Pacific
 Grove General Plan. The other General Plan Elements were last updated in 1994. This Housing
 Element builds upon the existing General Plan and is consistent with its goals, policies, and programs.
 Consistency between the Housing Element and the General Plan will continue to be evaluated as other
 Elements of the General Plan are amended and modifications will be made as necessary to maintain
 consistency.
 2.4 Housing Element Organization
 The Housing Element is organized as follows:
      •   Chapter 3. Goal, Policies, and Programs. Housing goals, policies, and programs to address
          the City’s identified housing needs.
      •   Chapter 4. Needs Assessment. A profile of the community including an analysis of the City’s
          population, housing characteristics and trends, and special housing needs.
      •   Chapter 5. Land Availability and Housing Resources. An evaluation of the land and
          financial resources available to address Pacific Grove’s housing goals.
      •   Chapter 6. Constraints. Review of potential governmental, market, and environmental
          constraints that may limit the City’s ability to address its housing needs.
 March 2016                                                                                           Page 6

 3. Goals, Policies, Programs and Objectives
 This Chapter identifies housing goals, policies, programs and objectives for the City of Pacific Grove
 during the 2015-2023 planning period. In order to make adequate provisions for the housing needs of
 all economic segments of the community, Pacific Grove has developed the following goals:
        1.    Support the maintenance and rehabilitation of the City’s existing housing stock and
              residential neighborhoods.
        2.    Provide diverse, high quality housing choices appropriate for residents at all income levels.
        3.    Reduce governmental and infrastructure constraints to the improvement and development
              of housing for people of all income levels.
        4.    Increase housing opportunities for persons with special housing needs.
        5.    Ensure equal opportunities to secure appropriate housing for all persons regardless of race,
              gender, familial status, ancestry, national origin, color, or sexual orientation, or other
              potential barriers that prevent choice in housing.
        6.    Ensure resource efficiency in new and existing housing units.
 The City will make its best efforts to work toward these Housing Element goals and implement the
 associated programs. Wherever revisions to other elements of the General Plan or the City’s Municipal
 Code are required to achieve these goals, such revisions will be subject to the public review process.
 The City also notes that achievement of the City’s housing development goals is dependent on the
 future availability of water. If programs are not implemented due to these constraints, other programs
 will be considered in order to achieve the intent of the original program. Adopted programs will be
 evaluated for their effectiveness in the annual review process and in the next Housing Element update.
 3.1 Housing Goals, Policies, and Programs
 Goal 1              Support the maintenance and rehabilitation of the city’s existing
                     housing stock and residential neighborhoods.
 Policy 1.1          Encourage rehabilitation and private reinvestment to protect residential
                     neighborhoods from deterioration.
 Program 1.1         Housing Preservation and Rehabilitation
                     In order to facilitate preservation and rehabilitation of the existing housing stock, the

                    attract potential affordable housing developers, fund the Rental Assistance Program,
                    and leverage other resources. A potential source of funds could be the transient
                    occupancy tax (TOT) on private short-term rentals, which may have the effect of
                    reducing the supply of housing for the local workforce.

                    Bonus Law (California Government Code §65915). To ensure successful implementation,
                    the City will encourage developers to utilize the density bonus provisions to increase
                    the number of units in the underlying zone in return for construction of lower-
                    income housing (extremely-low-, very-low-, and low-income units) by providing

                    Inform commercial developers of zoning provisions allowing residential and mixed
                    uses in commercial zones and the City’s policies favoring such development.
                    Specifically discuss potential residential and mixed-use development opportunities
                    and available incentives, such as a density bonus, with landowners and developers
                    with an interest in the sites identified in Section 5.2, Sites Inventory and Analysis.
                    Identify and contact owners of underutilized motels or other commercial structures
                    that are in need of rehabilitation and consider offering financial assistance or other
                    incentives, where feasible, to encourage converting and/or upgrading their buildings

                    Consider establishing an affordable housing overlay to promote the development of
                    multifamily affordable housing in the Forest Hill Commercial District. The overlay
                    could include development incentives to encourage lot consolidation and affordable
                    unit development, particularly mixed-use projects including commercial space and

 Program 2.3.e      Facilitate Housing Development on Underutilized Parcels
                    Historically, the City of Pacific Grove contained many small residential lots that
                    through years of zoning, have been made non-conforming because they are
                    considered too small. The City will evaluate specific residential locations that could
                    accommodate small or tiny houses on undersized parcels, such as areas that directly
                    abut a commercial area, and examine potential modifications to site development
                    standards that could encourage such homes where they would be most appropriate.
                    Evaluate opportunities for parcel assembly and the use of substandard or
                    underutilized parcels for affordable housing by relaxing development standards,
                    developing procedures to facilitate the process, and working with property owners
                    and developers.
                    Evaluate the feasibility of reinstating the Illegal Housing Unit Registration Program if
                    the units meet health and safety inspection and documentation requirements. Unit
                    registration should require a deed restriction stipulating that the unit is affordable to
                    very low-income households in perpetuity.

                    permanent housing. The City will review this issue and if it is determined to have a
                    significant effect on affordable housing cost and supply, appropriate actions will be
                    considered to offset these effects and mitigate this impact.

                    stipulating that the units remain affordable to low-income households in perpetuity.
                    The ordinance should continue to allow second units in all residential zones, with the

                    In order to ensure that adequate sites are available throughout the planning period to
                    accommodate the City’s RHNA, the City will continue to comply with California
                    Government Code §65863 through a project-by-project evaluation.
                    When water allocations become available for commercial, mixed-use, and residential
                    development, if the ongoing monitoring of development proposals indicates
                    commercial/mixed-use sites are not providing for residential development
                    opportunities as anticipated to address the housing needs for all income levels, the
                    City will develop additional strategies to encourage and facilitate the development of
                    multi-family housing affordable to lower-income households.

 Program 3.3.c      Use Permit for Multi-Family Development
                    The City currently has a Use Permit requirement for multi-family developments
                    consisting of eight or more units in the City’s multi-family zones (R-3 and R-4).
                    While the City is relying heavily on mixed-use development in commercial zones to
                    accommodate its need for lower-income households, several high-density residential
                    opportunity sites allowing capacity above the seven unit threshold have been
                    identified in the inventory. To ensure the City’s permit process is not an
                    unreasonable constraint on the potential development of these sites, the City will
                    process a Zoning Code amendment to eliminate the Use Permit requirement for
                    multi-family developments in the R-3 and R-4 zones.

                    reduction opportunities, such as:
                        •    Tandem Parking. Allow for tandem parking for single-family dwellings and
                             individual mobile homes upon meeting appropriate performance criteria.
                        •    Shared Parking. Where two or more uses have distinct and differing peak
                             traffic usage periods the required number of parking spaces may be reduced
                             through Use Permit approval.
                        •    Low Vehicle-Ownership Reduced Parking Requirement. Allow for a
                             reduction in parking spaces for uses that serve tenants with low vehicle

 4. Needs Assessment
 When preparing a housing element, jurisdictions must evaluate both existing and future housing needs
 for all income groups. This Chapter analyzes demographic and housing characteristics that influence
 the demand for and availability of housing. The analyses form a foundation for establishing programs
 and policies to address identified housing needs.
 Data sources for the Needs Assessment include the U.S. Census Bureau, the California Department of
 Finance, the California Employment Development Department, the Association of Monterey Bay Area
 Governments (AMBAG), and other public or private sources. These data sources are helpful in
 assessing existing conditions, providing a comparison with historical data, and forecasting future
 conditions.
 4.1 Demographic Characteristics
 Housing needs in the City of Pacific Grove are greatly influenced by population and employment
 trends. The following section provides a summary of the changes to the population size and age,
 household composition, the racial/ethnic composition of City residents, and employment trends.
 1.     Population
 According to the California Department of Finance, the Pacific Grove population in 2015 was
 estimated to be 15,388. Following a 22% population increase in the early 1970s, Pacific Grove saw only
 slight fluctuations in the overall population from 1975 to 2010. The City has experienced a population
 decrease of 295 persons from 2010 to 2015 (Table 4-1 and Table 4-2).

 The neighboring cities of Carmel-by-the-Sea and Monterey also saw declines in population for the
 period from 2000 to 2015. The County as a whole, however, grew by approximately 6% during this
 period, which can be attributed to inland cities including Salinas, Soledad, and the City of King. Refer
 to Table 4-2 for population trends for Pacific Grove, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Monterey, and Monterey
 County.

 2.     Age Characteristics
 Overall, the Pacific Grove population is aging. As of 2010, the median age of Pacific Grove residents
 was 48.1 years, well above the Monterey County median of 32.9 years (Table 4-3).

 A continued aging of population will mean that the City will need to consider the types of services
 provided, maintenance and rehabilitation programs for the existing housing stock, and affordable
 housing for seniors. There are a number of programs and services currently available to the City’s
 existing senior population, including the Meals on Wheels program run by the Sally Griffin Senior
 Center. Housing-related issues are addressed in the policies and programs in Chapter 2.
 3.     Household Characteristics
 Household size and composition are often interrelated and can indicate the type of housing appropriate
 for Pacific Grove residents. The U.S. Census defines a household as all persons living in a single
 housing unit, whether or not they are related. In 2015, the average Pacific Grove household contained

 average household size is significantly lower than that of Monterey County as a whole, with an average
 of 3.22 persons per household.
 As shown in Table 4-4, recent census estimates reported that about 72% of owner households and
 about 75% of renter households were comprised of one or two persons. Less than 4% of owner
 households and only about 6% of renter households had more than 4 persons.

 5.     Employment
 Housing needs are influenced by employment trends. Significant shifts in employment opportunities
 within or around the City can lead to growth in demand for housing in proximity to jobs. The quality or
 level of pay also determines the need for various housing types and prices.
 As shown in Table 4-6, the largest occupational category for Pacific Grove residents was “management,
 business, science, and arts” with about 46% of all employed residents. Service and sales/office
 occupations represented about 21% and 25% of workers, respectively. The unemployment rate for City
 residents was about 4% compared to about 7% for the County as a whole.

 6.     Household Income
 Household income relates directly to the household’s ability to acquire adequate housing. While above-
 moderate-income households have more disposable income to spend on housing, low- and moderate-
 income households are more limited in the range of housing that they can afford. Typically, as the
 income of households decreases the incidence of overpayment and overcrowding increases.
 The Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) establishes housing affordability
 criteria for five income categories based on the 2015 Monterey County median income of $68,700 (see
 Table 4-7).

 4.2 Housing Characteristics
 The following section discusses the state of the housing stock and affordability in Pacific Grove. The
 analysis includes the type, age, and condition of existing housing units, housing market factors including
 vacancy rates and housing costs, and potential housing problems including overpayment, overcrowding,
 and units at risk of converting from affordable to market rate.
 1.     Housing Type and Age
 As of 2015, there were a total of 8,184 housing units in Pacific Grove. As shown in Figure 4-2, the
 majority of the units (58%) were single-family detached. Single-family detached housing is defined as a
 one-unit structure separate from any other house; that is, with open space on all four sides. Multi-family
 housing made up about 35% of the housing stock while mobile homes comprised about 2% of units.
 As shown in Table 4-9, the most common size for owner-occupied units was three bedrooms while
 two-bedrooms was the most common size for rental units.

 2.     Condition of Housing Units
 Households living in substandard conditions are considered to be in need of housing assistance due to
 health and safety threats, even if they are not seeking alternative housing arrangements. Generally, the
 housing stock in the City is in good condition. A citywide exterior housing condition survey was
 conducted in 2006. The survey was funded by a Community Development Block Grant and results
 were used to guide the program structure of the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program. City staff
 surveyed 4,867 housing units by means of door-to-door visual evaluation. Staff ranked properties using
 a points system noting the condition of the unit frontage, foundation, roof, siding, and windows.
 Approximately 83% of the units were found to be sound, 17% were in need of rehabilitation (most
 rehabilitation needs were minor), and less than 1% were in need of demolition. Refer to Table 4-11 for
 housing conditions survey results. It is the opinion of City Code Enforcement and Building
 Department staff that housing conditions have not changed substantially since this survey was
 conducted. High property values create strong incentives for property owners to maintain and
 rehabilitate units when repairs are needed.

 3.     Tenure and Vacancy
 Housing tenure refers to the occupancy of a housing unit – whether the unit is owner-occupied or
 renter-occupied. Housing tenure is influenced by demographic factors (e.g., household composition,
 income, and age of the householder) as well as the cost of housing. According to the 2010 Census,
 approximately 46% of Pacific Grove housing units are owner-occupied. About 14% of all units were
 vacant, with the largest portion of those (8.1%) classified as “Other Vacant” (Table 4-12). Since less
 than 1% of units were reported as “seasonal, recreational or occasional use” it seems likely that many of
 the “other vacant” units may also be second homes.
 Vacancy rates are an indicator of housing supply and demand. Low vacancy rates influence greater
 upward price pressures and higher vacancy rates indicate downward price pressure. A 5% to 6%
 vacancy rate is generally considered healthy. As shown in Table 4-12, the rental vacancy rate in the City
 of Pacific Grove was approximately 2% in 2010.

 5.     Housing Affordability
 To estimate and plan for the supply of affordable housing, the Department of Housing and
 Community Development (HCD) defines four income groups based on a percentage of the county
 median family income (MFI). For 2015, the MFI for Monterey County was $68,700 for a family of four.
 The income groups are defined as follows:
      •   Extremely-Low-Income: 30% or less of MFI;
      •   Very-Low-Income: 31% to 50% of MFI;
 March 2016                                                                                          Page 31

      •   Low-Income: 51% to 80% of MFI;
      •   Moderate-Income: 81% to 120% of MFI; and
      •   Above-Moderate-Income: greater than 120% of MFI.
 Housing affordability in Pacific Grove can be inferred by comparing the cost of owning or renting a
 home with the income levels of households of different sizes. Table 4-16 shows the maximum annual
 income for households in the various income groups based on MFI. It also shows the maximum
 affordable monthly rental payment and the estimated maximum affordable home price based on the
 standard of allocating no more than 30% (as established by HUD) of monthly household income to
 housing costs (including utilities, taxes, and insurance).
 These statistics show that most for-sale homes in Pacific Grove are well out of the range of households
 earning a moderate-income or less. Rental prices are more affordable to households with incomes at
 low- and moderate-income levels, although many households have difficulty finding suitable housing
 without overpayment or overcrowding.

 6.     Overpayment
 According to federal government standards, paying more than 30% of monthly household income
 toward housing related expenses is considered to be overpayment. This includes rent or mortgage
 payments and utility costs. High housing costs can cause households to spend a disproportionate
 percentage of their income on housing leaving insufficient income for other basic needs and services,
 such as food and medical attention.
 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) estimates published by HUD (Table 4-17)
 showed that 62% of renters and 81% of homeowners in the extremely-low-income category spent
 more than 30% of their income on housing. About 89% of renters and 74% of homeowners in the
 very-low-income category were overpaying, while about 80% of renters and about one-third of
 homeowners in the low-income category experienced overpayment. Even in the above-moderate-
 income category, overpayment was experienced by about 20% or renters and 27% of homeowners.

 7.     Overcrowding
 Overcrowding is defined as more than one person per room in a single unit, not including kitchens and
 bathrooms. A severely overcrowded housing unit is defined as one with more than 1.5 persons per
 room. Overcrowding can affect public facilities and services, reduce the quality of the physical
 environment, and create conditions that contribute to deterioration. Overcrowding can occur when
 housing costs are high relative to income, forcing more than one family to share a single unit or reside
 in a smaller unit. As shown in Table 4-18, less than 1% of owner-occupied units and only about 2% of
 renter-occupied units in Pacific Grove were overcrowded. Although affordability is an issue on the
 Monterey peninsula, it has not resulted in overcrowding in the City of Pacific Grove according to
 recent Census estimates.

 8.      At-Risk Units
 California housing element law requires that the City include a study of deed-restricted low-income
 units that may be at risk of converting to market-rate within ten years of the beginning of the planning
 period (i.e., 2015-2025). There are nine units in Pacific Grove that are at risk of converting to market
 rate in 2017. Refer to Table 4-19 for a description of at-risk units.
 The six units at 1141 Lighthouse Avenue were deed restricted to be affordable to low-income renters
 for 30 years as a condition of the project’s approval. One of the three units at 541 Pine Avenue is deed
 restricted to be affordable to low-income households and two are deed restricted for moderate-income.
 The deed restrictions were put in place for 30 years as part of a density bonus when the units were
 developed.

 Based on market conditions it is estimated that an annual subsidy of $13,400 for the Lighthouse
 Avenue units and $16,100 for the Pine Avenue units would be required to maintain the current
 affordability level for these units if the covenants expire, or a total of approximately $29,500 per year
 for all nine units. Replacement cost (including land) for all nine units is estimated to be approximately
 $4 million. The City will work with the property owners to explore options for maintaining affordability
 by working with the County to target Section 8 vouchers for the units, or providing rehabilitation funds
 for improvements. If the City is not able to maintain unit affordability through working with the
 property owner, it will notify tenants of assistance options and explore opportunities to assist in the
 development of replacement units. Program 2.3.d addresses the City’s approach to working to maintain
 the affordability of at-risk units.
 Refer to Section 4.3, Special Needs Groups for a detailed description of program activities. As stated in
 Program 2.2.2, the City will continue to seek funding to continue Program activities. Housing Division
 staff worked closely to assist subsidy recipients to ensure that they obtain new assistance or find
 alternative affordable housing.
 9.      Coastal Zone
 California State law (Government Code §65590) requires that communities located within Coastal
 Zones provide an additional analysis of affordable housing units. The analysis must document existing
 units as well as units constructed (after January 1, 1982), demolished, and replaced within three miles of
 the Coastal Zone. Because the City’s entire housing stock is located within three miles of the coastal
 zone, this analysis of affordable units is applicable Citywide.

 The City has an inventory of 68 affordable units for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households,
 all of which were constructed after 1982. See Table 4-20 for a complete list. During the previous
 planning periods, one affordable unit was replaced, demolished, or converted. The deed restriction
 expired in 2002 and the unit converted to market rate.

 4.3 Special Needs Groups
 Certain segments of the population encounter more difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due
 to special circumstances. Special needs may be related to one’s employment type and income, family
 characteristics, medical condition or disability, or household characteristics. This section provides an
 overview of the special needs population in Pacific Grove including persons with disabilities, seniors,
 female-headed households, large households, homeless persons, and residents employed in farming.
 1.     Persons with Disabilities
 A disability is defined broadly by the U.S. Census as a physical, mental, or emotional condition that lasts
 over a long period of time and makes it difficult to live independently. Special needs for access and
 affordability can make it difficult for persons with disabilities to find adequate housing. According to
 recent Census estimates, approximately 12% of non-institutionalized City residents reported some type
 of disability (Table 4-21). As might be expected, those aged 65 and over generally reported the highest
 disability rates. Approximately 26% of seniors reported some type of disability, compared to 10% for
 persons between age 18 and 64. The most frequently reported disability for seniors was an ambulatory
 difficulty (15% of the senior population). Housing opportunities for those with disabilities can be
 maximized through housing assistance programs and providing universal design features such as
 widened doorways, ramps, lowered countertops, single-level units and ground floor units.

 Developmental Disabilities
 As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an individual
 that:
         •   Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
             impairments;
         •   Is manifested before the individual attains age 18;
         •   Is likely to continue indefinitely;

          •   Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major
              life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-
              direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency; and
          •   Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or
              generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or
              extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
 The Census does not record developmental disabilities as a separate category of disability. According to
 the U.S. Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the
 population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many developmentally
 disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More
 severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The
 most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention
 and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first
 issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living
 situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
 The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based
 services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a
 statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based
 facilities. The San Andreas Regional Center (SARC) located in Campbell (http://www.sarc.org/)
 provides services for people with developmental disabilities in Monterey, San Benito, Santa Clara, and
 Santa Cruz counties. The SARC is a private, non-profit community agency that contracts with local
 businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their
 families. As of 2014, SARC served approximately 100 clients living in Pacific Grove (zip code 93950)
 according to data compiled by the Department of Housing and Community Development.
 There is no charge for diagnosis and assessment for eligibility. Once eligibility is determined, most
 services are free regardless of age or income. There is a requirement for parents to share the cost of 24-
 hour out-of-home placements for children under age 18. This share depends on the parents' ability to
 pay. There may also be a co-payment requirement for other selected services.
 Regional centers are required by law to provide services in the most cost-effective way possible. They
 must use all other resources, including generic resources, before using any regional center funds. A
 generic resource is a service provided by an agency that has a legal responsibility to provide services to
 the general public and receives public funds for providing those services. Some generic agencies may
 include the local school district, county social services department, Medi-Cal, Social Security
 Administration, Department of Rehabilitation and others. Other resources may include natural
 supports. This is help that disabled persons may get from family, friends or others at little or no cost.
 Gateway Center, a non-profit organization based in Pacific Grove, provides residential services and day
 programs for developmentally disabled adults. Gateway Center is recognized as an important service to
 disabled persons throughout Monterey County. The Housing Element includes Program 4.3.b to
 ensure continued support for the organization. In addition, several programs have been included in the
 Housing Element to increase housing accessibility for people with disabilities, including Program 4.1.a
 (using the City’s rehabilitation program to modify dwellings for low-income disabled persons and
 seniors) and Program 4.1.b (adopting a reasonable accommodation policy or ordinance).

 2.     Senior Citizens
 Senior citizens (age 65 and over) are considered a special needs group because they are more likely to
 have fixed incomes and often have special needs related to housing location and construction. Because
 of limited mobility, seniors typically need to have access to public facilities (e.g., medical and shopping)
 and public transit. In terms of housing construction, seniors may need ramps, handrails, elevators,
 lower cabinets and counters, and special security devices to allow for greater self-protection.
 According to recent Census estimates (Table 4-22), approximately 43% of owner households and 21%
 of renter households in Pacific Grove were headed by seniors. The number of elderly residents is
 expected to grow given that seniors are the fastest-growing age groups in California.

 In an effort to meet the needs of lower-income senior households, the City of Pacific Grove
 collaborated in the development of Vista Point Apartments. Vista Point was opened for occupancy in
 2006 and offers 48 rental units affordable to very-low- and low-income seniors. The Housing Element
 includes several policies and programs on maintenance and rehabilitation, reasonable accommodation,
 and affordable housing to address the potential needs of seniors.
 3.     Large Households
 A household of five or more persons is considered to be a large family. Large households are
 considered a special needs group because they may experience difficulty in finding suitable housing
 units. Renter households, in particular, are less likely to find units with three or more bedrooms.
 According to recent Census estimates, only about 4% of owner households and about 6% of renter
 households had five or more persons (Table 4-23).

 4.     Female-Headed Households
 Female-headed households are considered to be a special needs group due to the comparatively low
 rates of home ownership, lower income levels, and disproportionately high poverty rates experienced
 by this group. According to recent Census estimates, about 6% of owner households and 13% of renter
 households were headed by a female (Table 4-24). A number of policies and programs in the Housing
 Element are targeted at providing safe, affordable housing within walking distance to services and
 transportation will help to address this special needs population.

 5.     Homelessness
 The housing needs of the homeless are more difficult to measure and assess than those of any other
 population subgroup. Since these individuals have no permanent addresses, they are less likely to be
 counted in the Census, and since they are also unlikely to have stable employment, the market provides
 them with few housing opportunities. Those in need of emergency shelter include victims of domestic
 violence, persons displaced from their homes by disasters such as fires, tenants who have been evicted
 from rental housing, veterans, and “runaways.”
 The County conducted a point-in-time count and prepared a series of independent homeless peer
 interviews as part of the 2015 Monterey County Homeless Census and Survey. This survey used two
 methods for data collection: a point-in-time count on January 28, 2015 and a series of independent
 March 2016                                                                                             Page 39

 homeless peer interviews, as recommended by HUD. The 2015 Monterey County Homeless Point-in-
 Time Census and Survey 1 counted 1,630 unsheltered homeless people and an additional 678 people
 living in emergency shelters, transitional housing, and domestic violence shelters. The final estimate of
 the 2015 Monterey County Homeless Census and Survey is 2,308 persons. Of those, 13 unsheltered
 persons were identified as living in Pacific Grove.
 The Coalition of Homeless Service Providers’ 2014 Monterey County Homeless Services Resource
 Guide identifies emergency shelters, community kitchens, transitional housing, rental support, and
 ancillary services for homeless individuals. The guide identifies the following resources in Monterey
 County:
       •    Emergency Shelters – Franciscan Workers-Women Alive!; Interim; Inc. (Manzanita House and
            MC Home); Pajaro Rescue Mission; Salvation Army-Frederiksen House; Shelter Outreach Plus
            (Salinas Shelter and Seaside Shelter); Victory Mission; and YWCA-Lawson House.
       •    Permanent Supportive Housing – Central Coast HIV/AIDS Services; Interim; Inc. (Sandy
            Shores; Acacia House; Casa de Paloma; and Sunflower Gardens)
       •    Transitional Housing - Community Human Services (Safe Passage and Elm House); Interim;
            Inc. (Shelter Cove and Bridge House); HACM—Pueblo Del Mar; Salvation Army—Casa de Las
            Palmas; Shelter Outreach Plus (Homeward Bound; Lexington Court; and Men in Transition);
            Sun Street Centers—Seven Suns; and Veterans Transition Center—Transition Project.
 United Way’s 2-1-1 Community Resources database can also help link homeless persons to housing and
 supportive services, such as rental and utility assistance, food distribution, shelter, and information and
 referral.
 While homelessness is not a significant issue in the City (13 homeless people counted in 2015), the City
 recognizes that homelessness is a problem regionally and is committed to ending chronic homelessness.
 To this end, policies and programs ranging from cooperating in regional efforts to identifying funding
 sources for shelters and affordable housing are included in this Housing Element. The City has also
 included Program 4.2.a to address the requirements of SB 2 (Homeless Shelters and Transitional
 Housing). The City also supported the One Starfish Safe Parking & Support Services project which
 allows homeless women with children and single women (up to 5 vehicles) to park a recreational
 vehicle in a church parking lot (one location) temporarily (30 days) while searching for permanent
 housing.
 6.       Farm Workers
 Farm workers are defined as those whose primary incomes are earned through seasonal agricultural
 work. Recent Census estimates reported that 45 residents of Pacific Grove were employed in the
 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, and Mining industries. Census data does not specify the
 number of persons who are employed as farm workers and it is assumed that only a small percentage of
 persons employed in this industry are involved in active agricultural production and harvest. In
 addition, there is no farming activity in the City and agriculture is not a permitted use in any zoning
 district. Therefore, although farm worker housing is an acute need at the County level, there is no
 apparent or recognized need for farm worker housing in the City of Pacific Grove.

 5. Land Availability and Housing Resources
 This Chapter addresses the resources available for the development, improvement, and preservation of
 housing in Pacific Grove. This includes:
       •     An evaluation of the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the 2015 - 2023 planning
             period.
       •     A sites inventory and analysis, which details the land suitable for residential development.
       •     An overview of the financial and administrative resources available for developing and
             implementing City housing programs.
 5.1 Regional Housing Needs Allocation
 California law requires the Department of Housing and Community Development to project statewide
 housing needs and allocate the need to each region in the State. After consulting with the Association
 of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG), HCD provides the regional need to AMBAG, which
 then distributes the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) to the cities and counties within the
 AMBAG region. AMBAG allocates housing production goals for the cities and counties based on their
 projected share of the region’s population growth and other factors.
 The projected housing needs in the RHNA are categorized by income based on standards for very-low-
 , low-, moderate-, and above-moderate-income households as established by the U.S. Department of
 Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (California Health and Safety Code §50079.5).
 Local governments can employ a variety of development strategies to accommodate their RHNA
 housing production goals, as provided in Government Code §65583(c)(1). In addition to identifying
 vacant or underutilized land resources, local governments can address a portion of the adequate sites
 requirement through the provision of second units.
 As shown in Table 5-1, the Pacific Grove share of the RHNA for the 2015-2023 planning period is 115
 units including 28 very-low-income, 18 low-income, 21 moderate-income, and 48 above-moderate-
 income units. Because the RHNA period began January 1, 2014, any units completed or approved since
 that date are credited toward the City’s inventory of sites. During 2014-15, five primary units were
 constructed or permitted in Pacific Grove. These units were assumed to be market rate, thus affordable
 only to households with an above-moderate income. After accounting for permit and construction
 activity in the period from January 2014 through December 2015 the City has a remaining RHNA of
 110 units as seen in Table 5-1.

 5.2 Site Inventory and Analysis
 Local governments can employ a variety of development strategies to meet the RHNA housing
 production goals, as provided in California Government Code §65583(c)(1). In addition to identifying
 vacant or underutilized land resources, local governments can address a portion of their adequate sites
 requirements through the provision of second units. Table 5-2 and the following discussion
 summarizes the vacant land inventory, second unit potential, and underutilized and opportunity sites.
 This analysis demonstrates that the City has adequate sites with appropriate zoning to accommodate
 the RHNA in all income categories.

 2.       Vacant Sites
 State law governing the preparation of housing elements emphasizes the importance of an adequate
 land supply by requiring that each housing element “...identify adequate sites... to facilitate and
 encourage the development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels...” (California
 Government Code §65583(c)(1)).
 The vacant land inventory (see Table 5-3 and Appendix B) identifies the realistic potential for 148 units,
 which accounts for site limitations such as environmental constraints and exceeds the City’s remaining
 RHNA allocation in all income categories. While many of the vacant parcels are expected to
 accommodate moderate- and above-moderate-income households, there are several sites that are
 appropriate for high-density housing units for very-low- and low-income households, accommodating
 approximately 81 units. The City will continue to work with owners of these properties, particularly
 those allowing higher densities, to facilitate affordable housing development where feasible (see
 Programs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.a, 2.3.c and 2.3.f).

 3.      Second Unit Potential
 From 1983 to 1999, the City permitted an average of three secondary units per year. From 2000 to
 2010, the City permitted an average of 1.4 units per year. However, because water resources have
 limited construction in recent years, it is assumed that the 1983 to 1999 average better represents
 market demand and realistic construction potential. Using this historical average, it is assumed that one
 second unit per year will be permitted during the 2015-2023 planning period.
 A 2008 analysis of the parcel inventory in Pacific Grove found potential for over 2,600 additional
 secondary units in Pacific Grove, a reduction of about 900 units from the 1994 General Plan build out
 potential. The analysis narrowed potential properties based on existing secondary units and the
 following parameters for minimum lot sizes:
      •     Located in the R-1 or R-1-H zones and over 4,000 square feet; or
      •     Located in the R-1-B-2 zone and over 6,000 square feet; or
      •     Located in the R-1-B-3 zone and over 10,000 square feet.
 Corner lots less than 5,000 square feet were not considered due to setback restrictions that would make
 development unlikely. The study also did not consider properties in the R-1-B-4 zone due to Local
 Coastal Program land use restrictions.
 March 2016                                                                                                Page 43

 Second units approved from 2003 to 2010 were deed restricted for moderate-income households, as
 prescribed in the Second Unit Ordinance. Based on the changes proposed in Program 2.4, it is assumed
 that most future second units will be deed restricted to be affordable to low-income households as the
 program describes a revision to the Second Unit Ordinance that would relax development standards in
 order to incentivize the development of second units that are deed restricted for low-income
 households.
 4.      Underutilized and Opportunity Sites
 Although there are sufficient vacant sites to fully accommodate the City’s RHNA allocation,
 underutilized opportunity sites could accommodate approximately 52 additional lower-income units
 (see Table 5-4 and Appendix B, Figure B-2). These underutilized sites include seven High Density
 Residential parcels that are developed at a substantially lower density than permitted, as well as five
 contiguous parcels in the Forest Avenue Commercial Area. These C-1 parcels range in size from 0.15 to
 0.23 acre and all have one existing residential structure and deep setbacks from Forest Avenue (see
 Figure 5-1). There is potential for these sites to be combined and developed for multi-family or mixed-
 use. Given consideration for the existing units, these parcels could reasonably accommodate an
 additional 14 units. The unit estimate is conservative as it assumes that the existing five residential
 structures on the site would remain in place. Under current zoning, the site could accommodate
 additional units if the existing units are demolished.

 These underutilized parcels provide additional opportunities for affordable housing that exceed the
 City’s assigned share of regional needs. As noted in Program 2.3.e, the City will continue to work with
 owners of underutilized properties to facilitate their development for low- and moderate-income
 housing. The Housing Plan (Chapter 3) includes several programs to work with owners of underutilized
 sites (Programs 2.3.a, 2.3.b, 2.3.c, 2.3.e, and 2.3.f) to stimulate investment in the downtown area and
 encourage mixed-use and higher density residential development in the Forest Hill Commercial
 District.
 5.3 Financial and Administrative Resources
 Developing affordable housing in a high-priced market, such as in Pacific Grove, requires access to
 local, State, and federal funding, as well as organizations with the expertise to build and manage
 affordable housing. The following section provides an overview of financial and administrative
 resources available for affordable housing development and conservation in Pacific Grove.
 1.     Financial Resources
 City of Pacific Grove Housing Assistance Programs
 The City of Pacific Grove offers several programs to help residents improve and maintain their homes
 and aid low-income renters in obtaining affordable housing. Programs are administered by the Housing
 Division of the Community Development Department and include the Housing Rehabilitation Loan
 Program, Emergency Home Repair Loan Program, Rental Assistance Program, Private Sewer Lateral
 Program, and Poet’s Perch. Information regarding these programs is posted on the City website
 (www.cityofpacificgrove.org/housing).

        Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program
              The City makes funds available to assist low-income residents in repairing and upgrading
              their homes through the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program. The City’s current portfolio
              consists of 44 loans valued at $1.8 million. Over the past 10 years the City processed 37
              loans ranging in value from $2,085 to $165,000. By 2017 the City anticipates providing
              seven to ten additional loans.
              The City continually works with the State Department of Housing and Community
              Development (HCD) and other community partners to obtain funding for the loan
              program. These partnerships have contributed to the ongoing success of the program. In
              the mid-1980s, the program began receiving grant funding and has benefited from over $4
              million in State and Federal funding since that time. Other past community partners have
              included local banks, realtors, appraisers, title companies and newspapers. Partners have
              provided cash grants and discounted services for the program. From the year 2000 through
              June 2010, a total of $448,798 of local and private match contributions were provided to the
              loan program.
        Emergency Home Repair Loan Program
              The Emergency Home Repair Loan Program offers loans of up to $10,000 for emergency
              home repairs such as damaged water or heating and cooling systems, hazardous electrical
              wiring, defective sewage lines, and leaking roofs. Loans are offered to very-low- and low-
              income Pacific Grove homeowners. Assistance is granted based on the priority and
              eligibility of the emergency.
        Rental Assistance Program
              This Program provided over $445,000 in rent subsidies until 2010 when the program was
              discontinued due to lack of funding.
        Private Sewer Lateral Loan Program
              In 2005, the Pacific Grove City Council approved funding for the Sewer Lateral Loan
              Program. Loan funds are made available to property owners that are voluntarily repairing or
              replacing their private sewer laterals. The loans are granted at 3% interest and there are no
              income restrictions to qualify for the loan. Payment of deferred loans is due upon sale of
              the property or transfer of title. A total of 41 loans have been made under this program
              since 2005.
        Poet’s Perch
              The City-owned residential property at 140 18th Street is rented to a qualified poet at a
              reduced monthly rent, in exchange for the poet providing poetry-related community service
              to Pacific Grove. The Housing Division facilitates the annual selection process of the poet
              and provides the property management of the home.

 6. Constraints
 Government policies and regulations impact the price and availability of housing and, in particular, the
 provision of affordable housing. Constraints to housing production include development standards,
 fees, permitting procedures, and the lack of available water. Providing infrastructure and services also
 increases the cost of producing housing. One of the greatest constraints to affordable housing
 production is the chronic shortage of State and federal financial assistance.
 This Chapter addresses potential governmental and non-governmental constraints, infrastructure
 constraints, energy conservation, and focuses on mitigation options available to the City to minimize or
 eliminate potential constraints.
 6.1 Governmental Constraints
 Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing. Land use controls, site
 improvement requirements, fees and exactions, permit processing procedures, and various other issues
 constrain the development and improvement of housing.
 1.     Local Land Use Controls
 The Land Use Element of the Pacific Grove General Plan sets forth policies for residential
 development. These land use policies, coupled with zoning regulations, establish land allocations for
 different uses. Housing supply and costs are affected by the amount of land designated for residential
 use, the density at which residential development is permitted, and the standards that govern the
 character of development.
 The 1994 Pacific Grove General Plan applies to all areas of the City except the Coastal Zone, which is
 regulated by the 1989 Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan (LUP). A small portion of the City’s
 existing housing stock is located within the Coastal Zone. Most of the Coastal Zone is built out with
 single-family detached housing, although several vacant lots remain in the Asilomar Dunes area.
 The Zoning Code implements the General Plan. It is a more detailed approach to regulating land use by
 taking development lot-by-lot, based on the General Plan goals, policies, and Land Use Map. The
 General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, as they apply to residential development, are discussed below.
 Development Regulations
 Table 6-1 summarizes the General Plan land use categories and the zoning districts that either allow by-
 right or conditionally permit residential development. Densities greater than 20 units per acre are most
 appropriate for affordable housing. The R-3, R-4, and C-1 zones meet this threshold. Table 6-2
 summarizes residential development standards in Pacific Grove. The development standards are
 reasonable based on regulations in similar communities. In addition, the R-3 and R-4 zones allow

                  The application of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) district allows for flexibility in
                  design and layout to accommodate environmental constraints and a mix of housing types.
                  The PUD district allows for single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, apartment
                  houses, condominiums, and similar forms of common ownership, however, a use permit is
                  required. Densities within the PUD district are set by the General Plan.
         Second Dwelling Units
                  Second units are recognized as a viable housing option in the City of Pacific Grove. The
                  City permits second dwelling units on any residentially-zoned site with ministerial approval,
                  except, pursuant to the local coastal program land use plan, second units are not allowed in
                  the R-1-B-4 Zoning District. A use permit is required for second dwelling units in single-
                  family (R-1) districts that do not meet all of the development standards identified in Table
                  6-5.

                                            Residences.

                  Secondary dwelling units require no discretionary approval, unless exceptions to the
                  standards in Table 6-5 are required. City regulations are consistent with State law and the
                  development standards do not constrain the development of second units. However, the
                  City does require that the primary unit be owner-occupied. Program 2.4 is included in the
                  Housing Plan to consider revised standards to encourage the development of second units.
         Mixed-Use
                  Mixed-use development can provide new employment and housing opportunities for
                  residents by permitting commercial uses on lower floors and residential units on the upper
                  floors. Mixed-use development can enhance economic viability, pedestrian-oriented
                  character, and the commercial environment. Zoning regulations allow for both commercial
                  and residential on the same site within the C-1, C-1-T, and C-2 districts, however, there are

              no explicit development standards for this type of land use. In the C-1 and C-2 districts, the
              Zoning Code states that where there is a mixed usage and over 50% of the street-level
              frontage is devoted to the commercial use, the commercial district standards shall apply.
              Additionally, the City does include approval of mixed-use in conjunction with the housing
              development in the Density Bonus Program incentives.
        Mobilehomes and Mobilehome Parks
              State law requires that mobile and manufactured homes be allowed on parcels zoned for
              conventional single-family units. These units cannot be regulated by any planning fees or
              review processes not applicable to conventional single-family dwellings. However, the
              architectural design of manufactured or mobilehomes can be regulated by the City.
              Under the City’s zoning regulations, mobilehomes are permitted by-right in the R-1, R-1-H,
              R-2, and M-H districts. Mobilehome parks are permitted through the application of the M-
              H combined district, however, mobilehome parks in the M-H district must obtain a use
              permit. The R-3 and R-4 districts do not allow for mobilehomes or mobilehome parks
              unless it is combined with the M-H district. Program 3.4.c includes a commitment to review
              zoning regulations for mobile homes and manufactured housing, and initiate a Zoning Code
              amendment to ensure conformance with state law.
 Parking Standards
 The City’s parking requirements are based upon unit type and size. As shown in Table 6-6, parking
 requirements typically range from one to two spaces per single-family residential unit. Multi-family
 residential units have a reduced requirement based on the size of unit, but generally average two spaces
 per unit. Where the M-H district is combined with other R districts, parking standards are based on the
 combined residential district. Reductions in parking spaces are allowed for uses that serve tenants with
 low vehicle-ownership rates, such as convalescent housing, rest homes, and rooming homes. Program
 3.4.a proposes shared and tandem parking requirements to provide for a greater variety of parking
 options.

 Affordable Housing Density Bonuses and Concessions/Incentives
 To achieve affordable housing through density increases, the City implements the State’s density bonus
 program (Government Code §65915) through Chapter 23.79 (Density Bonus Regulations) of the
 Zoning Code. Under state density bonus law, applicants are eligible for a range of density bonuses up
 to 35%, based on the percentage of affordable units in a development. Applicants are also eligible for a
 land donation density bonus. Jurisdictions are required to offer incentives (reductions in parking, for
 example), based on the percentage of affordable units in a development. Program 2.3.a includes a
 commitment to update City regulations in compliance with State density bonus law.
 2.      Local Processing and Permit Procedures
 Permit Processes and Timelines
 As a coastal community with unique and historic architectural character and environmental constraints,
 the City of Pacific Grove requires different levels of architectural and planning review for housing
 projects depending on the type, size, location, and historical designation, if applicable. Review ensures
 that the proposed project meets applicable City regulations, State environmental laws, and applicable
 building standards. The City’s development review and permitting processes for residential
 developments are described below.
 Table 6-7 displays the typical timelines for approvals and permits for the City of Pacific Grove.

 the permit approval process must conform to the Permit Streamlining Act (California Government Code
 §65920 et. seq.), housing proposed in Pacific Grove is subject to one or more of the following review
 processes: architectural design review, use permit or variance control, environmental review, and
 building permit approval.

 Single-family units are permitted by-right within the zoning districts noted in Table 6-4 on page 52.
 New single-family dwellings must obtain an Architectural Permit issued by the Architectural Review
 Board.

 Multi-family dwellings and dwelling groups are permitted by-right in the zoning districts noted in Table
 6-4 on page 52, if the project is less than or equal to seven units. Projects with eight or more units
 require a Use Permit, which are approved by the Planning Commission (see Table 6-8). Planning
 Commission decisions may be appealed to the City Council. All proposed multi-family projects must
 obtain an Architectural Permit as issued by the Architectural Review Board.
 Use Permit findings. The planning commission may approve a use permit only after first making the
 following findings (PGMC Sec. 23.70.080.a.4):
          (A) The proposed use is allowed with a use permit within the applicable zoning district and
          complies with all applicable provisions of these regulations;
          (B) The proposed use is consistent with the general plan, the local coastal program, and any
          applicable specific plan;
          (C) The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use will not, under the circumstances
          of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing
          or working in the neighborhood of the proposed use;
          (D) The use, as described and conditionally approved, will not be detrimental or injurious to
          property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city; and
          (E) The location, size, design, and operating characteristics of the proposed use are compatible
          with the existing and future land uses in the vicinity.
 Program 3.3.c includes a commitment to review the use permit requirement for larger multi-family
 developments to determine whether it poses an unreasonable constraint on housing production and
 amend development review procedures if necessary to mitigate any constraints.
 The City achieves timely permit processing that does not constrain residential development by
 implementing measures that streamline the process, as needed. The City adopted an ordinance in 2010
 to streamline and clarify permit procedures in the Zoning Code and provides handouts to identify
 submittal requirements and procedures for the applicant to follow in order to ensure efficient
 processing. The City’s practice (for Architectural Approvals, Historic Preservation Permits, Use
 Permits, and Variances) is that once an application is deemed complete, it is scheduled for hearing
 within one month.
 Portions of the City are located within the Coastal Zone and thereby require additional permit
 approvals not under City control. The City does not have a certified local coastal program, so applicants
 are required to directly apply to the Coastal Commission for Coastal Development Permits until the
 LCP process is completed (anticipated in 2016).
 In the Coastal Zone, with the exception of the Asilomar Dunes area, most existing developed parcels
 with remodels or tear down and rebuild projects are typically eligible for Coastal Development Permit
 waivers. The waiver process takes approximately 60 to 90 days on average, depending on timing of the
 application submittal with the California Coastal Commission meetings. Actual Coastal Development
 Permits would average approximately 90 to 120 days once the CCC has deemed the application
 complete.

 Environmental Review
 As required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City’s permit processing
 procedures include an assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the proposed projects. The
 majority of projects in the City meet the requirements for Class 1, Class 3, or Class 31 (historic and
 consistent with Secretary of the Interior Standards) categorical exemptions. If a project requires a
 negative declaration (ND), mitigated negative declaration (MND), or environmental impact report
 (EIR), additional processing and time is required; however, very few projects require an ND or MND,
 and no residential projects have required an EIR in the past 10 years. Environmental regulations can
 protect the public from significant environmental degradation and prevent the development on
 inappropriate sites. Environmental regulations also provide the public an opportunity to comment on
 project impacts. This process does, however, increase the time and cost of project approval.
 Architectural Review
 The purpose of Architectural Review is to promote the orderly and harmonious development of the
 City and to protect the architectural heritage of Pacific Grove. The City’s Architectural Review
 Guidelines 2 apply only to single-family homes and include the following considerations:
         •    Neighborhood compatibility
         •    Relationship to site and topography
         •    Mass and scale of a structure
         •    Materials, texture and color
 Architectural Review Board approval is required for new construction of, or major exterior
 modification or addition to, any building or structure except as follows:
         •    Projects eligible for Administrative Architectural Permits and Architectural Design Changes for
              projects not listed on the Historic Resources Inventory (the Architectural Review Board serves
              as an appeal body for these permits).
         •    A second unit requiring a Use Permit if the project is either visually insignificant or not visible
              from any adjacent public street, as determined by the Chief Planner.
 Historic Preservation
 The City has approximately 1,300 homes on its Historic Resources Inventory. Modifications to these
 homes are regulated by Municipal Code Chapter 23.76 (Historic Preservation). The protection of these
 resources is currently overseen by the Historic Resources Committee and Architectural Review Board,
 in compliance with the California State Historic Building Code (SHBC), which provides alternative
 building regulations for the rehabilitation, preservation, restoration or relocation of structures
 designated as cultural resources and CEQA guidelines.
 The Architectural Review Board may grant Historic Preservation Permits for exceptions to zoning
 district regulations when such an exception is necessary to permit the preservation or restoration of, or
 improvements to, a building listed on the Historic Resources Inventory. Such exceptions may include,
 but not be limited to, parking, yards, height and coverage regulations. Such exceptions do not include
 approval of uses not otherwise allowed by the zoning district regulations.

 The Architectural Review Board is required to review and approve any addition to, or major exterior
 alteration of, buildings listed in the City of Pacific Grove Historic Resources Inventory. Minor
 alterations and projects eligible for an Administrative Architectural Permit may be reviewed and
 approved at the Staff review level. Architectural Review Board approval for major historic projects adds
 additional fees to the development process and is considered to be a potential constraint to the
 redevelopment within the existing housing stock. However, these are important regulations for historic
 preservation. In the unlikely event that a historic structure was proposed for affordable housing, this
 would need to be taken into account.
 Site Plan Review Committee
 The purpose of the Site Plan Review Committee (SPRC) is to encourage well-designed multi-family
 residential, commercial, and industrial development. The SPRC studies the siting of proposed
 construction and its impact upon the existing topography and natural vegetation, and the relationship
 of proposed construction to existing public and private improvements in the immediate area.
 The SPRC consists of the Chief Planner (chairperson), City Engineer, Fire Chief, and Chief Building
 Official, or their representatives. The SPRC reviews and comments on lot line adjustments, siting and
 lot coverage for proposed projects located in the coastal zone, and projects valued at $50,000 or more.
 SPRC review does not apply to single-family residences outside of the coastal zone, interior alterations
 and remodels that do not involve a change in occupancy, or exterior alterations that do not involve an
 increase in floor area.
 Housing in the Coastal Zone
 A portion of the Pacific Grove housing stock is located within the Coastal Zone. Existing residential
 neighborhoods in the Coastal Zone include the Pacific Grove Retreat, a portion of the Pacific Grove
 Beach Tract along Mermaid Avenue, Monarch Pines Mobile Home Park, and Asilomar Dunes.
 California Government Code §65590 requires that housing units for low- and moderate-income residents be
 provided whenever possible, be protected where they currently exist, and be replaced when demolished.
 According to State law, the Housing Element must include a discussion of the jurisdiction’s progress in
 implementing coastal housing requirements.
 The Pacific Grove Retreat and the Mermaid Avenue neighborhoods have special characteristics that the
 City wishes to preserve. The Retreat is considered a “special community” under Section 30253 of the
 Coastal Act. This section requires that the unique characteristics of special communities be protected.
 To meet this requirement, the City controls demolitions of historic buildings and exterior modifications
 to all buildings in this area. The City also intends to maintain the Mermaid Avenue area as an
 architecturally unique neighborhood.
 The Monarch Pines Mobile Home Park has been designated for mobile home park use in order to
 preserve this affordable housing community.
 Asilomar Dunes is only partially developed. In order to preserve the unique ecological features of the
 dune area, the City has adopted policies in its Local Coastal Program to restrict development to single-
 family dwellings on one-half- to one-acre lots. Secondary units are prohibited in this area by the LUP.
 March 2016                                                                                         Page 59

 The City approved the development of a 49-unit low-income senior housing project on a site adjacent
 to Chase Park in the Coastal Zone, Vista Point Apartments. Construction of the project was completed
 in 2006.
 3.     Codes and Enforcement
 The Pacific Grove Building Code is based on the 2013 California Building Code (CBC), which
 determines the minimum construction requirements for the State of California. The CBC ensures safe
 housing and is not considered a constraint to housing production. The City’s Building Official responds
 to building code related problems on a complaint-driven basis, as well as through an exterior inspection
 at the time of property transfers.
 On- and Off-Site Improvement Requirements
 Site improvement costs include the cost of providing access to a site, clearing the site, and grading the
 pad area. In the case of a subdivision, such costs may also include major subdivision improvements
 such as road construction and installation of sewer, water and other utilities. Several variables affect the
 amount of such costs, including site topography and proximity to established roads, sewer, and water
 lines.
 The City requires that curbs, gutters and sidewalks be installed along the frontage of every lot on which
 new construction or significant alteration occurs. The absence of curbs and gutters may contribute to
 unsafe pedestrian and vehicular travel. In addition, potential flooding problems may result due to the
 lack of infrastructure improvements. Curb, gutter, and sidewalk improvements are typical of all cities in
 California and do not impose a significant constraint to the development of housing in Pacific Grove.
 Fees and Exactions
 Fees for developing residential housing in Pacific Grove include planning, building, and regional impact
 fees. Refer to Table 6-9 for typical fee costs. The City’s fees do not exceed the amount required to
 administer the processing of such applications and do not exceed that of other similar jurisdictions.
 Moreover, the City does not currently impose City impact fees (e.g. traffic, parks).

  Source: City of Pacific Grove 2015
 Total fees are estimated to comprise about 4% of the purchase price for a single-family unit and
 approximately 5% of a multi-family apartment unit. Given the prices of housing in the City and fees in
 other jurisdictions, fees charged for residential development are not a significant factor contributing to
 the high housing costs in the City.
 4.       Housing Constraints for Persons with Disabilities
 Housing element law requires localities to include the following in the preparation and adoption of a
 housing element:
       •     As part of a governmental constraints analysis, an element must analyze potential and actual
             constraints upon the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with
             disabilities and demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental constraints that hinder a
             locality from meeting the need for housing for persons with disabilities (§65583(a)(4)).
       •     As part of the required constraints program, the element must include programs that remove
             constraints or provide reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons with
             disabilities (§65583(c)(3)).
 The definition of a reasonable accommodation is when a municipal jurisdiction allows a deviation from
 the strict interpretation of zoning standards for someone with a demonstrated need resulting from a
 disability.
 Table 6-10 reviews the City’s land use policies, permitting practices, and building codes with respect to
 State and federal fair housing laws for persons with disabilities.

 Land Use - Persons with Disabilities
 The General Plan and Zoning Code identify group quarters, rooming houses, and boarding houses as
 housing options for special needs groups. Group quarters are residential living arrangements, other
 than the usual house, apartment or mobile home, in which two or more unrelated persons share living
 quarters and cooking facilities. Group quarters includes institutional group quarters, such as licensed
 residential care facilities for 25 or more persons and orphanages, and non-institutional group quarters,
 such as dormitories, shelters, and large boarding houses. Rooming houses and boarding houses are
 permitted by CUP in the higher-density residential districts (R-3 and R-4) to allow for dwellings that
 accommodate a non-transient occupancy where lodging and/or meals for three or more persons are
 provided for compensation.
 The General Plan applies the Group Quarters designation on the General Plan Land Use Map to
 existing group quarters facilities: Canterbury Woods, Forest Hill Manor, Del Monte Rest Home, and
 Gateway Center. Group Quarters are currently limited to the boundaries shown on the Land Use Map.
 The General Plan proposed the revision of the Zoning Code to reflect that residential care facilities for
 six or fewer persons are allowed in any Residential district, and that residential care facilities for seven
 to 24 persons are allowed in multi-family districts with a use permit. Under the current zoning group
 quarters are permitted in those areas of residential districts defined on the general plan land use map,
 only with the approval of a use permit (Section 23.64.065, Use Permit - Group quarters). The Zoning
 Code has not yet been updated to be consistent with the General Plan and State law.
 According to the Health and Safety Code Sections 1267.8, 1566.3, 1568.08, the City is required to treat
 licensed group homes and residential care facilities with six or fewer residents no differently than other
 family dwellings of the same type in the same zone. “Six or fewer persons” does not include the
 operator, the operator’s family or persons employed as staff. Local agencies must allow these licensed
 residential care facilities in any area zoned for residential use, and may not require licensed residential
 care facilities for six or fewer persons to obtain conditional use permits or variances that are not
 required of other family dwellings. In order to ensure consistency with State Law, the Zoning Code will
 be amended to address this issue (Program 4.2.a).
 The City supports the right of disabled persons and senior citizens to five-year rental occupancy with
 Chapter 23.29 (Condominium and Community Housing Conversions). Permanently disabled and senior
 citizen tenants are entitled to continue to rent a property planned for conversion, for a period of five
 years. It is unlawful for any developer or owner to evict or constructively evict any tenant for purposes
 of depriving the tenant of these benefits. It is unlawful for any proposed conversion to displace a
 significant percentage of low- and moderate-income or senior citizen tenants, tenants with children, and
 a significant number of low- and moderate-income rental units from the City’s housing stock at a time
 when no equivalent housing is readily available in the Pacific Grove area.

 City Activities to Limit Discrimination and Provide Special Needs Housing
 The City acts as an information station to refer those with complaints of discrimination or violations of
 Fair Housing Laws to the California State Fair Housing Office. The City effectively refers people
 experiencing housing discrimination to the appropriate agencies and in distributing fair housing
 information to the public. Additionally, the City has established an Accessibility Board of Appeals to
 hear and decide appeals of orders, decisions or determinations made by the Building Official
 concerning handicap accessibility, as provided in Title 24, California Code of Regulations.
 In addition, a 2008 Mayoral Proclamation declared the month of April “Fair Housing Month” in the
 City of Pacific Grove. During the month, the City promotes awareness of fair housing issues through
 activities such as poster and poetry contests.
 Emergency Shelters
 Emergency shelters provide short-term shelter (usually for up to six months of stay) for homeless
 persons or persons facing other difficulties, such as domestic violence. To facilitate the development of
 emergency housing consistent with State law, the City will process an amendment to the Zoning Code
 concurrent with adoption of the Housing Element (see Program 4.2.a).
 Transitional and Supportive Housing
 Transitional housing provides longer-term temporary housing (up to two years) for individuals and
 families who are transitioning to permanent housing. Supportive housing is coupled with services such
 as job training, alcohol and drug abuse programs, and case management for populations in need of
 assistance, such as those suffering from mental illness or substance abuse problems, and the elderly or
 medically frail. Consistent with State law, a zoning amendment will be processed concurrent with
 adoption of the Housing Element update to ensure that transitional and supportive housing are
 permitted in all zones where residential uses are permitted subject only to the same standards as apply
 to dwellings of the same type in the same zone (see Program 4.2.a).
 6.2 Non-Governmental Constraints
 This section examines constraints to producing affordable housing that result from non-governmental
 forces, including traffic congestion, the availability of financing, the price of land, and the cost of
 construction in Pacific Grove.
 1.     Automobile Traffic
 The City is highly dependent on two arterial streets - Lighthouse Avenue and Forest Avenue. These
 streets connect Pacific Grove to neighboring communities and provide access to Highway 1. While
 additional housing development may impact traffic on these and other roads, this Housing Element
 does not change allowable land uses or intensities or cause traffic levels to exceed established level of
 service standards. The traffic impacts of any new residential development or proposed change in land
 use or zoning will be evaluated and addressed through environmental review at the time such actions
 are proposed.

 2.     Availability of Financing
 While banks typically provide construction loans in the range of the “prime rate” plus 2% to 3%,
 lending standards have tightened since the 2008 financial crisis and construction and permanent loans
 have become more difficult to obtain. Affordable housing projects may rely partly on a conventional
 bank loan. However, they more heavily rely on State and federal funding (e.g. low-income housing tax
 credits). Many programs within the State of California exist to provide cities, communities, and counties
 financial assistance in the development, preservation, and rehabilitation of residential development,
 primarily affordable units. The Department of Housing and Community Development identifies and
 provides detailed information on grants and loans available for affordable housing.
 3.     Price of Land
 Land costs vary substantially and are based on a number of factors. The main determinants to land
 value are location, zoning and availability of water. The size of a parcel will also affect price. Land in a
 desirable area zoned for residential uses will likely be more valuable, and thus more expensive, than a
 remote piece of land zoned for agricultural uses. An internet search for vacant residential lots for sale in
 Pacific Grove identified one parcel of approximately 10,000 square feet with a water meter and
 approved plans listed for $665,000.
 4.     Cost of Construction
 Costs incurred in constructing a dwelling unit vary according to the amenities built into the unit,
 materials used, prevailing labor rate, and the difficulty of building on the site. Residential construction
 costs range from $150 (multiple-family) to $200 (single-family) per square foot or more for high-quality
 construction.
 5.     Short-Term Rentals
 In many popular vacation areas such as the Monterey Peninsula, some residential properties are held as
 second homes for occasional use. As a result, a portion of the housing stock is not available for
 purchase or long-term rental. In the past, some property owners have rented their homes, or rooms, on
 a short-term basis to generate extra income. However, with the creation of internet websites (VRBO,
 AirBnB, etc.) where owners market their properties, this type of short-term rental market has expanded
 dramatically. In some communities, there is concern that the substantial growth in the short-term rental
 market created by internet advertising is encouraging more individuals and real estate investment
 entities to purchase properties specifically for short-term rental (as opposed to second homes held for
 occasional use), thereby further reducing the number of homes available for full-time occupancy.
 Effects on the local housing market are difficult to quantify, and may also be viewed as a potential
 governmental constraint since cities have the authority to regulate short-term rentals. In response to
 this concern, Program 2.3.g in Chapter 3 is included to review this issue and consider appropriate
 actions.
 6.3 Infrastructure Constraints
 1.     Water Service
 The greatest constraint on the production of new housing in Pacific Grove is the availability of water.
 Lack of water supply has resulted in very little new housing construction for over a decade. The water

 purveyor to Pacific Grove and other Monterey Peninsula jurisdictions is California-American Water
 (Cal-Am). In 2009, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) approved a Cease and Desist
 Order against Cal-Am as a subsequent enforcement action to SWRCB Order 95-10, which required a
 dramatic reduction in Cal-Am withdrawals from the Carmel River Watershed. Water supplies have been
 extremely limited on the Monterey Peninsula since at least 1995. The other source of water supply to
 Cal-Am’s Monterey District service area is the Seaside Ground Water Basin; however, this source is
 also constrained. In 2006, a final decision was rendered that adjudicated the Seaside Ground Water
 Basin, which required gradual reductions to Cal-Am’s annual extractions from that source to 3,000
 acre-feet per year (Monterey Peninsula Integrated Regional Water Management Plan, 2007).
 The Cal-Am water service area is locally regulated by the Monterey Peninsula Water Management
 District (MPWMD) and as a result of SWRCB Order 95-10, MPWMD established a system of water
 allocations to each jurisdiction to limit new development based on the availability of water. The City
 had a water allocation balance of 0.540 acre-feet as of August 2015. This is the only water available for
 new development or redevelopment until Cal-Am supplies increase and new allocations are made to
 each city. The City of Pacific Grove’s estimated future water demand to satisfy the 1994 General Plan’s
 build-out projections has been estimated at a need for an additional 1,264 AFY. This figure is based in
 part on a maximum potential of 3,426 additional second units, which at this time is considered to be an
 overestimate. Therefore, the long-term demand is likely to be less. However, the availability of water to
 serve new development during the 2015-2023 planning period is uncertain.
 In 2008, the City Council decided that the remaining five acre-feet of water in the City’s allocation from
 the MPWMD should be distributed to the water wait list prior to the enactment of the Cease and
 Desist Order. Over 50 projects were able to proceed with that distribution, including 24 new single-
 family dwellings. The majority of the City’s allocation has now been distributed and a new water wait
 list has been established. There were 12 projects for new single-family dwellings on the wait list as of
 July 2015.
 Without a new water allocation, the City of Pacific Grove will be unable to permit any new housing
 construction, except for the few properties that have sufficient onsite water credits for second units.
 The City is working on projects to reduce the use of potable water where feasible, such as at Pacific
 Grove’s golf course and cemetery, which may eventually result in some additional allocation that could
 be used for residential development (Program 3.1).
 Water conservation efforts put forth by MPWMD and Cal-Am have helped to reduce the average
 family’s usage. Currently, the Monterey Peninsula has the lowest average water usage in the State.
 Although water scarcity and provision of new supply is ultimately beyond the control of the City, the
 City supports efforts to conserve the water supply by ensuring the implementation of water
 conservation measures and MPWMD programs, including:
      •   Conservation Inspections - District staff conducted an intensive inspection program to ensure
          compliance with the conservation regulations. Inspections were focused on change of
          ownership requirements and new construction or remodel water permit requirements and
          conditions.
      •   Code and Permit Provisions - The City’s Municipal Code and MPWMD water permit
          requirements include specific requirements for water conservation in existing and new
          developments such as plumbing fixtures unit allotments.
      •   Regulation Enforcement - The City enforces water conservation requirements mandated by the
          MPWMD (District Regulation XIV) for landscaping, irrigation, hot water storage and bathroom

          fixtures, such as showerheads and toilets. For projects that require building permit approval,
          such as a new construction or a change of ownership, the MPWMD water conservation
          requirements must be met.
 Recent changes in State law mandate the prioritizing of water for affordable housing if water is an issue.
 The City’s share of water resources is internally allocated to land use categories based on the allocation
 categories identified in the Zoning Code: (1) residential; (2) commercial; (3) governmental; and (4) City-
 administered community reserve. The Housing Plan includes Program 3.1 to require a portion of any
 new water sources to be set aside specifically for projects that include development of affordable units.
 The City will continue to work with regional agencies to ensure that sufficient infrastructure support for
 water and other resources may become available to accommodate planned growth in the future.
 2.     Wastewater
 The City’s wastewater disposal system includes seven pump stations, 56 miles of gravity sewers, and
 two miles of pressure sewers, which pump wastewater into the regional lines that transport wastewater
 to the Monterey Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant in Marina. The wastewater treatment plant is
 operated by the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (MRWPCA). The wastewater
 treatment plant has a design capacity of 29.6 million gallons per day (mgd). The average daily flow of
 the wastewater treatment plant in 2013 was 19.2 mgd. Current flow is less than that of 1989, despite
 substantial growth in the MRWPCA service area. The average daily flow of the projected housing need
 (RHNA) is well within the capacity of the wastewater treatment system during the 2015-2023 planning
 period.
 6.4 Energy Conservation
 Planning to maximize energy efficiency and the incorporation of energy conservation and green
 building features, contributes to reduced housing costs. Energy efficient design for sustainable
 communities reduces dependence on automobiles. Additionally, maximizing energy efficiency reduces
 greenhouse gas emissions. In response to recent legislation on global climate change, local governments
 are required to implement measures that cut greenhouse gas emissions attributable to land use decisions
 (see discussion on Global Climate Change below). The Housing Element programs can support energy
 efficiency that benefits the market and the environment by:
      •   Establishing a more compact urban core, bringing residents close to work and services,
          therefore reducing automobile trips and reducing emissions;
      •   Implementing passive solar construction techniques that require solar orientation, thermal
          massing, and other energy efficient design standards; and
      •   Encouraging the use of solar water heating and photovoltaics.
 Residential water heating and air heating/cooling are major sources of energy consumption. With the
 application of energy efficient design and the use of solar power systems, home heating and cooling can
 be operated on a more efficient and sustainable level. To encourage energy efficient design, the City
 adopted a Green Building Ordinance in 2010. The Ordinance required that applicants for all new
 residential developments and significant remodels must accrue a specified number of points on the
 City’s Green Building checklist in order to qualify for a Building Permit. The checklist specified a
 number of energy saving building techniques such as energy heels on roof trusses, hot water pipe

 insulation, and high efficiency fixtures, heating and cooling systems. The Green Building Ordinance
 was superseded by the 2012 CalGreen Building Code.
 The City has the added opportunity to implement solar technologies with the help of recent legislation.
 The Solar Water Heating and Efficiency Act of 2007 (AB 1470) has created a $250 million, ten-year
 program to provide consumer rebates for solar water heating systems.
 Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides a variety of energy conservation services for residents and
 several other energy assistance programs for lower income households. These programs include the
 Energy Watch Partnerships and the Charitable Contributions Program. The Energy Watch Partnerships
 help residents lower their energy bills and promote cleaner energy production. Through Energy Watch
 Partnerships PG&E has extended the reach of effectiveness of energy efficiency programs and
 provided information about demand responses programs, renewable energy, and self-generations
 opportunities.
 The Charitable Contributions Program gives millions of dollars each year to non-profit organizations to
 support environmental and energy sustainability. Projects that are funded include residential and
 community solar energy distribution projects, public education projects, and energy efficiency
 programs. The goal is to ensure that 75% of the dollars assist underserved communities, which includes
 low-income households, people with disabilities, and seniors.
 PG&E also offers rebates for energy efficient home appliances and remodeling. Residents can apply for
 a variety of rebates that make it more affordable in the short term to save energy and money in the long
 term. Rebates are available for cooling and heating equipment, lighting, seasonal appliances, and
 remodeling (cool roofs, insulation, water heaters). These opportunities are available to all income levels
 and housing types.
 Through these and other conservation measures, the City seeks to help minimize the percentage of
 household income required for energy costs as well as minimize the production of greenhouse gases.
 Programs have been included to incorporate newly adopted state energy efficiency standards and to
 encourage energy efficient technologies.

tsunamis, although tsunamis also have been triggered
by submarine landslides and volcanic eruptions.
Tsunamis are actually a series of very long-period
waves (lasting five minutes to several hours) that are
low in height when traversing water of oceanic depth.
But when tsunami waves approach shore where the
water depth decreases rapidly, wave refraction,
shoaling, and bay or harbor resonance may result in
dramatically increased wave heights.
Most tsunamis that have struck the California coast in
the past⎯such as the 1964 Crescent City disaster⎯
have resulted from very distant earthquakes, primarily
in the Aleutian Islands. Because of flooding and wave
action, the tsunami hazard associated with large
distant earthquakes appears to be high along beaches
and within harbor facilities.
The major California offshore faults close to Monterey
Bay are probably strike-slip faults, and earthquakes
generated on strike-slip faults are not likely to produce
large-scale tsunamis. Thus, tsunami potential asso-
ciated with a local offshore seismic event is low.
Nevertheless, tsunamis have occurred within the
Monterey Bay region, resulting in significant damage
to harbors and other coastal facilities. There is no
record of any tsunamis more than 10 feet high
occurring along the Monterey County Coast. The
effect of a tsunami wave on the Pacific Grove shore-
line would be comparable to a swiftly rising and falling
tide. For the Pacific Grove shoreline, the main safety
hazard from a tsunami is the possibility that residents
on Ocean View Boulevard and other low altitude
streets such as Coral Street and Acropolis Street who
are not evacuated may be caught by the waves. There
is also the possibility that sight-seers who evade police
tsunami warning barriers and follow the tsunami
drawdown into the exposed intertidal areas may be
swept away by the following crest of the tsunami as
were 61 sightseers in Hilo, Hawaii, in 1960.
A tsunami warning system has been set up with the
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, and the
Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska. These
Centers will provide warnings to the National
Weather Service which will pass them on to the
Pacific Grove Police Department.
Areas above the seacliff in Pacific Grove are consid-
ered to have a low tsunami hazard, while beaches and
areas below the seacliff are considered to have a high
tsunami hazard.

quiet periods may lure the unwary too close to the

unexpected large waves pose by posting warning signs
along the shoreline.
A study of storm damage in the vicinity of Monterey
Harbor from 1910 to 1960 indicates periodic damage
to harbor structures and moored boats, but little loss
of life. The winter storms of 1982-83 downed trees,
damaged piers and some seawalls, and flooded part of
the Asilomar area. Although recreational use of the
shoreline has intensified substantially since 1970, the
heaviest use is during the summer months when storm
activity is rare. (Most storms occur between October
and April.)

Total criminal offenses reported in Pacific Grove
declined from 967 in 1992 to 921 in 1993, a decrease of
5 percent. For the same period, crimes against people
increased 14.6 percent, from 121 in 1992 to 140 in
1993. Crimes against property increased from 635
reports in 1992 to 654 in 1993. Citations for moving
violations increased 14.2 percent, from 3,004 in 1992 to
3,498 in 1993. Parking citations decreased, from 20,763
in 1992 to 13,836 in 1993, a drop of 33.37 percent.
