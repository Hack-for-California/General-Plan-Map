1 Introduction
Introduction to the General Plan
Westminster, like many of the suburban communities that resulted from             In This Chapter…
growth of the Los Angeles metropolitan area in the late 1950s, and unlike
many newer master planned communities, has evolved into a unique city that        »   Introduction to the
transitioned from an historic agricultural settlement to a vibrant, diverse,          General Plan
independently-minded, entrepreneurial hub with its own eclectic mix.              »   Our History
Established residential neighborhoods, iconic Old English architecture in the     »   Community Vision
Civic Center district, thriving small businesses and restaurants of the           »   Purpose of the General Plan
renowned Little Saigon district, Westminster Mall, and its location in Orange     »   How to Read the General
County are all important identities of Westminster. More importantly, for the         Plan
people of Westminster, the community is defined by its rich history rooted in     »   Related Plans, Programs,
multiculturalism, the opportunity for economic prosperity, and its reputation         and Legislation
as a family-friendly place to live and work. With major freeways and highway
transportation corridors traversing the city, Westminster is easily accessible to
the region’s entertainment, recreation, shopping, education, cultural and
employment centers, as well as harbors, airports and rail, while enjoying the
pleasant Mediterranean climate of Southern California’s coastal region.
The City’s first General Plan was adopted in 1965 and has been updated two
times prior (1985 and 1996) to the current effort. The City’s 2016 General Plan
Update takes a fresh look at where Westminster is today and where it’s going.
Through a robust dialogue with the Westminster community, including its
residents, business and property owners, and visitors, the City Council
adopted the City’s first long-term Vision Statement (described in detail later in
this chapter). This Vision Statement is not only the foundation for the City’s
Updated General Plan, but for all long-term decision-making in the City. The
Vision Statement memorializes the community’s aspirations and describes
the “Westminster of the future” as having:
»    A special sense and quality of place;
»    A strong community culture;
»    A diversity of residential neighborhoods and housing choices;
»    A thriving economy;
»    A desirable location where people can get around easily;
»    Ample park facilities and recreation opportunities.

                                              This introductory chapter provides a broad overview of the Westminster
                                              General Plan—how it was created, how it should be used, and what it sets out
                                              to achieve. It also includes background information relevant to the plan, such
                                              as an overview of the General Plan content, its relationship to relevant local,
                                              state, and federal programs and legislation, a brief historical discussion, and
                                              Westminster’s Vision Statement. The purpose of this General Plan Update is to
                                              comprehensively modernize the 1996 plan to reflect current conditions,
                                              establish a common vision of what the community aspires to become, and

                                              evident in modern-day Westminster. Over the years, Westminster grew from
                                              an agrarian community to one with a diversity of land use, including a range
                                              of residential neighborhoods, job choices, and recreational amenities. A brief
                                              overview of the community’s history is outlined in this section to provide the
                                              framework for moving forward over the next 20-30 years.
                                              Agrarian Roots: 1800s – 1920s
                                              Westminster’s roots date back to the 1800s, when it was founded by
                                              Reverend Lemuel P. Webber as the second Presbyterian temperance colony in
                                              Orange County (after Anaheim). The colony was named after the Westminster
                                              Assembly of 1643, which prescribed the basic principles of the Presbyterian
                                              faith. The economy was established throughout the 19th century, when the
                                              completion of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads brought settlers
                                              from the east coast, along with immigrants from China, Japan, and Mexico.
                                              Many people were attracted to the region’s rich productive soils, and the area
                                              was eventually transformed from a “small quiet village” into an agricultural
                                              hub with some of the most productive dairying centers, celery fields, and
                                              sugar factories in the country. However, even with growing interest in the
                                              region, the population of Westminster was only 225 people by 1874.
                                              During the late 1800s and early 1900s, the town’s business economy started
                                              to take shape. The town’s first general store and schoolhouse were
                                              established to serve the growing community; the general store kicked-off

 Westminster’s first business district on Almond Avenue, which today is known
 as Westminster Boulevard. By the end of the 19th century, the town had a
 range of commercial services while maintaining its reputation as a premiere
 agricultural center. The first library was built in 1900 and in 1902 the first
 telephone line reached what would become the City of Westminster. To
 support the community’s growing economic interests, the town’s Chamber of
 Commerce was established and the “Plaza Association” was organized to
 develop Sigler Park, which still serves as a signature landmark and local
 destination in Westminster.
 A Growing Community: 1920s – 1950s
 The suburban residential tracts developed in Westminster in the 1920s-1950s
 are still a prominent fixture of the community’s urban fabric as the majority of
 the City’s acres support residential uses. In 1924 the Midway City subdivision
 began construction, followed shortly by Barber City in 1927. During the 1920s,
 the world’s largest goldfish farm moved into the area where the Westminster
 Mall stands today. Despite the growth of the community in the 1920s, the
 Great Depression stifled growth for much of the 1930s. In addition to the
 economic strains of the Depression, natural disasters including a major
 earthquake in 1933 and a severe flood in 1938 held Westminster back from
 embracing the development the city experienced in its early years.
 Despite its stagnant growth in the early 1900s, by the 1940s and 1950s, the
 nationwide war and post-war boom brought exponential population growth
 to most areas throughout Southern California, especially those communities
 with access to jobs near the ports and aeronautic facilities. Following the war,
 servicemen who were located in Southern California decided to stay for the
 warm climate, and many large housing tracts grew around the agricultural
 lands of Westminster. The City’s population nearly quadrupled during this
 time from 2,500 in 1942 to nearly 10,800 in 1956.
 In 1957, proceedings began to form a municipality called Tri City, in a
 proposal to combine three communities into one: Westminster, Barber City,
 and Midway City. Before the vote, Midway City withdrew from the venture
 and remains unincorporated today. The proposal to incorporate Westminster
 and Barber City was approved by a vote of 1,096 to 1,008, and Westminster
 became California’s 337th city in 1957.
Midway City’s residential tracts were largely built during the first half of the 1900s; while
the majority of Westminster incorporated in 1957, Midway City continues to remain an
unincorporated area of Orange County. These neighborhoods have some of the most
mature landscaping in the community, as exemplified by the iconic tree pictured above.

                                                    A Landmark Case: Mendez v. Westminster, 1947
                                                    Even as Westminster (and the rest of Orange County) was growing rapidly
                                                    in the post-WWII era, most recreational activities and public places
                                                    remained segregated—including public parks, movie theaters, and
                                                    schools. In Orange County, Mexican and Mexican-American school
                                                    enrollment was restricted to separate schoolhouses, a policy which
                                                    affected approximately 5,000 children of “Mexican” ancestry. In 1945, five
                                                    Mexican-American fathers, led by Mr. Gonzalo Mendez, brought suit in
                                                    the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles against the Westminster School
                                                    District of Orange County with the claim that children of “Mexican”
                                                    ancestry were victims of unconstitutional discrimination by being forced
                                                    to attend separate schools in the Westminster, Garden Grove, Santa Ana,
                                                    and El Modena school districts of Orange County.
                                                    In 1946, the Los Angeles court ruled in favor of Mr. Mendez. The ruling was
                                                    upheld on appeal to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco,
                                                    and was upheld again in 1947 by the United States Court of Appeals for
                                                    the Ninth Circuit. Two months later, California's Governor Earl Warren
                                                    signed a bill ending school segregation in California, making it the first
                                                    state to officially desegregate its public schools, thanks—in large part—to
                                                    the activism and social consciousness demonstrated by Mr. Mendez.
                                                    Mendez was the first ruling in the United States in favor of desegregation.
                                                    In Mendez, Thurgood Marshall represented Sylvia Mendez and Linda
                                                    Brown. Marshall used some of the same arguments from Mendez to win
                                                    Brown v. Board of Education eight years later. The Supreme Court adopted
                                                    many of Marshall's arguments and, in 1954, issued an opinion ending
                                                    school segregation throughout the United States.
                                                    The historic importance of Mendez has been celebrated and
                                                    commemorated in a variety of ways at the local and national level. In
                                                    particular, in 2007, on the 60th anniversary of the case, the United States
                                                    Postal Service honored the ruling with a commemorative stamp, which
                                                    was presented to the Mendez family at a press conference at the Rose
                                                    Center Theater in Westminster. In 2011, President Barack Obama awarded
                                                    the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Sylvia Mendez, the daughter of
                                                    Gonzalo Mendez (lead plaintiff in the lawsuit). Sylvia was one of the
                                                    Mexican-American students denied admission to their local school, and
                                                    since that time has worked tirelessly to encourage students to stay in
                                                    school.

Becoming a City: 1960s – 1970s
By 1963, the Orange County population had surpassed one million, as
tourism, manufacturing and the service industries took over local economies
once Disneyland opened its gates in 1955. During the 1960s, Westminster’s
population exploded, more than doubling in a single decade from 25,000 at
the beginning of the 1960s to 60,000 by 1970. As a result, the majority of the
City’s residential neighborhoods were built during this time. Westminster
continued to thrive throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially after the
Southland Freeway (I-405) system was completed and the Westminster Mall
was constructed, the latter of which became a regional attraction that
continues to be the City’s primary sales tax generator. As commerce and
tourism continued to develop throughout the city and county, municipal
construction projects in Westminster—including a new administration
building, senior citizens facility, fire department buildings, and a renovation of
the civic auditorium—demonstrated the prosperity of the time. By the end of
the 1970s, very little vacant land remained in Westminster, and some of the
community’s older buildings had already reached the end of their useful life
and were redeveloped.
Creation of a Cultural Destination: 1970s – 1980s
In the 1970s and 1980s a large number of Vietnamese refugees fleeing from
conflict in their homeland settled in an area of Westminster and Garden Grove
referred to as “Little Saigon.” This influx of new immigrants spurred the
construction and development of a variety of Southeast Asian businesses,
restaurants, and professional services, which establish a new commercial
activity center in the city and supported the largest Vietnamese cultural
enclave outside of Vietnam (some 500 businesses opened in the Bolsa
Avenue area in the 1980s alone). Although several other Vietnamese enclaves
have emerged throughout the United States (including in San Jose, Houston,
and Chicago) Little Saigon here in the Westminster/Garden Grove area is
unofficially considered the Vietnamese “capital” of the United States, with a
2010 population of 36,000 Vietnamese Americans (the highest municipal
concentration of Vietnamese Americans in the nation). On weekends, the
number of people in Westminster triples, as Little Saigon regularly draws
visitors from Los Angeles, San Diego, and even northern California.
                                                                                   Little Saigon in Westminster is a

     Westminster Today: 1990s – Present Day
     Well-established by the 1990s as a multicultural community with deep roots in
     Western, Mexican, and Vietnamese histories, in 1996 Westminster was
     designated an “All-America City” by the National Civic League for civic
     accomplishments, made possible by the cooperative efforts of business,
     government, the volunteer sector, and other individuals. Westminster continues
     to support the needs of a diverse population today and is widely seen as a
     welcoming community, with many services and venues to serve its visitors and
     residents including a 400-seat theater at the Westminster Rose Center, a satellite
     campus of Coastline Community College, Sid Goldstein Freedom Park, and
     Westminster Mall.
     Upgrades to the City’s infrastructure continue, with the City continually investing
     in multimodal transportation, water services, waste operations, parks and
     recreation facilities, public administration offices, and public safety services. In
     the first part of the 2000s, there has been a special focus on improving and
     maintaining maintenance of those facilities most important to a primarily built-
     out city, including the community’s roadways, utilities, and parks. Westminster
     demonstrates its commitment to continue providing a high quality of life for its
     residents, property owners, business owners, and visitors.
     Demographic Overview (2014)
     Like any other community, Westminster is ever changing and growing and its
     demographics shift from year to year. With that said, this section presents a
     brief overview of Westminster as it looked when this General Plan was
     prepared. It provides a framework for understanding the City, its attributes,
     and relevant issues in planning its future
       Westminster’s population
       has tripled since 1960.
       Source: U.S. Census, 2014.
     Westminster has the 10th largest population out of 34 cities in Orange
     County, with 91,652 residents in 2014. From 1960 to 2014, Westminster’s
     population grew significantly compared to the preceding 50 years. Much of
     that growth occurred between 1960 and 2000, with only a 2 percent increase
     during the past 15 years. The age distribution in Westminster has experienced
     greater variability over time compared to Orange County, evidenced by the
     significant percentage of “baby boomers” (people born between the mid-
     1940s and mid-1960s) and their children, known as the “echo boom” (people
     born between the early 1980s and early 2000s). As of 2012, Westminster had a
     higher population of residents who are 65 and older. In essence, it is a much
     older community than its neighbors. Over the next 20 years, as the older
     generation downsizes from larger houses to smaller, more manageable
     homes, the housing needs of Westminster’s residents may change.
     Additionally, there will be an increase in demand for medical care, health care
     facilities, specialized recreation programs, and comparable services
1-6 City of Westminster General Plan | Introduction

Westminster is a culturally diverse community—in 2012, nearly 75 percent of
residents identified themselves as something other than White (non-
Hispanic). Almost half of Westminster’s residents identify as Asian. Both
Westminster and its neighbors have approximately equal percentages of
residents who identify as White (non-Hispanic), but Westminster’s neighbors
have a much larger proportion of residents who identify as Hispanic (23
percent in Westminster, 44 percent in the region). Reflecting its diverse
cultural identity, Westminster has a significant proportion of foreign-born
residents—approximately 45 percent of residents were born outside of the
US based on 2012 numbers. Nearly 40 percent of Westminster residents speak
Vietnamese at home; of these, about two-thirds report that they do not speak
English very well. Westminster has a much larger population who are 14 years
or older and not proficient in English than its neighbors. Westminster’s
diverse population base suggests a multicultural future for the City that is
enriched by varied ethnic and racial communities and traditions.
Tomorrow’s Westminster: A Vision Statement
Looking forward to the next 20-30 years, as part of the General Plan Update
                                                                              Source: U.S. Census, 2012.
the citizens of Westminster and City Council crafted a Vision Statement that
reflects the set of shared values and priorities that are most important to
the community. The various components of the Vision serve as the
foundation for the goals, policies and, programs developed for each of the
General Plan elements. Westminster’s short-term and long-range decisions
by policymakers will be evaluated by their ability to further the aspirations
of the community as outlined in this plan as they work to improve the
quality of life and economic vitality in Westminster. The Community Vision
Statement is presented on the following page.

1-8 City of Westminster General Plan | Introductio
Purpose of the General Plan
The Westminster General Plan is a comprehensive, long-range planning and
policy document that will not only guide growth and change within the
community, but also preserve and protect the unique qualities that the
Westminster community values most. The General Plan is the single most
important tool used to help successful communities achieve their vision. A
General Plan:
»    Sets the course for decision making;
»    Helps to balance the interests of residents with the needs of business
     owners and property owners;
»    Helps to inform and educate the citizenry;
»    Serves as an effective management tool for City staff;
»    Provides guidance for economic decisions;
»    Ensures the protection of the natural environment.
This update process is not intended to craft the General Plan from scratch;
instead it streamlines and further refines the existing direction already
established by the City in the 1996 General Plan. Proposals for development,
either developer- or City-initiated, must be analyzed and tested for
consistency with the goals, policies, and programs in every applicable
element of the General Plan. This test of compliance is also a required
criterion for determining significant impacts under the provisions of the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has been prepared as a companion
document to the General Plan. The EIR assesses the potential impacts that are
generated by the goals and policies of the General Plan, and identifies
mitigation measures to address those impacts. The associated technical
studies prepared for traffic, infrastructure, and cultural resources provided the
technical detail used to determine the level of impacts that could be created
by the General Plan.
State Law requires each General Plan to be:
1.   Comprehensive. General Plans must address a wide range of issues
     associated with city’s physical development and social environment, as
     well as address both the territory within the boundaries of the City, and
     areas outside of its boundaries that relate and influence its planning
     vision and activities related to community growth and development,
     known as the city’s Sphere of Influence (see the land use element).
2.   Internally consistent. All of the Plan’s goals, policies, text, maps, tables,
     figures, etc. cannot conflict with the element in which it appears, or with
     those of another element. For instance, if land use element policies are
     likely to result in an increase in population and traffic, the mobility
     element must provide feasible mitigation to address those impacts. All
     elements of the General Plan, including adopted optional elements, have
     equal legal status, so no element takes legal priority over another.
3.   Long-term in nature. The General Plan must take a long-term
     perspective, which is usually at least 20 years into the future. Since the
     General Plan will influence the well-being of both current and future
     generations, it will need to project future needs and conditions to the
     best of its ability, in order to better establish goals and objectives.
                                 City of Westminster General Plan | Introduction   1-9

                                        All General Plans are required by State law to cover seven topics: land use,
                                        circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise, and safety. However,
                                        state law also provides local jurisdictions the flexibility to determine the
                                        structure of their General Plans, and to include optional elements. For
   Who Will Use the                     instance, a city or county may combine one or more elements or structure the
   General Plan?                        General Plan by issue, so long as the topics of the mandatory elements are
   Using the Vision Statement as a      addressed. Because the Westminster community vision articulates a desire for
   foundation for decision-making,      a strong community culture, a special sense and quality of place, and a
   city councils, commissions, and      thriving economy, the city has also elected to include two optional elements:
   staff, along with members of the     Economic Development and Community Design. The Westminster General
   community and other agencies         Plan has combined and organized the topics as outlined below.

                                       can accommodate mandated housing requirements. State law requires that
                                       this element be revised, at a minimum, every eight years.
1-10                                   City of Westminster General Plan | Introduction

How to Read Westminster’s General Plan
As the guide for future development and desired conditions, residents,
property owners, and business owners should also familiarize themselves
with how to read this document. Each element contains a brief introduction,
several goals and related policies, and a description of related plans,
programs and legislation.
Goals
A goal in the General Plan is the broadest statement of community values. It is
a generalized ideal which provides a sense of direction for action. They are
overall statements of desired future conditions. For example: “A safe,
aesthetically pleasing, and unified community appearance within the context
of distinct districts and neighborhoods.”
Policies
The essence of the General Plan is contained within its policies. Policies are
statements which further refine the goals, and guide the course of action the
City must take to achieve the goals in the plan. It is important to note that
policies are guides for decision makers, not decisions themselves. For example:
“Use public landscaping and signage along streets, sidewalks, and property
frontages and in public spaces to strengthen the existing City identity.”
Policies must be clear to be useful. However, they may range in terms of
commitment of resources, importance and/or urgency, and expected results.
Therefore, it is important for readers to understand the distinctions between
various levels of policy. The following is a list of common terms used in           Implementation
policies, and how to interpret their usage in the policy language. In cases         Actions
where other action terms are used (and not defined below), an equivalent to
                                                                                    Details for implementing
the closest applicable term can be used.

                                 City of Westminster General Plan | Introduction                                   1-11

      Amending the General Plan
      The General Plan is not static, but rather is a dynamic and multi-faceted
      document that defines and addresses the changing needs of the City. It is
      based on an on-going assessment and understanding of existing and
      projected community needs. To assure that the General Plan is kept current,
      short-term programs and policies may be reviewed periodically to reflect
      compatibility with budgetary priorities and related program status. Long-
      term programs and implementation measures must also be given
      consideration to assure timely funding and development of critical
      infrastructure and public services and facilities.
      Timing
      Mandatory elements of the General Plan may be amended up to four times in
      each calendar year. The City Council or any citizen may initiate a General Plan
      Amendment. It is left to the discretion of the local jurisdiction to establish an
      amendment schedule to be published one year in advance. State law further
      requires that the Housing Element be reviewed and updated at least once
      every eight years.
      Application Procedures
      Applications for the amendment of the General Plan and the appropriate fees
      are filed with the City of Westminster Planning Division. An amendment to
      the General Plan constitutes a project under the California Environmental
      Quality Act (CEQA) and, therefore, is evaluated for its environmental effects
      and consistency with other elements of the General Plan. Final approval of
      General Plan amendments is the responsibility of the City Council subject to
      satisfying the environmental requirements imposed by CEQA.
      Exemptions
      The State Legislature has recognized that occasions arise which require the
      local jurisdiction to have some flexibility in amending the General Plan. As set
      forth in the California Government Code, the following are exempt from the
      General Plan amendment schedule:
      »    Amendments to optional elements.
      »    Amendments requested and necessary for affordable housing (Section
           65358(c)).
      »    Any amendment necessary to comply with a court decision in a case
           involving the legal adequacy of the general plan (Section 65358(d)(1)).
      »    Amendments to bring a general plan into compliance with an airport
           land use plan (Section 65302.3).
1-12 City of Westminster General Plan | Introduction

Associated Documents and Agencies
Although the General Plan serves as the primary means to help the City
implement its vision, several other management and implementation tools
are needed to ensure that the goals and policies identified here are fully
realized.
City Documents
In addition to internal consistency, the General Plan must be consistent with
other planning tools, such as the zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance,
and specific plans. If those documents are determined to be inconsistent with
the General Plan, they cannot be approved. On a regular basis, the General
Plan should also be reviewed by other departments to determine whether or
not efforts such as public works projects or public land acquisition or sale are
consistent with the goals and policies identified in the General Plan. The
following are some management and implementation tools that are needed
to ensure that the goals and policies identified are fully realized.
Westminster Municipal Code
The Westminster Municipal Code regulates most aspects of city operations.
While all of its 17 titles are important to maintaining law and order in the City,
some are more closely associated with the General Plan, including:
»    Title 5, Business Taxes, Licenses and Regulations
»    Title 8, Healthy and Safety
»    Title 10, Vehicles and Traffic
»    Title 12, Streets, Sidewalks and Public Places
»    Title 16, Subdivisions
»    Title 17, Land Use
Title 17, Land Use—the City’s Zoning Code—is the primary tool used to
implement the General Plan, and regulates the type and intensity of
development citywide. The Zoning Code establishes basic regulations
applicable to each zone and land use to ensure an appropriate distribution of
land uses, and orderly development of the City. Included in the code are
development regulations which define limits on building height, setbacks,
and landscaping.
Specific Plans
Specific Plans are detailed plans for the development of a particular
geographic area within a City. Similarly to the Zoning Code, it contains
detailed development standards, distribution of land uses, infrastructure
requirements, and implementation measures for the orderly development of
the City. Specific Plans can provide greater flexibility and an opportunity to
focus regulations and standards on the goals of the particular area. In 2011,
the City of Westminster adopted the Moran Street Specific Plan for
approximately 20 acres of land on the south side of Bolsa Avenue between
Magnolia and Brookhurst, in the heart of Little Saigon (including Asian Garden
Mall). The General Plan Update does not impact the Moran Street Specific
Plan, which continues to act as the development plan for the project area.
                                 City of Westminster General Plan | Introduction   1-13

      Capital Improvement Plan (CIP)
      A Capital Improvement Plan is a community planning and fiscal management
      tool that assesses and coordinates the location, timing, and financing of
      capital improvements over a short time period, usually 4-6 years. The City of
      Westminster regularly reviews its Capital Improvement Plan to ensure the City
      is dedicating the necessary resources where they are most needed.
      Plans, Programs, and Legislation
      A number of key state and federal legislative mandates influence the content
      of the General Plan’s and must also be addressed, including legislation related
      to climate change, transportation, housing, and public safety issues as
      follows:
      Orange County General Plan
      The Orange County General Plan guides land use decisions within the
      unincorporated areas of Orange County. According to the Orange County
      General Plan Land Use Plan (2014) the county islands included within
      Westminster’s Sphere of Influence are designated a combination of suburban
      residential (0.5-18 du/ac), urban residential (18+ du/ac), and community
      commercial uses.
      County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways
      The County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH) forms part of
      the Orange County General Plan and designates the arterial system in the
      Circulation & Mobility Element of the General Plan. Defined according to
      specific arterial functional classifications, the MPAH serves to define the
      intended future roadway system for the County. Cities within the County are
      expected to achieve consistency with the MPAH in individual General Plan
      circulation elements. To implement changes to the MPAH, approval from the
      Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) is required.
      Measure M
      Measure M (1990) authorized a half-cent retail sales tax increase for the
      duration of 20 years throughout Orange County to generate revenue to use
      on local and regional transportation improvements and maintenance
      projects. Although Measure M expired in 2011, a November 2006 ballot
      measure renewed the program (now known as M2) through 2031. M2
      extends the requirements of Measure M, without increasing sales taxes, to
      fund freeway, street, transit, and environmental projects identified in a
      Transportation Investment Plan considered by voters in tandem with the
      renewal measure.
      Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
      Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and Sustainable
      Communities Strategy (SCS)
      The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is a long-range transportation plan
      developed and updated by SCAG every four years. The RTP identifies regional
      transportation strategies to address regional mobility needs using growth
      forecasts and economic projections over a 20-year period. The Sustainable
      Communities Strategy (SCS) is a newly required element of the RTP which
      integrates land use and transportation strategies to achieve California Air
      Resources Board (CARB) emissions reduction targets. In 2012, the Regional
1-14 City of Westminster General Plan | Introduction

Council of SCAG adopted the 2012-2035 RTP/SCS: Towards a Sustainable
Future. The 2012–2035 RTP/SCS provides a blueprint for improving quality of
life for Southern California residents by providing more choices for where
they will live, work, and play, and how they will move around.
Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP)
The Air Quality Management Plan (1994) was prepared by the Southern
California Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and is updated every
three years. It contains policies and measures that help to achieve federal and
state air quality standards across the South Coast Air Basin.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the state
legislature as an instrument for ensuring that environmental impacts of local
development projects are appropriately assessed and mitigated where
feasible. The main purpose of CEQA is to disclose to the public the significant
environmental effects of a proposed discretionary project. The provisions of
the law and environmental review procedure can be found in the CEQA
Statutes and Guidelines.
Assembly Bill 32
Assembly Bill (AB) 32, The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006,
sets a statewide goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) to 1990
levels by 2020 (a 15% reduction from a “business-as-usual” scenario). In May
2014, the California Air Resources Board (ARB) approved first update to the
Climate Change Scoping Plan, which defines primary strategies to achieve the
most technologically feasible and cost-effective GHG emission reductions.
Based on the State Attorney General’s interpretation of AB 32, local GHG
reduction targets and strategies must be addressed by the General Plan.
Senate Bill 97
Senate Bill 97 (2007) acknowledges that climate change is a prominent
environmental issue that requires analysis under the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA).
Complete Streets Act of 2008
The Complete Streets Act (2008) revised requirements for general plan
circulation elements to plan for a more balanced multimodal transportation
network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways,
which includes bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities, motorists, movers
of commercial goods, pedestrians, users of public transportation, and seniors.
The Complete Streets Act is intended to help fulfill the State’s commitment to
reduce GHG emissions through innovative ways to reduce vehicle miles
traveled (VMT) and shifting from short trips in the automobile to biking,
walking, and using public transit.
Senate Bill 812
Senate Bill 812 (2010) requires that housing elements of general plans include
an evaluation of the special housing needs of persons with disabilities,
including developmental disabilities. The full analysis should include an
estimate of the number of persons within a jurisdiction with developmental
disabilities, an assessment of the housing need, and a discussion of potential
resources.
                                City of Westminster General Plan | Introduction   1-15

      Executive Order S-3-05
      Executive Order S-3-05 aligns regional transportation planning efforts,
      regional GHG reduction targets, and affordable housing allocations. In
      compliance, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) has
      adopted a Sustainable Communities Strategy, which allocates land uses in its
      Regional Plan. These allocations are considered in drafting the General Plan’s
      Land Use and Housing Elements.
      Agencies
      Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo)
      The Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) is a
      government agency that is responsible for overseeing the formation and
      development of local government agencies within Orange County. LAFCo’s
      regulatory authority is to review proposals to annex land to cities or special
      districts, and their planning authority is to determine and update each city’s
      sphere of influence (SOI).
      An SOI is a local jurisdiction’s plan for the probable physical boundaries and

Visioning Process and Community
Participation
General Plan preparation is a comprehensive process requiring active
participation by City leaders and staff, residents, community groups, and
businesses. Preparing a General Plan requires a jurisdiction to conduct a
candid assessment of existing conditions and trends, opportunities and
constraints, and vision for the future. The input generated by residents and
stakeholders informs the General Plan so that it reflects real-world issues
experienced by those who live and work in the community. Before the
General Plan can be considered by the Planning Commission and City Council
for action, various community members, stakeholders, and members of the
business community must become involved and volunteer their expertise
and insights to help shape the General Plan.                                         The General Plan Advisory Committee
                                                                                     members met 10 times over the

to as wide an audience as possible. The City used a variety of creative
methods (in three languages) to reach the community, including
advertisements at 100 bus stops, flyers at local businesses, direct mailers to
every business owner, property owner, and tenant in the City (32,000
mailings), and advertisements in three local newspapers (in addition to the
project website, open town hall, and other meeting-specific advertisements
undertaken for the project).
In August of 2014 the Westminster City Council appointed a 21-member
General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC). The GPAC was comprised of two
City Council Members, representatives from each of the City’s various
commissions and committees and residents, business owners, and property
owners appointed by Council to represent the community’s interests. The
GPAC met 10 times to provide direction and feedback on the General Plan
Update, including a bus tour around Orange County where they were able to
see examples of different projects in the region that might represent the
community’s vision for Westminster. The GPAC played a critical role in
shaping the General Plan and the City recognized them for their service at a
regular meeting of the City Council following adoption of the General Plan in
fall 2016.
                                                                                     Invitations to get involved in the

 A 21-member General Plan Advisory Committee was appointed by the City Council to
 provide direction and guidance on development of the General Plan. This is the GPAC
 taking their Oath of Office.

                                            A dedicated website for the General Plan Update was managed for the entire
                                            duration of the project. The website was the go-to location for community
                                            members, City staff, and other interested agencies to receive up-to-date
                                            information on opportunities for input, upcoming activities, background
                                            information, and special topic areas, including land planning and
                                            environmental review. The website received over 15,000 individual hits from
                                            Spring 2014 – Fall 2016.
                                            The City also hosted a number of community open houses on the Vision

                                            Report. These meetings were well attended and the feedback received was
                                            provided to the GPAC and the Planning Commission and City Council for their
                                            review and consideration throughout the process. Overall, at these open
                                            house-style meetings the community felt strongly about elevating the image
                                            and aesthetics of the commercial areas and streets, improving the retail,
                                            dining, and entertainment options throughout the City, updating and

Introduction to Land Use
Land uses in Westminster are characterized as a diverse collection of               In This Element…

how to accommodate land uses to respond to the community’s changing
needs, all without compromising the integrity of the uses and experiences the
community values the most and would like to preserve.
The quality of life for residents of Westminster—and for people who visit—is
shaped by the types and mix of uses that:
»    Contribute to or create a sense of place and well-being
»    Are flexible enough to respond quickly to market conditions and trends
»    Respect and sustain natural resources
»    Support the City’s fiscal sustainability
»    Reflect the City’s diversity and entrepreneurial spirit
»    Recognize the community’s culture and history

The Land Use element combines two state-mandated General Plan
Elements—the Land Use Element and the Noise Element. California
Government Code Section 65302(a) stipulates that a general plan designate
the proposed general distribution, general location, and extent of the uses of
the land for housing, commerce, industry, open space, education, and public
facilities. It further requires that the land use element include a statement of
the standards of population density and building intensity. The Noise Element
is required by state law to “identify and appraise noise problems in the
community,” and noise contours shown in the element are “used as a guide
…for minimizing the exposure of community residents to excessive noise.”
(California Government Code [CGC § 65302 [f]).

The City of Westminster’s sphere of influence was adopted in 1973 by the
Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo), the agency
responsible for establishing the spheres of influence for incorporated cities in
Orange County. Westminster’s planning area includes the City’s sphere of
influence and all properties within the City limits of Westminster and the four
Orange County island areas that comprise Midway City, including
Beach/McFadden, Bolsa/Midway, Bolsa/Pacific, and McFadden/ Monroe. LAFCo
encourages jurisdictions to consider annexing unincorporated communities
within their sphere of influence. However, at the time of General Plan adoption,
the City of Westminster has no plans to pursue annexation of its
unincorporated communities (but the opportunity may be reevaluated in the
future).
Per Senate Bill 244 (described at the end of this element), cities are
responsible for considering the needs of disadvantaged communities within
their sphere of influence. A disadvantaged community is an unincorporated
county island in which the median household income is 80 percent or less of
the statewide median household income, based on the most recent US
decennial census. At the time of General Plan adoption, two county islands in
Westminster (Beach/McFadden and Bolsa/Pacific) and approximately half of
the Bolsa/Midway county island are considered disadvantaged communities.
Westminster’s General Plan identifies ways to ensure that these communities
are provided the land use direction and infrastructure services they need to
continue to be safe and secure communities.
Managing Future Growth
As described in the Introduction, Westminster’s development history dates
back to the 1800s when it was established as Orange County’s second colony.
Like many communities in Southern California, Westminster experienced
periods of rapid growth in the 1920s and again in the decades after the second
World War, and became increasingly urbanized throughout the 1900s.
Conventional single-family residential housing tracts took shape throughout
the community, establishing Westminster as an attractive location for Orange
County residents to put down roots. Shopping centers filled in areas along the
community’s corridors, providing the City’s residents with access to needed
goods and services. This automobile-focused style of urban development
resulted in nearly 25 percent of the City’s land use being devoted to roadways,
making right-of-way the second most common existing land use based on
acres dedicated to the use (after single-family homes). Notably, in Westminster,      The Land Use Plan identifies six

uses combined.                                                                        centers along key corridors including
                                                                                      Westminster Boulevard, Beach
The community’s history of development continues to define the way                    Boulevard, and I-405/SR-22 and around

on reusing or repurposing sites that are underutilized or underperforming.
Future growth and development will be concentrated in the City’s six new
mixed-use areas located along key corridors—Westminster Boulevard, Beach
Boulevard, and I-405/SR-22—and around major destinations such as the Civic
Center, Westminster Mall, and Little Saigon. These areas, which are the
cornerstone of the City’s land use plan, are described in detail on pages 2-11
through 2-17. The land use plan is grounded in the following objectives, which
describe the community’s vision for how Westminster grows:

                                               These land use objectives shape the policy direction provided throughout the

                                               Development, Parks and Recreation, and Housing elements.
                                               The essence of the Land Use element is to provide guidance on preserving the
                                               community’s urban pattern while identifying opportunities for revitalization

                                               repositioning in response to market conditions. The mixing of uses and
                                               densities in key areas helps focus new development away from the
                                               community’s existing residential neighborhoods and promotes reduced
                                               automobile travel and more walking, biking, and transit use, resulting in
                                               improved air quality and a healthier lifestyle for the Westminster community.

Commercial and Industrial Land Uses
Two commercial land uses and two industrial land uses play a key role in
identifying the community’s employment centers and major shopping
destinations. Each commercial and industrial category allows a range of
intensities of development. Building intensities for nonresidential uses are
measured by floor area ratio (FAR). FAR is the ratio of the total net floor area of
a building to the total lot area and describes the intensity of the use on a site.
FAR calculations do not include areas within parking structures or outdoor
open storage areas.
Though FAR guides the overall development size and intensity for
nonresidential buildings, it does not specify the character of the building.
Different interpretations of the same FAR can result in buildings of very
different character. The City’s municipal code specifies other regulations that       This illustration shows how various

                                                     each other, not compete with each other.
                                                     The mixed-use areas identified on the land use plan are predominantly
                                                     located along the City’s corridors and around activity centers where uses are

                                                     Due to the special nature of mixed-use development, additional policy

A variety of uses can be developed either vertically or horizontally within a
single property or multiple properties in mixed-use areas. In general, areas
designated mixed-use are envisioned to develop with a mix of residential and
nonresidential uses, in line with the distribution identified in Table 2-1. The
maximum density permitted in mixed-use areas is 40 dwelling units per acre
and a nonresidential FAR up to 1.0 in allowed—except for Mixed-Use
Westminster Boulevard/Downtown, where the maximum density is 36
dwelling units per acre and a nonresidential maximum FAR of 1.0. The
transition from existing land uses to new development in mixed-use areas will
undoubtedly take a significant amount of time. The City will need to prioritize
which areas to focus on first based on market conditions, staff resources, and
the ability to facilitate new development.
While the density and intensity standards identified for the mixed-use
designation provide a good level of flexibility, projects proposed in mixed-use
areas must demonstrate consistency with the intent of the mixed-use
designation for the specific district in which they are located. If the project
does not support the intent of the designation, a general plan amendment to
a single-use designation may be required. Development in mixed-use areas
may be implemented by a Specific Plan or through conventional zoning
designations. The intent and scale of each mixed-use designation is unique.
Table 2-1 illustrates the preferred mix of uses (by total land area, not
individual parcels) by district. While this mix should be used as a guideline for
development, the ultimate composition of the area may vary in response to
market conditions.

The long-term vision for Westminster Mall calls for mixing traditional retail
uses with new housing, public spaces, and entertainment uses to create an
experience-oriented destination at one of Westminster’s most important
sales-tax-generating centers. New commercial pad sites are encouraged to
infill the existing surface parking area while other parking strategies,
including shared parking and wrapped or screened parking structures, should
be used to ensure sufficient parking is available on-site. A specific plan or
other master planning mechanism for Westminster Mall is required to guide                                           Residential,

20 and 30 du/ac and 3 to 4 stories in height. In the future, if the City would like
to allow residential projects at densities greater than 40 du/ac, the
Westminster Mall area would be well suited to accommodate those types of
projects; however, a general plan amendment would be required to increase
the allowable density.

The Mixed-Use Northwest District designates 88 acres between I-405 and SR-

professional office complexes. Given its adjacency to two major regional
transportation routes, the Northwest District is envisioned to be developed in
coordination with adjacent regional commercial uses.

GOAL LU-2:        LAND USE MIX
A mix of land uses that meets the diverse needs of Westminster’s
residents, offers a variety of employment opportunities, and supports
the development of regional destinations.
Policies
LU-2.1       Places to Live. Provide sites for a range of housing types,
             locations, and densities in a variety of neighborhood settings
             equipped with amenities that support a high quality of life.
LU-2.2       Places to Work. Provide for a broad spectrum of land uses that
             offer job opportunities for Westminster’s residents, including
             commercial, office, industrial, and business parks.
LU-2.3       Places Supporting the Quality of Life. Provide a diversity of
             uses and services supporting Westminster’s residents, such as
             facilities for civic governance and administration, public safety
             (police and fire), seniors and youth, community gatherings, and
             comparable activities.
LU-2.4       Centers of Activity. Promote the development of distinct, well-
             designed, mixed-use destinations that feature residential and
             commercial uses, blend harmoniously with surrounding uses, are
             accessible from transit and walking and biking paths, and serve
             as focal points in the community.
LU-2.5       Balancing Jobs and Housing. Coordinate residential and
             nonresidential planning and development with regional, county,
             and other local agencies to further regional and subregional
             goals for jobs-housing balance.
LU-2.6       Land Use Change. Where opportunities for land use change
             arise, seek input from adjacent property owners, the
             surrounding neighborhood or district, and other stakeholders
             during the consideration process so as to determine
             appropriateness or inform strategies.
LU-2.7       Uses to Meet Daily Needs. Encourage uses that meet daily
             needs, such as grocery stores, local-serving restaurants, and
             other businesses and activities, within walking distance of
             residences to reduce the frequency and length of vehicle trips.
LU-2.8       Development Flexibility. Allow for flexible development
             standards in the City’s zoning code provided that the potential
             benefits and merit of projects can be balanced with potential
             impacts.
LU-2.9       Developable Parcels. Encourage the consolidation of small lots
             into bigger developable parcels to create new opportunities for
             financially viable development that supports the City’s desired
             land use mix.

        GOAL LU-3:       MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT
        Complementary well-designed activity centers that allow people to live
        close to shopping, employment, and public uses, contribute to a
        reduction in automobile use, and provide venues for engaged and
        enhanced pedestrian activity.
        Policies
        LU-3.1      Differentiation of Mixed-Use Areas. Establish and maintain
                    distinct identities for Westminster’s mixed-use areas by
                    customizing uses, scale, form of development, and amenities.
        LU-3.2      Use Configuration. Permit a mixture of compatible land uses on
                    a single site or within a single development project in a vertical
                    or horizontal configuration.
        LU-3.3      Development Scale. Establish standards to ensure that a
                    sufficient scale and footprint of any single use is achieved in
                    mixed-use areas to establish a cohesive environment that
                    minimizes impacts attributable to the adjacency of differing
                    uses. This may define minimum parcel and building sizes,
                    number of housing units, and/or nonresidential square footage,
                    as well as relationships and setbacks among the uses.
        LU-3.4      Corridor Development. Facilitate the redevelopment of the
                    City’s auto-oriented commercial corridors (particularly Beach
                    Boulevard and Westminster Boulevard) by clustering higher
                    density, pedestrian-oriented mixed uses on larger parcels at key
                    intersections, while re-using intervening parcels for housing
                    mixed with neighborhood-oriented commercial services.
        LU-3.5      A Vibrant Civic Center. Leverage City-owned property in the
                    Civic Center to jump-start the redevelopment of the site into a
                    vibrant mixed-use activity center with residential, commercial, and
                    civic uses.
        LU-3.6      A Clearly Identifiable Downtown. Provide for compact and
                    intensified mixed-use development along Westminster Boulevard
                    between Hoover Street and I-405 as a vital, pedestrian-oriented
                    “downtown” that serves as the focal point of community identity
                    and activity, is visually appealing, and is linked to regional and
                    local transit.
        LU-3.7      A Cultural Destination. Continue to support the development
                    of Little Saigon as an international commercial, social, and
                    institutional destination based on Asian cultures and traditions.
        LU-3.8      Implementation Tools. Provide flexible development standards
                    implemented through a specific plan or new development code
                    standards for mixed use that ensure compatibility between
                    allowable uses on site and with adjacent uses.
        LU-3.9      Design Integration. Require that residential and nonresidential
                    portions of mixed-use buildings and sites be integrated through
                    site and building design to ensure compatibility among uses.
        LU-3.10     On-Site Amenities. Require that residential/commercial mixed-
                    use projects provide on-site gathering spaces (plazas,
                    courtyards, etc.) and other pedestrian-scale amenities, such as
                    benches, fountains, and landscaping, that contribute to the
                    living environment of residents, or contribute funds for their
                    development within proximity to the project.

Land Use Buildout Summary
One of the Land Use Element’s primary objectives is to establish the
reasonable long-term buildout potential for housing units, nonresidential
building square footage, population, and employment that could be
generated by the Land Use Plan (Figure 2-2). Buildout capacity is calculated by
three factors: 1) the density and intensity allowed per acre; 2) the number of
acres of land that can be developed as a particular land use; and 3) the
increases in units, population, square footage, and employment associated
with new development at buildout.
The land use buildout summary is not a goal; it simply represents the reasonable
development potential that could occur within the community over the coming
decades. It is used to help determine things such as roadway improvements,
number of parks needed, potential environmental impacts, and mitigation (if
any) required to offset impacts that could occur with implementation of the
General Plan land use vision. The development potential of each individual
parcel is influenced not only by the land use designation, but by market
conditions, physical site characteristics, environmental constraints, infrastructure
requirements, and detailed standards in the zoning code. Therefore, we do not
assume that all parcels develop to their maximum potential (end of the density
or intensity range), because there is inherently some variation in development
types within any given land use.

  1. Acres are given as adjusted gross acreages, which do not include the right-of-way for major roadways, flood control facilities, or railroads.
  2. Density/intensity includes both residential density, expressed as dwelling units per acre, and nonresidential intensity, expressed as floor-area-ratio (FAR),
     which is the amount of building square feet in relation to the size of the lot. Historically, citywide buildout levels do not achieve the maximum allowable
     density/intensity on every parcel and are, on average, lower than allowed by the General Plan. Accordingly, the projections in this General Plan do not
     assume buildout at the maximum density or intensity but are adjusted downward to account for variations in development.
  3. Estimates of population by land use designation are based on reasonable person-per-household factors identified by the 2013 5-Year American Community
     Survey.
  4. A 4.5% vacancy rate was assumed for population based on the 2013 5-Year American Community Survey.
  5. Estimates of jobs by land use designation are based on employment generation rates derived from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (2013)
     Report.
  6. Assumptions for the mix of land uses in each Mixed-Use designation analyzed in the environmental impact analysis are listed in Table 2-1. This mix should be
     used as a guideline for development, but the ultimate composition of the Mixed-Use area may vary in response to market conditions.
  7. Westminster’s proposed General Plan projections refer to realistic long-term development expected under its land use plan over the next 30 to 40 years. The
     projections detailed on this sheet represent a likely amount of development that could occur over the long-term based on average levels of density and
     intensity as properties transition over time.

Land Use Compatibility
As described throughout this element, the City of Westminster features a
range of land use types that should come together harmoniously as new
development projects are proposed. The City must consider the compatibility
between a proposed project and nearby uses. This is of particular importance
when considering the impact of new development next to sensitive land uses
(residential, schools, and care facilities) or the introduction of sensitive land
uses into new areas where similar uses are not already located. For further
direction on project and site design, see the goals and policies identified in
the Community Design Element. Compatibility issues related to noise impacts
are covered in detail at the end of this element.
   Landscape, walls, fences, and enhanced pavement can create soft transitions between
   uses, as pictured above.

        GOAL LU-4:        LAND USE COMPATIBILITY
        Compatible residential, commercial, and industrial development that is
        sensitively integrated with existing development and neighborhoods
        and minimizes impacts on surrounding land uses.
        POLICIES
        LU-4.1       Development Compatibility. Require that development is
                     located and designed to ensure compatibility among land uses,
                     addressing such elements as building orientation and setbacks;
                     buffering; visibility and privacy; automobile and truck access;
                     impacts of noise, lighting, and glare; landscape quality; and
                     aesthetics.
        LU-4.2       Transitions in Scale. Require that the scale and massing of new
                     development in higher-density centers and corridors provide
                     appropriate transitions in building height and bulk that are
                     sensitive to the physical and visual character of lower density
                     adjoining neighborhoods.
        LU-4.3       Code Compliance. Ensure land use compatibility through
                     adherence to the policies, standards, and regulations in the
                     Municipal Code, Development Code, Community Design
                     Element, and other regulations or administrative procedures
                     that manage the form and relationship of projects and uses.
        LU-4.4       Mitigation. Require new uses to provide buffers between
                     existing uses where potential adverse impacts could occur, such
                     as decorative walls, setbacks and landscaping, restricted
                     vehicular access, parking enclosures, and lighting control.
        LU-4.5       Interagency Cooperation. Establish and maintain an ongoing
                     liaison with Caltrans, the railroads, utility companies, and other
                     major government and private agencies to help minimize the
                     traffic, noise, and visual impacts of their facilities and operations.
        LU-4.6       Residential Compatibility. Discourage duplexes, triplexes,
                     quadplexes, and apartments from being constructed in
                     predominantly single-family residential neighborhoods to
                     preserve the character and integrity of neighborhoods.
        LU-4.7       Commercial and Industrial Development. Require new
                     commercial and industrial developments to clearly demonstrate
                     that they will have no significant detrimental impacts upon the
                     City and its residents, including, but not limited to, significant
                     adverse traffic, noise, air pollution, and fiscal impacts.
        LU-4.8       Single-Family Home Size and Scale. Consider the size and
                     scale of new homes proposed in single-family neighborhoods
                     when evaluating the compatibility of a proposed project with
                     the existing environment.
2-26 City of Westminster General Plan | Land Use
Community and Military Land Use Planning
The City of Westminster is also required to consider, as part of its Land Use
Element, the compatibility between land uses in the City and nearby military
facilities, in particular compatibility with airports and military operations and
readiness. For Westminster, two relevant facilities are located nearby: the Los
Alamitos Joint Forces Training Case (JFTB) and the Naval Weapons Station
Seal Beach.
Airport Compatibility
Approximately 50 percent of Westminster (generally north of Westminster
Boulevard and west of Goldenwest Street) is within the airport planning area
of the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base (JFTB), which is northwest of
Westminster in the City of Los Alamitos. The JFTB is home to an Army Aviation
Support Facility and the 1st Battalion of the 140th Aviation Regiment of the
California Army National Guard, as well as other units not related to aviation.
The JFTB is within the oversight of the Orange County Airport Land Use
Commission (ALUC), which is required to prepare and adopt an airport
environs land use plan (AELUP) for each of the airports within its jurisdiction.
The AELUP is a land use compatibility plan that is intended to protect the
public from adverse effects of aircraft noise, to ensure that people and
facilities are not concentrated in areas susceptible to aircraft accidents, and to
ensure that no structures or activities adversely affect navigable space.
Although half of the City of Westminster is within the airport planning area,
the noise contours of the airport do not encroach into the community, as
illustrated on Figure 2-3, Airport Land Use Planning. The ALUC is also
responsible for reviewing applications for the development of new heliports.
The only existing heliport within the City limits is the Huntington Beach
Service Center Heliport.
The AELUP identifies standards for development in the airport’s planning area
based on noise contours, accident-potential zones, and building heights.
Land uses in Westminster that are within the airport planning area
boundaries, as delineated on Figure 2-3, are required to conform to safety,
height, and noise restrictions established in the AELUP for the JFTB. Goal and
policy direction supporting these restrictions is provided in this section to
ensure long-term land use compatibility with JFTB operations.
                                   City of Westminster General Plan | Land Use     2-27

        GOAL LU-5:        AIRPORT LAND USE PLANNING
        Development that is consistent with the Airport Environs Land Use
        Plans for the Joint Forces Training Base and Orange County heliports.
        Policies
        LU-5.1       Airport      Operations        Monitoring.     Maintain     regular
                     communication and coordination with Joint Force Training Base
                     (JFTB), Los Alamitos, and request advance notice of any
                     operations that could adversely impact the community, even if
                     those impacts are temporary.
        LU-5.2       Federal Aviation Regulation Part 77. Do not approve buildings
                     and structures that would penetrate Federal Aviation Regulation
                     (FAR) Part 77 Imaginary Obstruction Surfaces for JFTB Los
                     Alamitos unless found consistent by the Orange County Airport
                     Land Use Commission (ALUC). Additionally, in accordance with
                     FAR Part 77, require applicants proposing buildings or structures
                     that penetrate the 100:1 Notification Surface to file a Form 7460-
                     1 Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration with the Federal
                     Aviation Administration (FAA) and provide a copy of the FAA
                     determination to the City and the ALUC.
        LU-5.3       Structures above 200 Feet. For development projects with
                     structures higher than 200 feet above existing grade, the City
                     shall inform the ALUC and submit materials to the ALUC for
                     review. Proposed projects that would exceed a height of 200 feet
                     above existing grade shall be required to file Form 7460-1 with
                     the FAA.
        LU-5.4       Heliport/Helistop Approval and Requirements. Approve the
                     development of a heliport or helistop only if it complies with the
                     AELUP for heliports. Ensure that each applicant seeking a
                     conditional use permit or similar approval for the construction or

Military Operations and Readiness
The military is responsible for installations, ranges, airspace, and facilities in
the interest of national security. These Military Operations Areas (MOAs)
require coordination to ensure that adjacent land uses and those land uses
within the vicinity of Military Operations Areas are compatible with and
support military training and testing missions.
Recognizing the importance of the Military’s mission in California and the
jurisdiction’s role in land use planning, the City of Westminster must consider
the impact of new growth on military readiness activities carried out in the
jurisdiction when designating land uses and proposing zoning ordinances on
lands adjacent to military facilities or underlying designated military
operational areas.
The City’s General Plan sets the framework for a process to identify,
coordinate and assist in resolving potential land use conflicts within or under
MOAs to ensure that new development is compatible with military
operations, safeguard mission training and testing requirements, and support
military readiness. New development will be reviewed and regulated to avoid
impact to MOAs and maintain public safety.

                                                 making land use decisions and shows a range of noise standards for various
                                                 land use categories.
                                                 Noise Standards
                                                 Chapter 8.28, Noise Control, of the Westminster Municipal Code regulates noise
                                                 at its source (except transportation sources), protects noise-sensitive land uses,
                                                 regulates vibration levels, and specifies permitted periods for construction and
                                                 grading. The City regulates noise levels based on two noise zones. The entire City
                                                 is designated Noise Zone 1, except multifamily properties, which are designated
                                                 Noise Zone 2. These zones protect noise-sensitive areas (residential) without
                                                 excessively inhibiting nonsensitive areas (industrial). Chapter 8.28 also defines
 Construction could generate noise impacts       how noise is measured as well as special uses that are exempt from the City’s
that must be mitigated so adjacent uses are      noise regulations. The goal and associated policies, below, should be used in
                 not singificantly impacted.     tandem with the direction provided in the municipal code.

  Notes: Compatibility zones indicate the degree to which the land uses listed are compatible with the noise levels (CNEL)
  shown in the table.
  Zone A. Clearly Compatible. Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are
  of normal conventional construction without any special noise insulation requirements.
  Zone B. Normally Compatible. New construction or development should be undertaken only after detailed analysis of the
  noise reduction requirements are made and needed noise insulation features in the design are determined. Conventional
  construction, with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning, will normally suffice.
  Zone C. Normally Incompatible. New construction or development should normally be discouraged. If new construction or
  development does proceed, a detailed analysis or noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation
  features must be included in the design.
  Zone D. Clearly Incompatible. New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.

        GOAL LU-7:       NOISE
        Community noise and vibration levels that balance the need for
        peaceful environments for sensitive land uses with the needs of local
        businesses and regional land uses.
        Policies
        LU-7.1      Land Use Noise Compatibility. Assess the compatibility of
                    proposed land uses with the noise environment when preparing,
                    revising, or reviewing development project applications.
        LU-7.2      Noise Insulation and Vibration Standards. Require new
                    projects to comply with noise insulation and vibration standards
                    of local, regional, and state building code regulations.
        LU-7.3      Sensitive Facilities. Locate sensitive facilities such as schools,
                    hospitals, libraries, churches, and convalescent homes away
                    from sources of excessive noise unless proper mitigation
                    measures are in place.
        LU-7.4      Noise Control. Utilize noise abatement, design techniques, and
                    other mitigation strategies—including staggered operating
                    hours, insulation, building setbacks, noise barriers, insulation,
                    placement of parking and utility areas, and building
                    orientation—to ensure that noise levels do not exceed the limits
                    in the Westminster Municipal Code.
        LU-7.5      Roadway Noise. Encourage nonmotorized transportation
                    alternatives for local trips and the implementation of noise
                    sensitivity measures, including traffic-calming road design,
                    lateral separation, natural buffers, and setbacks to decrease
                    excessive motor vehicle noise along major arterials.
        LU-7.6      Highway Noise. Continue to coordinate with the California
                    Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to achieve maximum
                    noise abatement in the design of new highway projects or
                    improvements along 1-405 and SR 22; abatement techniques
                    could include alignment, barriers, lateral separation, or other
                    techniques.
        LU-7.7      Railroad Noise. Continue to coordinate with railroad companies
                    to support and maintain reasonable limits on rail traffic, the use
                    of bells and whistles, and the speed and hours of rail operation
                    in affected areas of the City, and maintain adequate setbacks
                    and buffer zones along rail lines to reduce adverse noise impacts
                    on sensitive receptors.
        LU-7.8      Interjurisdictional Coordination. Coordinate with Orange
                    County and the cities of Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Garden
                    Grove, and Fountain Valley to minimize noise conflicts between
                    land uses along the City's boundaries.

Related Plans, Programs, and Legislation
The Land Use Element supports and implements several state and local laws
and plans.
Municipal Code and Zoning Ordinance
The City of Westminster Municipal Code and Zoning Ordinance are the
primary tools used to implement the goals and policies of the General Plan.
Each of the General Plan land use designations is implemented by a
correlating set of zoning designations described in the zoning ordinance. The
zoning ordinance provides more detailed direction related to development
standards; permitted, conditionally permitted, and prohibited uses; and other
regulations such as parking standards and sign regulations. The land uses
specified in the zoning ordinance are based upon and should be consistent
with the land use policies in this element. Changes to the zoning ordinance
may be necessary due to the adoption of provisions in this General Plan and
could require changes to the zoning maps and development standards.
It should be noted that there need not be an equal number of land use
designations and zoning classifications. In many instances, multiple zoning
classifications may be consistent with a single General Plan land use
designation. The maximum allowable development potential of each
individual parcel is influenced not only by the land use designation, but by
physical site characteristics, environmental constraints, infrastructure
requirements, and detailed standards provided in the development code.
Actual development is expected to typically occur at levels less than the
allowed maximums due to the factors stated above as well as market demand
and development trends.
Specific Plans
The General Plan provides overall guidance for the physical development of
the City, and specific plans are used to provide more detailed regulatory
guidance for special areas or large developments within the City. Specific
plans generally comprise a land use plan, circulation plan, development
standards, design guidelines, phasing plan, infrastructure plan (water, sewer,
or drainage), and implementation plan, pursuant to California Governmental
Code Sections 65450 through 65457. They are typically implemented as
customized zoning for a particular area of the City and are generally used for
large-scale projects that require a comprehensive approach to planning and
infrastructure issues. As of 2016, the City had one approved Specific Plan—
the Moran Street Specific Plan—which provides guidance for approximately
20 acres in and around Little Saigon.

        Development Agreements
        State law allows for the preparation of a development agreement between a
        project proponent and the City. A development agreement provides the
        developer with additional assurance that the policies, rules and regulations,
        and conditions of approval in effect at the time a project was approved will
        not be nullified by a future local policy or regulation change. In exchange, the
        developer may be required to meet certain conditions or performance
        criteria, which become part of the agreement. A development agreement can
        be a useful means of meeting General Plan goals and policies while removing
        some of the risks faced by the developer. Agreements can remain in effect for
        a few or several years; this is typically specified in the development
        agreement terms.
        Southern California Association of Governments’ Regional
        Transportation Plan / Sustainable Communities Strategy
        The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is a long-range transportation plan
        developed and updated by SCAG every four years. The RTP identifies
        transportation strategies to address regional mobility needs using growth
        forecasts and economic projections over a 20-year period. The Sustainable
        Communities Strategy (SCS) is a newly required element of the RTP that
        integrates land use and transportation strategies to achieve emissions
        reduction targets set by the California Air Resources Board. In May of 2016,
        the Regional Council of SCAG adopted the 2016-2040 RTP/SCS: A Plan for
        Mobility, Accessibility, Sustainability and a High Quality of Life. The 2016–
        2040 RTP/SCS provides a blueprint for improving quality of life for Southern
        California residents by providing more transportation choices.
        Senate Bill 244: Disadvantaged Communities
        Senate Bill (SB) 244 requires cities and counties to address the infrastructure
        needs of unincorporated disadvantaged communities in general plans. A
        disadvantaged community is an unincorporated fringe, island, or legacy
        community in which the median household income is 80 percent or less of
        the statewide median household income. In addition to identifying
        disadvantaged communities, SB 244 requires cities to analyze the water,
        wastewater, stormwater drainage, and structural fire protection needs and
        financial funding alternatives for the extension of services to identified
        disadvantaged communities. The Infrastructure and Natural Resources
        Element addresses this requirement for water, wastewater, and stormwater
        drainage, and the Public Health and Safety Element addresses fire protection
        needs.

decision making by elected and appointed officials, City staff, and people and            Program
businesses that have invested in or are considering investing in Westminster.
Another key purpose of the Economic Development Element is to ensure that
Westminster’s future growth and development is fiscally sustainable and
resilient to external shocks. Fiscal sustainability includes land use and
development patterns that generate municipal revenues equal to or in excess of
the amount needed to pay for public facilities and services. It also includes
policies that incorporate fiscal thinking into public decision making about land
use and development as well as other issues.
Finally, the Economic Development Element establishes the basic foundation
by which the City has and will continue to institutionalize economic
development as a core function. Although an economic development
strategy will provide much of the detail on local activities, the fact that
Westminster chose to include an economic development element in the
General Plan is evidence of the City’s long-term commitment to community
economic well-being.
Organization of Element
Economic development is growth in and diversification of the local economy
that achieves a growing tax base and community-defined outcomes. In
Westminster, the community has identified the following outcomes, listed in
priority order, to be realized from economic development. The goals and           The Miriam Warne Community Building,

                                                  visitors. The General Plan discourages providing the same retail chains in the

                                                  The City’s most significant economic development opportunities will likely
                                                  occur in the community’s six mixed-use areas (as described in detail in the
                                                  land use element), which are located around key destinations—the Civic

                                                  corridors: Westminster Boulevard, Beach Boulevard, and I-405/SR-22. To

                                                  and changes in the market may necessitate that the City reevaluate its
                                                  economic development opportunities; if new opportunities are identified, this

                                                  The Civic Center
                                                  The Civic Center is generally the area between 13th Street, Westminster

the court and other public services would provide a strong customer base
that would make the Civic Center a desirable location for retail and dining.
The City can explore ways to consolidate municipal functions and make more
land available for development. The City’s ownership of land in this area
opens the door for potential public-private partnerships. Leveraging these
land holdings could reduce or eliminate the need for public investment in
public realm improvements.
Downtown: Westminster Boulevard
Infill development and redevelopment in the area around Sigler Park and
Westminster Center (a 433,000-square-foot community-scale shopping
center) could transform this part of Westminster Boulevard into a walkable
mixed-use downtown district. With its location and the existing draw of the
Westminster Center, a downtown district in this location may well attract
customers from Cypress, Huntington Beach, and other cities.
To create a walkable downtown, there would need to be investment in the
public realm—roadway improvements, sidewalks, landscaping, public parking,
etc.—in addition to investments by property owners for new buildings,
refurbishment or expansion of existing buildings, façade improvements, and
landscaping and parking improvements. To fund the public improvements, a
special funding and financing district would likely be necessary (e.g., a
landscaping and lighting maintenance district or a business improvement
district).
The City should begin this transformation by engaging stakeholders, property
owners, businesses, and residents to create a Downtown Westminster Vision
Plan. The Vision should identify any needed regulatory changes (unique design
guidelines, or a specific plan, etc.), desired physical changes (streetscape,
circulation, etc.), organization and marketing framework (business improvement
district or Main Street organization), and funding mechanisms (special districts).
Beach Boulevard
Beach Boulevard—also known as State Route (SR) 39—is Westminster’s primary
north-south commercial corridor and the community’s most traveled roadway.
In Westminster, Beach Boulevard intersects with I-405 and SR-22, and is often
used as a local cut-through corridor for drivers looking to transition from one
freeway to the other. Given the corridor’s prominence, the impression of many
people living, working, and visiting Westminster is heavily influenced by what
they see on Beach Boulevard. Development along the corridor is primarily
composed of strip-commercial retail centers. Along some portions of the
corridor, one or both sides of the roadway are part of the community’s
unincorporated county islands. The City has designated the area where Beach
Boulevard meets Westminster Boulevard as Mixed-Use Corridor, which places
special emphasis on high-quality landscaping, setbacks, and right-of-way
                                                                                   The Westminster Gateway Shopping

boundary, this center is well positioned to attract retail spending from other
cities. The General Plan recognizes the importance of the Westminster
Gateway retail center. However, the Plan does not envision major
development changes at this center or in the surrounding areas.

                                               Little Saigon
                                               Little Saigon has a highly complex trade area because it is a truly niche
                                               market. Its customer base can be divided into three basic categories. First,
                                               there are many Vietnamese immigrants and people of Vietnamese ancestry
                                               who live in the immediate area (especially Westminster and Garden Grove)
                                               and regularly come to Little Saigon specifically for its Vietnamese businesses,
                                               including shopping, dining, and entertainment. Second, there are a number
                                               of visitors from the Southern California region who come here seeking an
                                               authentic Vietnamese cultural experience. Finally, Little Saigon continues to
                                               attract tourists from around the world who are excited to experience the
                                               largest concentration of Vietnamese businesses outside of Vietnam.
                                               The City has already adopted plans to help the uses in Little Saigon transition

                                               economic development needs in the area include a coordinated marketing

                                               Westminster Mall
                                               Situated adjacent to I-405 and the City boundary, Westminster Mall attracts
                                               many visitors—and their retail spending—from outside of the City.
                                               Nevertheless, Westminster Mall competes with many other regional shopping
                                               centers, including South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Bella Terra in Huntington
                                               Beach, and Long Beach Town Center.
                                               The economic analysis prepared for the General Plan update found little
                                               leaked spending and few, if any, opportunities to grow retail spending
                                               through attracting new stores. Rather, increases in retail spending would
                                               come through out-competing other regional retail destinations.
                                               The General Plan recognizes that at some point in the future, the owners of
                                               the mall may wish to consider adding residential uses and transforming it into
                                               more of a mixed-use destination. Revitalization could be addressed through a
                                               master plan, specific plan, or similar mechanism and a development
                                               agreement that defines City benefits and investment. The Land Use Element
                                               includes provisions that would accommodate such a transition.
                                               Northwest District: I-405/SR-22
                                               The Land Use Plan also identifies an opportunity for mixed-use development
                                               where I-405 and SR-22 merge, referred to as the Northwest District. Although
                                               this area represents a key long-term development area in Westminster, the
                                               challenges involved in transitioning the existing mobile home community to
                                               another use has led the City to prioritize the other areas identified above.

Quality of Life
Better quality of life is the planned outcome of bringing to Westminster new
businesses that provide the goods and services that the community feels it
lacks. The community also defined other ways to improve the quality of life:
»    Improve the look and feel of Westminster with more landscaping,
     attractive streetscapes, updated building facades, and a distinctive
     community identity and image.
»    Create distinct gateways at major entry points.
»    Develop more destinations in Westminster, especially walkable, mixed-
     use districts and a downtown area.
These improvements would require public investment, but they also require a
thriving economy so that businesses and property owners realize enough
profit to reinvest in their properties.
The community also expressed desires for more good restaurants, with a
greater variety in cuisine and price; more medical care services, such as a
hospital or clinic; and more grocery stores, with a greater variety in scale and       Medical facilities, such as Kindred

3-6 City of Westminster General Plan | Economic Development

Westminster’s Tax Base and Fiscal Vitality
This economic development outcome—an expanded and diversified tax
base—reflects the community’s desire for economic growth to produce
public benefits. Generating additional municipal revenues should support
new and improved public facilities and services. During the General Plan
process, the community expressed “desires” for improvements to and
expansions of a broad range of public facilities—underground utilities,
recreation facilities, road improvements, and bike and pedestrian facilities—
and public services such as code enforcement, public art, recreation
programs, and special events.
The 2008–09 recession and the state’s elimination of redevelopment agencies
greatly reduced the City’s revenue. At adoption of this General Plan Update,
the City is still working to close its long-term structural budget deficit.
Funding desired public facilities and services will require either growing
revenues by expanding and diversifying the tax base, or establishing new
revenue streams  through special funding and financing districts, such as
assessment districts, community facilities districts, or business improvement
districts.
GOAL ED-2: TAX BASE
A financially healthy city government with a balanced mix of land uses
and special funding and financing districts that increase resources to
invest in public facilities and services.
POLICIES
ED-2.1       Fiscal Decision Making. Incorporate short-term and long-term
             economic and fiscal impacts of proposed actions into municipal
             decision making.
ED-2.2       Leveraging Private Investment. When deciding where to
             invest public resources and how much to invest, consider the
             degree to which the public investment will leverage private
             sector investment, whether through development and
             redevelopment or through the establishment of financing
             mechanisms, such as assessment districts, business
             improvement districts, and infrastructure finance districts.
ED-2.3       Taking Account of Public Resources. Periodically assess the
             accuracy of projections for staff time and City financial resources,
             and use the assessment results to evaluate and improve fiscal
             decision making.
ED-2.4       Land Use Plan Changes. Require the following provisions for
             general plan amendments that are not part of a City-initiated
             comprehensive amendment, update, or specific plan:
              Because retail uses provide sales taxes and lodging uses
                   provide transient occupancy taxes, they are the most
                   lucrative sources of revenue. General plan amendments that
                   change a land use from a designation that permits retail or
                   lodging uses to one that does not should be evaluated for
                   fiscal impacts. Such a change should only be considered in
                   conjunction with a development agreement or other legally
                   enforceable obligation on the property owner(s) that
                  City of Westminster General Plan | Economic Development         3-7

                       requires the subject property to generate the same or better
                       fiscal balance for the City.
                   The City may require a development agreement and/or a
                       fiscal impact analysis and mitigation of any short- or long-
                       term negative fiscal impacts for a requested general plan
                       amendment.
       ED-2.5     Public Costs Associated with Development. Encourage and
                  facilitate development projects to establish new or participate in
                  existing special funding and financing districts for the cost of
                  associated public facilities, infrastructure, and increased public
                  services that align with City goals. The City Council may establish
                  and from time to time change the amount to be recovered from
                  such districts, taking into account the financial feasibility impacts
                  on development generally (not on a project-by-project basis)
                  given regional competition for development and weighed
                  against the public’s need for and the City’s ability to pay for such
                  facilities, infrastructure, and services.
       ED-2.6     Special Districts. When community-desired facilities and
                  services are beyond the City’s financial resources to provide,
                  support community-driven efforts to establish special funding
                  and financing districts, such as assessment districts, landscape
                  and lighting maintenance districts, business improvement
                  districts, or community facilities districts, whether citywide or
                  limited to a defined neighborhood, district, or corridor.
       ED-2.7     Development Support for Fiscal Vitality. Secure
                  developments that serve the economic needs of the community
                  and effectively sustain or increase the City’s ability to provide all
                  public services and maintenance demands.
3-8 City of Westminster General Plan | Economic Development

Jobs and Income
The expanded job opportunities outcome could be achieved through the
growth and expansion of existing businesses and the attraction of new
businesses to Westminster. In 2014, only 7.2 percent of employed
Westminster residents worked in the City. The economic analysis for the
General Plan update found that several economic sectors (especially
manufacturing; wholesale trade; and professional, scientific, and technical
services) employ many Westminster residents in other cities. These sectors
alone have the potential to employ thousands of Westminster residents
currently working elsewhere. The outcome of increased real wages and
household income entails improving and expanding Westminster residents’
access to education, training, and career services. The economic analysis for
the General Plan update found that the median household income in
Westminster in 2012 was lower than the medians for Orange County and
California, and it was 14 percent lower than the median in four comparison
cities. Besides benefitting residents, increases in household income could
translate to increased retail spending in the City.
GOAL ED-3: JOBS AND INCOME
A local economy and business climate that generate new jobs in
Westminster, foster increases in household income, and nurture
entrepreneurship.
POLICIES
ED-3.1        Employment Needs of Residents. When considering the
              investment of public resources, give priority to investments that
              support the retention, expansion, and attraction of businesses
              that provide jobs suited to the education, skills, and occupations
              of Westminster residents.
ED-3.2        Competitive Employment Centers. Encourage office and
              industrial employment centers that provide competitive
              advantages to businesses seeking to locate or expand in the
              region and that increase the number of jobs in the City.
ED-3.3        Economic Development Services. Help existing businesses
              communicate their workforce needs to regional workforce
              development partners and school district partners. Collaborate
              with regional economic development partners to market
              Westminster to potential new businesses. Collaborate with
              regional business development and educational partners to
              publicize the educational and training assistance available to
              Westminster residents, including training to start up and grow
              businesses.
ED-3.4        Business Retention and Expansion. Facilitate and invest in
              programs and services that retain and help expand existing
              office and industrial business.
ED-3.5        Business Attraction. Facilitate and invest in programs and
              services that attract new office-based businesses in order to
              minimize office vacancies in Westminster and to support the
              development in new offices consistent with the land use plan.
ED-3.6        A Balanced Business Mix. Achieve a balanced mix of land use
              activities and a competitive level of development that optimize
              economic growth among all business sectors.
ED-3.7        New Development. For new industrial development, discourage
              small, isolated pockets of industrial land uses and encourage
              industrial development that incorporates a business park
              subdivision design and permits individual developable lots.

        Economic Development Program
        The Economic Development Element presents a long-term focus on ensuring
        the City’s future prosperity and provides goals and policies that are intended to
        stand the test of time. However, economic and market forces can change,
        sometimes very quickly. A key implementation action for economic
        development is the adoption and periodic updating of an economic
        development program, which provides a short-term action plan identifying the
        projects, programs, and investments needed to achieve short- and midterm
        objectives that work toward long-term goals. The City should update the
        strategy consistently, typically every three to five years. Each update, however,
        should elaborate on how the strategy is addressing the Economic Development
        Element’s long-term goals.
        GOAL ED-4: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
        Effective local programs and partnerships that support local economic
        development.

                       goals of this element. The strategy may include additional,
                       shorter-term goals that are not in conflict with this element.
                       Upon adoption of an economic development strategy, the
                       following shall apply:
                        Prioritize the investment of public resources based on the
                            adopted strategy.
                        Annually review the effectiveness of the economic
                            development strategy.
                        Every three to five years, comprehensively review the

                       connect existing businesses with regional economic
                       development service providers as needed and to make regional
                       economic development services providers aware of the needs of
                       Westminster businesses.
        ED-4.4         Real Estate Brokers. Establish and maintain robust partnerships
                       with commercial and industrial real estate brokers and
                       developers to market Westminster to potential new businesses.
        ED-4.5         Economic Development Training. Integrate economic and
                       fiscal thinking throughout the City organization and provide

The formation of community in Westminster is grounded in the City’s                    Preservation and

corridors that generally arose in the 1950s (similar to many cities in Orange     »    Cultural Resources
County and particularly those neighboring Westminster). Shifting
socioeconomic demographics and housing preferences have shaped the mix
of uses identified for the future of Westminster. With a contemporary
approach of mixing uses, integrating infill development along corridors, and
creating activity centers in select areas, Westminster is at the forefront of
placemaking and planning in Orange County.
Organization of Element
The goals and policies of this element are organized around five topics:
»    Community Image and Placemaking. Features that create a distinctive
     community identity and special sense of place for Westminster.
»    Design Quality. Guidance for building and site design and architectural
     treatments to create livable and sustainable projects that convey a
     quality image of the city.
»    Enhanced Corridors and Intersections. Corridors warranting special
     treatment as primary roadways or key access points for the community
     and visitors.
»    Neighborhood Preservation and Enhancement. Approaches to
     maintain and enhance the City’s established residential neighborhoods.
»    Cultural Resources. Preservation of the City’s ethnic resources (Little    Enhancing Westminster’s unique
     Saigon), historic structures and artifacts, and paleontological and        identity through landscape, signage,
     archaeological resources.                                                  and other design techniques will help

                                               Placemaking is a people-oriented approach to the planning, design and

                                               Since Westminster is largely built out, opportunities to “create place”
                                               primarily come from improvements to existing streetscapes and the
                                               opportunity to create new squares, plazas or other gathering spaces as
                                               existing uses and properties (particularly along Beach and Westminster
                                               Boulevards) transition and redevelop over time. Quality design will become
                                               increasingly important as infill projects begin to change the look and feel of
                                               the City’s corridors.
                                               The Community Design Element is intended to enhance Westminster’s current

Community Design Objectives
The goals and policies in this chapter are intended to stimulate (not stifle)
design creativity, and to set expectations for the design quality that is desired
by the community. While the objectives of the Community Design Element
(listed below) generally focused on citywide, district-, and neighborhood-
level details, the City’s zoning ordinance and design guidelines further refine
the objectives at the project and parcel level and must support the goals and
policies identified in the Element.
      1.   Reinforce/strengthen the community identity of Westminster.
      2.   Preserve and enhance the visual quality of the City.
      3.   Promote interaction between people and foster healthier, more
           social and economically viable communities
      4.   Protect and strengthen the sense of place and character of
           neighborhoods.
      5.   Enhance vehicular and pedestrian corridors through the use of
           consistent landscaping and design features.
      6.   Enhance the energy, vitality, and character of the City’s gathering
           spaces, especially in mixed-use districts.
      7.   Improve upon the architectural quality of Westminster.
      8.   Encourage environmentally friendly and sustainable design and
           building practices.
   The Miriam Warne Community Building demonstrates a high quality of design and
   features enhanced landscaping and building materials. It is also home to the City of
   Westminster Chamber of Commerce; the signage of the building complements the
   architecture and reflects a positive image of the community.

                                         Community Image and Placemaking
                                         An attractive and unified community appearance not only increases residents’
                                         sense of pride, but creates a positive climate for business and makes a
                                         pleasant impression on visitors. The City of Westminster's image is defined by
                                         its districts/activity centers (mixed-use areas) and collection of unique
                                         neighborhoods. While it is important to retain the character of the City's
                                         activity centers and neighborhoods, it is equally important to ensure a
                                         comprehensive and cohesive community identity through the
                                         implementation of strategic design elements. The community image can be
                                         reinforced by carefully placed and well-designed gateways at primary
                                         entrances to the City; these gateways define the boundaries of the City and
                                         create a sense of arrival. Key gateways into Westminster are identified on

Design Quality
Physical improvements will help Westminster achieve vibrant places,
enhanced value, and livability throughout the City. Physical improvements
include overall site design, landscaping, building design and orientation,
urban plazas, architectural details, site furniture, building materials, and land
use buffers and transitions. Projects and buildings shall be designed with
consideration for adjacent land uses, and when incompatibilities arise,
projects may be required to provide sufficient land use buffers and transitions
to ensure a harmonious environment.
GOAL CD-2:        DESIGN QUALITY
Projects, developments, and public spaces that visually enhance the
character of the community, reinforce civic pride and public safety,
discourage blight, and appropriately buffer dissimilar land uses so that
the differences in type and intensity do not conflict.

CD-2.1       Special Site Features. Preserve positive characteristics and
             unique features of a site during the design and development of a
             new project; the relationship to scale and character of adjacent
             uses should be considered.
                                                                                  Public art can celebrate the diversity

             site design and construction. This includes, but is not limited to:
             appropriate placement of facilities; undergrounding of utilities,
             where possible; and aesthetic design (e.g., cell tower stealthing).
CD-2.3       Older Neighborhoods and Businesses. Develop or participate
             in programs to rehabilitate older residential neighborhoods and
             commercial centers to prevent blight and maintain the quality of
             the built environment.
CD-2.4       Parking in Mixed-Use Areas. Design parking lots and structures
             in mixed-use areas to be functionally and visually integrated into
             and connected with new projects or adjacent buildings; off-
             street parking lots should not dominate the streetscene or
             should be screened by enhanced landscaping to minimize the
             view.
CD-2.5       Gathering Spaces in Mixed-Use Areas. Integrate plaza or
             gathering spaces in new mixed-use developments, and explore
             ways to creatively integrate outdoor dining, seating, or other
             activity-generating features into project design.
CD-2.6       Public Art. Consider including public art that reflects the
             diversity of the City at key gateways, major projects, and public
             gathering places.

Enhanced Corridors and Intersections
Corridors play an important role in Westminster. Not only are they essential for
circulation, they provide valuable opportunities to reinforce the City's community
identity through streetscape façade improvements and building design. Design
treatments within corridors should have cohesive, yet clearly differentiated
design features that reflect the type and extent of uses along it.
To help foster a strong identity along major corridors, the City has designated a
number of north-south and east-west roadways as “enhanced corridors” (see
Figure CD-1). Roadways in this designation are recognized as major transportation
routes and will receive special design consideration to ensure they complement
the community. The City's visual appearance from freeways and along
prominent roadways such as Beach Boulevard is particularly important because
it helps visually frame and distinguish the City from adjacent jurisdictions.

Cultural Resources
Cultural resources in Westminster are comprised of ethnic resources (Little
Saigon), historic structures and artifacts, and paleontological and
archaeological resources. These resources serve to preserve its rich cultural
history and lend insight into the scientific progress, environmental
adaptations and human advancements in the region. The preservation of
cultural resources in Westminster will help future generations understand the
community’s complex history and appreciate its diverse ethnic composition.
Ethnic Resources: Little Saigon
Founded by the Presbyterian Reverend Lemuel P. Webber in 1870, the
Westminster agricultural community has developed into the estimated
90,000-person City it is today in just over 145 years. Now one of the most
diverse cultural communities in Southern California, the City’s most
prominent cultural change was triggered in the 1970s, with the immigration
of Vietnamese refugees into Westminster. The success of the Vietnamese
integration into the American social, political, and business systems is evident
in the growing success of the Little Saigon district, the oldest, largest and
                                                                                  Little Saigon is a major cultural resource

destinations. Today, Little Saigon has over 500 businesses that largely cater to
the region’s Vietnamese community. This area has its own special design
aesthetic and the City continues to support it as a mixed-use destination.
Historic Resources
The State Historical Resources Commission designed the California Register of
Historical Resources program for use by state and local agencies, private
groups and citizens to identify, evaluate, register and protect California's
historical resources.
The Register is the authoritative guide to the state's significant historical and
archeological resources. It encourages public recognition and protection of
resources of architectural, historical, archeological and cultural significance,
identifies historical resources for state and local planning purposes,
determines eligibility for state historic preservation grant funding and affords
certain protections under environmental review.
To be eligible for listing in the California Register, a resource must meet at
least one of the following criteria:
»    Associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
     broad patterns of local or regional history or the cultural heritage of
     California or the United States
»    Associated with the lives of persons important to local, California or
     national history
»    Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region or
     method of construction or represents the work of a master or possesses
     high artistic values
»    Has yielded, or has the potential to yield, information important to the
     prehistory or history of the local area, California or the nation
In addition to having significance, resources must have integrity for the
period of significance. Simply, resources must retain enough of their historic
character or appearance to be recognizable as historical resources and to
convey the reasons for their significance. A resource that has lost its historic

                                            Register, if it maintains the potential to yield significant scientific or historical
                                            information or specific data.
                                            Approximately 100 historical buildings in the City are listed on the California
                                            Historical Resources Inventory, which means they have been evaluated for
                                            listing on a local register, the California Register of Historical Resources, or the
                                            National Register of Historic Places, or for federal tax credit certifications.
                                            (note that listing on the Historical Resources Inventory does not mean that a
                                            resource is considered historically significant). In addition, some buildings
                                            listed on the Inventory have since been demolished but not removed from
                                            the Inventory (i.e., the Westminster School/Seventeenth Street School, which
                                            was at the center of the 1947 Westminster v. Mendez case). As a result, the
                                            number of buildings with historic significance in Westminster is likely much
                                            lower than the number identified on the Inventory. The majority of the
                                            buildings on the Inventory are single-family homes, the oldest of which was
                                            built in 1939, but the list also includes commercial, government, and school
                                            buildings. Buildings less than 45 years of age are typically not evaluated for
                                            eligibility for listing on the California Register of Historical Resources.
                                            In addition to those buildings listed on the inventory, there are additional
                                            places of local significance in Westminster which at the very least should be
                                            considered for designation as local landmarks within the community. This

      the City because it relates directly to the physical form and character of
      development resulting from implementation of the Land Use and Mobility
      elements.
      Westminster Municipal Code and Design Guidelines
      Manual
      In Westminster, design of a project is evaluated under two different
      documents: Title 17, Zoning, of the Westminster Municipal Code (WMC) and
      the City’s Design Guidelines Manual; both documents should reflect the
      goals, policies, and action items in this element. Future development should
      reflect the intentions of the Community Design Element and should consult
      the applicable zoning ordinance sections, specific plans, design guidelines,
      and other provisions in the municipal code when appropriate.
      The WMC, including specific plans, includes development and design
      standards that are mandatory and required under the provisions of the
      Zoning Ordinance. It provides specific development standards to implement
      the goals and policies in the General Plan. Direction related to setbacks,
      heights, parking and open space requirements, lighting, and similar issues is
      provided in the zoning and municipal codes.
      The Guidelines—a separate document adopted by resolution—are intended
      to supplement the development requirements and regulations contained in
      the WMC to assure quality design of developments within the city that
      promote the health, safety and general welfare of the community. The
      Guidelines are tools to be used by developers during the project design
      phase and by City decision-makers during the development review process.
      The goal of the Guidelines is to encourage creative architectural and site
      planning solutions consistent with the overall context of surrounding
      commercial, industrial and residential developments.
      Capital Improvement Program
      The capital improvement program (CIP) represents the City's short-range
      strategic capital investment. The CIP identifies and provides two types of
      expenditures: strategic improvements to the City's existing infrastructure and
      one-time projects designed to address important community needs.
      At the municipal level, capital projects include local streets, streetscapes,
      sidewalks and medians, signs, traffic control devices, street lighting, utility
      boxes, and local public art projects. Local bus stops, bicycle racks, and transit
      stations are other capital projects. These projects are usually funded by a
      general fund or, in some cases, gas taxes.
      Community facilities can also be CIP projects and can include public buildings
      such as civic centers, schools, libraries, museums, police and fire departments,
      courthouses, jails, parks, recreation facilities, pools, and tennis courts.
4-14 City of Westminster General Plan | Community Design

Community facilities may also include quasi-public buildings like concert
halls, convention centers, and hospitals. Quasi-public facilities are financed
with local government support but are usually owned and operated by the
private or nonprofit sector and may have their own revenue streams.
The zoning and municipal codes and the City’s CIP are essential tools for
placemaking within communities and regulating development so that it
meets the community’s expectations for attractive design, building quality,
and sustainable development.
Assessment District
An Assessment District can be created to finance new public improvements
or other additions to the community, such as enhanced landscaping, street
furniture, signs, lighting or other enhancements, funded by a special property
tax. Assessment Districts can be created by a local agency, such as a City or a
County, in collaboration with property owners who want the improvement(s).
The district would include all properties that will directly benefit from the
improvement(s). The assessment is based on mathematical formulas that take
into account how much each property will benefit from the improvement(s).
National Historic Preservation Act
The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 coordinates public and private
efforts to identify, evaluate, and protect the nation’s historic and
archaeological resources. The act authorized the National Register of Historic
Places, which lists districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that are
significant in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, and
culture.
Section 106 (Protection of Historic Properties) of the National Historic
Preservation Act requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of
their undertakings on historic properties. Section 106 Review ensures that
historic properties are considered during federal project planning and
implementation. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, an
independent federal agency, administers the review process with assistance
from state historic preservation offices.

and achieving other community goals such as expanded transit service and
pedestrian mobility.
As articulated in its Vision Statement laid out in the Introduction, Westminster
believes in the importance of a comprehensive and well-connected mobility
network to support existing development and future growth. The Mobility
Element generally focuses on the connectivity of the city’s transportation
system and supports the other elements within the General Plan, especially
the Land Use Element, with which it has the strongest relationship. It provides
the framework for multimodal linkages to the City’s activity centers and key
destinations in an effort to minimize vehicular trips and create a more
walkable environment, especially along the community’s key corridors. The
goals and policies in this element also highlight the ability to connect people
via active transportation (walking, biking, transit) to the City’s six mixed-use
areas. Special attention has also been paid to connecting to regional
transportation facilities to ensure the mobility needs of people living,
working, and visiting Westminster are well-served as a user moves outside of
the City boundary. The element also relates to local economic development
and placemaking (as described in the Community Design Element), by
defining new street typologies which focus on the users and adjacent land
uses and landscaping to make the mobility environment for all users safer and
                                                                                   In 2016, the City hosted an event called

California state law requires that a general plan include “the general location

                                               circulation elements, as described in the Government Code, except that the

                                               Following a brief overview of Westminster’s existing transportation system,
                                               the goals and policies of this element are organized around four topics:
                                               »    Complete Streets. Describes how Westminster’s streets provide a safe,

                                               The following sections provide content for each topic addressed in this
                                               element, followed by goals and policies to achieve the General Plan vision for
                                               mobility in Westminster. Related plans, programs, and legislation are
                                               discussed at the end of the element.

                                               Much of Westminster’s transportation system has developed within the last
                                               50 years, in a time where transportation was largely influenced by freeway
                                               expansions and an interest and desire to travel by personal vehicles. The
                                               automobile-focused transportation system envisioned in the City’s previous
                                               general plans has largely been realized. However, in recent years, the City has
                                               been taking steps to support complete street principles. This includes
                                               comprehensive planning efforts—the Moran Street Specific Plan and the
                                               City’s Active Transportation Plan—which support complete streets and
                                               mobility for all users, of all ages and abilities.

                                               demographics also influence the city’s mobility system. People are expected
                                               to live longer, increasing the need for transportation options that serve the
                                               population as they age. Additionally, younger people, having grown up
                                               through one of the worst recessions in recent history, are more interested in
                                               traveling by bicycle, transit, or walking than previous generations. This
                                               element responds to these regulatory and demographic changes by shifting
                                               the City’s focus to developing a long-term multimodal strategy for users of all
                                               ages and abilities. The existing transportation system is described below.

Streets
The city accommodates motorists via its system of freeways, regional streets
and local streets. California Department of Transportations’ (Caltrans)
operated and maintained facilities include Interstate-405 (I-405), State Route
22 (SR-22), and Beach Boulevard (SR-39). North/south streets are generally
provided on a ½-mile to 1-mile grid system. These key roadways include Bolsa
Chica Road, Edwards Street, Goldenwest Street, Hoover Street, Newland
Street, Magnolia Street, Bushard Street, Brookhurst Street, and Ward Street.
East/west streets are also generally provided on a ½-mile to 1-mile grid
system. The key east/west streets include Trask Avenue, Westminster
Boulevard, Hazard Avenue, Bolsa Avenue, McFadden Avenue, and Edinger
Avenue.                                                                               Local streets are places where

such facilities as parallel bike lanes, trails, and/or sidewalks (excluding along
freeways where pedestrians and bicyclists are prohibited).
The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) has also identified key
roadways in the City as critical components to the regional infrastructure. This
includes facilities that have been identified by OCTA as part of the regional
Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH) for vehicle movement, as part of the
OCTA Congestion Management Program (CMP) facilities, and as part of the
OCTA Commuter Bikeways Strategic Plan, and the OCTA Districts 1 and 2
Bikeways Strategy.. Most of the facilities described above are designated
MPAH facilities. CMP facilities in the City of Westminster include Beach
Boulevard (SR-39), Bolsa Chica Road, and Bolsa Avenue. The regional bikeway
plan identifies bicycle facilities on Springdale Street, Hazard Avenue, Hoover
Street, and Ward Avenue.
 Clean, well-maintained streets with mature landscaping create an attractive image of
 the community.

                                            Walking is an environmentally friendly mode of transportation that enhances
                                            both personal and social wellbeing. This mode of travel also provides many
                                            public access, health and economic benefits. Well-designed pedestrian

                                            In addition to meeting some of the community’s transportation needs,
                                            bicycling provides many improved access to public amenities, and several
                                            health and economic benefits. Bicycling could be recognized as an integral
                                            component of Westminster’s transportation system, currently and in the
                                            future. Safe, convenient, attractive, and well-designed bicycle facilities are
                                            essential if this mode is to be properly accommodated and encouraged. This
                                            mode could be integrated throughout the City’s Complete Streets vision, and
                                            a network of bicycle facilities linking all areas of the City could be
                                            accommodated.
                                            The existing bicycle system in the City of Westminster mainly consists of a
                                            limited number of Class II striped bicycle lanes across the City, as well as Class
                                            III signed bike routes along Trask Avenue and Hoover Street. Some bikeways
                                            are also incomplete and end abruptly. There are many opportunities to
                                            improve the quantity and quality of bicycle facilities and the connectivity to
                                            key destinations (employment centers, residential areas, and high use activity

Goods Movement
The goods or freight movement system in Westminster is crucial to the well-
being of the residents of the City due to its importance for a healthy and vital
local economy. Identifying and prioritizing facilities for goods movement is a
vital portion of effective planning that can balance economic needs and the
needs of other modes of transportation.
Facilities that prioritize goods movement over other modes of transportation
must be integrated into the transportation system to ensure efficient delivery.
The Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) of 1982 defines state truck
routes and key freight corridors. Regional access to Westminster is
accommodated by STAA designated I-405 and SR-22 and Beach Boulevard
(SR-39). Also, Westminster Boulevard, Bolsa Avenue, Goldenwest Street, and
Magnolia Street are designated as truck routes.
A single rail line for freight runs parallel to Hoover Street (in a north/south
orientation). It runs once a day in the morning, three to four days a week. The
freight line provides access to a wholesale lumber yard south of the city limits
and is owned by Union Pacific.

                                           Complete Streets
                                           A complete streets vision is more than implementation of a state-mandated
                                           approach during a general plan update process. It is a fundamental shift in
                                           how the city will plan and design the street system – recognizing the street as
                                           a public space and ensuring that the public space serves all users of the
                                           system (elderly, children, bicycles, pedestrians, etc.) within the urban context
     As is typical for many cities in
                                           of that system (e.g. accounting for the adjacent land uses).

  Westminster’s land is dedicated          The Mobility Element is consistent with and further enhances the state and
    to roadways. This means that           federal requirements for complete streets by implementing a “complete streets”
       streets are not only a major        strategy. Complete streets recognize that each street within the city is unique
                                           given its geographic setting, adjacent land uses, and the desired use of that
              resource for the City’s
                                           facility. As such, this element identifies a street typology appropriate for the
       circulation, but also greatly
                                           uniqueness of the street and surrounding land uses and identifies which modes

                    the community.
                                           While many transportation projects have historically been vehicle capacity
                                           enhancing and traffic control focused, this Mobility Element supports a new
                                           paradigm to evaluate each project and explore all potential solutions to
                                           enhance the mobility for all users of the street. Many of these projects will
                                           involve repurposing existing right-of-way rather than acquiring and
                                           constructing new right-of-way.
                                           The City’s approach to provide complete streets recognizes that optimum
                                           service levels cannot be provided for all travel modes on all streets within the
                                           city. This is due to competing interests that arise when different travel modes
                                           mix. For example, pedestrian friendly streets typically have slow vehicle travel
                                           speeds, short-distance pedestrian crossings, and include some type of buffer
                                           between the vehicle travel way and the pedestrian walkway. However,
                                           automobile friendly streets typically have wide travel lanes, multiple turn lanes
                                           (increasing the pedestrian crossing distance), and high automobile speeds.
 Westminster supports a complete-streets
          approach to roadway planning.
                                             As identified in the photo above, many different mobility users come together along
                                             Westminster’s street. Above, an OCTA bus, a rail line, and auto drivers move through an

Layered Networks Approach
“Layered networks” is an approach to mobility planning which recognizes
that not all streets can provide great service levels for all modes of travel. For
example, the best streets to drive on tend to be large, fast, with limited
interruptions. Whereas the best streets to walk on tend to have slow vehicles,
that are narrow, with buffering from the vehicle travel way. As such, layered
networks recognizes that a network of streets that prioritize specific travel
modes can provide a comprehensive and appropriate system within a city.
This Mobility Element identifies utilizes a layered networks approach to ensure
complete streets. This approach identifies preferred travel modes (auto,
pedestrian, bicycle, and/or transit) for each street typology. Non-preferred
travel modes are accommodated along the street, but their service is not
prioritized. It is understood that the priorities of some of these streets may shift
10 to 20 years into the future. If the desire for transit or other active modes of
transportation increases, more streets could move from auto-prioritized to
prioritizing other modes. The City should monitor changing community desires
and consider updates/amendments to the General Plan Mobility Element to
reflect future changes in priority.
Figure 5-1 depicts the City’s layered network complete street system and
identifies the City’s complete streets strategy for prioritizing modes based on
                                                                                     Specific streets have been identified for
street typology; a street network that prioritizes pedestrians and bicycles is       pedestrian and bicycle priority use.
shown on Figure 5-2, Figure 5-3 shows the network of streets where
automotive travel is prioritized, and a network of streets that prioritize transit
is shown on Figure 5-4. As shown on the maps, it is this network of priority
modes that provides a comprehensive mobility system within the City. This
approach also ensures that connectivity for that mode is maintained to
ensure mobility throughout the City. Figure 5-5 provides additional detail for
each roadway typology identified in the City’s layered network complete
street system, including definitions, an example cross section and photo, and
information on priority modes of travel. Exact street dimensions are not
identified in the Mobility Element, rather, they will be adopted separately by
resolution.

      Multi-Modal Levels of Service (LOS)
      Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative description of traffic flow based on several
      factors, such as speed, travel time, delay, and freedom to maneuver. Six levels are
      typically defined, ranging from LOS “A”, representing completely free-flow
      conditions, to LOS “F”, representing breakdown in flow resulting in stop-and-go
      conditions. LOS “E” represents operations at or near capacity, an unstable level
      where vehicles are operating with the minimum spacing for maintaining
      uniform flow.
      Traditionally, transportation systems have been designed to achieve a level of
      service (LOS) from the perspective of the driver, not pedestrians or bicyclists.
      However, by the mid-2010s, cities throughout the country have designed their
      transportation systems to achieve levels of service for all travel modes. Some
      cities, such as Fort Collins, CO, San Francisco, CA, Gainesville, FL, Carlsbad, CA,
      Charlotte, NC, and others, have been doing this since the early 2000s; and in
      2010, national guidelines were developed by the Transportation Research
      Board to encourage other cities to establish levels of service for all travel modes.
      The California Complete Streets Act (2008) requires cities in California to plan
      for a balanced, multi-modal transportation system that meets the needs of all
      travel modes. Ideally, a comprehensive multi-modal level of service (MMLOS)
      methodology would be available to reflect the quality of the transportation
      system. However, MMLOS is still emerging at the national level and should be
      monitored for potential integration into the future.
      Although LOS will continue to be used as a metric in the City of Westminster to
      show consistency with this General Plan on auto-priority streets, the City will
      need to monitor SB 743 and update the City’s significance criteria to identify
      appropriate VMT thresholds for identifying impacts to the transportation
      system.
      Future Operations and Street Improvements
      Most of the envisioned Westminster street system is built out. The only
      planned new connections include three bicycle/pedestrian corridors that are
      identified on Figures 5-1 and 5-2. These new connections include the Bolsa
      Chica Creek Channel, the East Garden Grove Wintersburg Channel, and the
      extension of a facility under I-405 along the Hoover Street Alignment.
      In addition to the connectivity described above, the Mobility Element does
      promote reuse of the existing roadway width or minor expansion existing
      right-of-way (ROW) to accommodate a more complete street. This includes
      the designation of several multi-way boulevards and the implementation of
      other complete streets elements in the City, such as the Garden Grove
      Boulevard Cycle Track. The City has recently implemented a citywide traffic
      signal system upgrade effort. This effort included retiming of traffic signals,
      upgrading the controller and detection technology, and integration of the
      traffic control system to a single point traffic management center. This
      enables the city to monitor, manage, and adjust traffic signal timing along
      major corridors to improve mobility and manage vehicle flow within the city.
      Improved traffic signal timing also enhances the safety for drivers, improves
      air quality by reducing emissions and brake dust, and improves commute
      times.
      In 2015, the Orange County Council of Governments (OCCOG) also developed
      the Orange County Complete Streets Initiative (OCCSI) Design Handbook,
      which defines roadway typologies throughout Orange County. The
      Handbook illustrates both existing and recommended typologies, and
      recommended design principles and considerations for each roadway type.

Finally, OCTA manages the Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH) for
Orange County. This document specifically identifies streets in the County
that are critical to the movement of vehicles in the County. This mobility
element aims to provide maximum balance to provide mobility for all users of
all ages and abilities while maintaining consistency with the County’s MPAH.
Future Traffic Operations
With build-out of the Land Use Element, the completed street network
presented on Figure 5-1 will have capacity constraints on arterial streets and
on freeways within and adjacent to the city. The analysis of the Land Use Plan
indicated that the following facilities will operate unacceptably based on
policy M-1.3 in the city at build-out and will require additional improvements
to operate acceptably, as described below.
Bolsa Chica Road & Westminster Boulevard (City of Westminster).
Improvement: Add an eastbound right-turn overlap phase.
Garden Grove Boulevard & Western Avenue (City of Westminster).
Improvement: Optimize the signal timing for anticipated traffic demand.
Westminster Boulevard & Magnolia Avenue (City of Westminster).
Improvement: Optimize the coordinated PM signal timing for anticipated traffic
volume demand.
Garden Grove Boulevard & Goldenwest Street (Caltrans). Improvements:
Modify the eastbound approach from having one left turn lane, one shared
through-left turn lane, one through lane, and one right turn lane, to having two
left turn lanes, three through lanes, and one right turn lane.
Garden Grove Boulevard & SR 22 Westbound Off-Ramp/Eagle Drive
(Caltrans). Improvement: Optimize the signal timing for anticipated traffic
demand.
Bolsa Avenue & Newland Street (County of Orange). Improvements: Add an
eastbound and westbound through lane through restriping and minor roadway
widening.
Edinger Avenue & Newland Street (City of Huntington Beach).
Improvement: Add an eastbound and westbound through lane through
restriping.

       POLICIES
       M-1.1         Priority Travel Modes. Develop a comprehensive network of
                     complete streets throughout the City, to provide connectivity for
                     priority modes of travel based on the prioritized modes
                     identified on Figure 5-1.
       M-1.2         Agency Coordination. Coordinate with Caltrans, OCTA, and
                     SCAG to implement complete streets and maintain consistency
                     with the Orange County Master Plan of Arterial Highways, the
                     Congestion Management Program, and the Regional
                     Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy.
       M-1.3         Level of Service. Maintain level of service (LOS) D for vehicles at
                     intersections and roadways when vehicles are considered a
                     prioritized mode of travel (see Figure 5-1). When vehicles are not
                     prioritized, LOS E for vehicles at intersections and roadways
                     (operating at capacity) shall be acceptable.
       M-1.4         Multi-modal Level of Service. Monitor SB 743 and multi-modal
                     level of service (MMLOS) methodologies and incorporate into
                     impact assessment as appropriate. When and if these
                     methodologies are applied in Westminster, LOS D for all
                     prioritized vehicle modes of travel should be maintained and
                     LOS E should be maintained for vehicles when identified as a
                     non-prioritized mode of travel.
       M-1.5         Mobility Impacts. Evaluate potential mobility impacts
                     associated with proposed new developments and require the
                     implementation of appropriate mitigation measures.
       M-1.6         Funding. Pursue funding for multi-modal infrastructure projects
                     that promote complete streets, such as impact fees and local,
                     regional, state, and federal grants.
       M-1.7         Future Improvements. Obtain and preserve adequate right-of-
                     way to accommodate future mobility system improvements.
       M-1.8         Residential Streets. Design residential streets to minimize traffic
                     volumes and/or speed, as appropriate, without compromising
                     connectivity for emergency first responders, bicycles, and
                     pedestrians. This could be accomplished through management
                     and implementation of complete street strategies, short block
                     lengths, narrow streets, and/or traffic calming measures.
       M-1.9         Traffic Calming Tools. Use traffic-calming tools to assist in
                     implementing complete street principles; possible tools include
                     roundabouts, curb extensions, high visibility crosswalks, and
                     separated bicycle infrastructure.
       M-1.10        Truck Routes. Designate truck routes to allow the safe and
                     efficient movement of goods for commerce and industry,
                     minimize conflicts with preferred modes, and minimize
                     incompatibility with other sensitive land uses in the City
                     including residential neighborhoods.

Active Transportation
A balanced transportation system in Westminster will provide adequate
facilities for people to bicycle, walk, or take transit to their destinations. To
achieve this balanced transportation system, a layered networks approach to
travel has been developed.
The City of Westminster is preparing an active transportation plan (ATP) that
articulates the community’s vision for developing and improving pedestrian
and bicycle facilities within the City. Once adopted, this Plan will supersede
the City’s existing Bike and Pedestrian Master Plans. Specifically, the plan will
be used as a vehicle for pursuing local, state, and federal funding to
implement new active transportation connections in Westminster. The ATP
carries forward the goals and policies identified in the Mobility element by
identifying specific strategies to address future bicycle and pedestrian needs
in the City, in addition to the implementation actions identified in this
General Plan.
Over time, the City envisions robust bicycle connectivity around Westminster
through creation of an “east loop” (serving the neighborhoods generally east
of Beach Boulevard) and “west loop” (serving the neighborhoods generally
west of Beach Boulevard); the loops would come together at or near the Civic
Center. Together, these loops would help link people to places throughout
Westminster using active transportation facilities.
In addition to the planned pedestrian and bicycle facilities, the ATP outlines
new educational and promotional programs aimed at pedestrians, bicyclists,
and motorists. These programs include bicycle parking improvements, multi-
modal (transit) support facilities, bicycle safety and education programs for
cyclists and motorists, safe routes to schools programs, community and
employer outreach programs, continued development of bikeway network
maps, and bike-to-work and school day events, among others.                          On- and off-street bicycle facilities are
                                                                                     envisioned to connect residents to

                                      Proposed Bicycle Network
                                      Westminster acknowledges that a comprehensive, safe, and well-maintained
                                      bikeway network with supporting facilities has multiple benefits. It can help
                                      to increase the mode share for bicycling. Reducing the number of short
                                      vehicle trips by shifting those trips to bicycling helps improve circulation and
                                      reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and contributes to a healthier lifestyle. A
                                      comprehensive bicycle network can also promote intermodal connectivity to
                                      transit.

                                      Bicycle Facility Classification System
                                      Caltrans has defined four bikeway facility types. Three are presented in
                                      Chapter 1000 of the Highway Design Manual while the fourth is in the process
                                      of being implemented into the Highway Design Manual. These facility types
                                      are described below, presented in Figure 5.3, Bikeway Classifications, and will
                                      be discussed in further detail in the City’s Active Transportation Plan.
                                      Class I Bike Path. Provides a separated corridor that is not served by streets
                                      and highways and is away from the influence of parallel streets. Class I
                                      bikeways are for non-vehicle use only with opportunities for direct access and
                                      recreational benefits, right-of-way for the exclusive use of bicycles and
                                      pedestrians, and cross flow conflicts are minimized.
                                      Class II Bike Lane. Provides a delineated right-of-way assigned to bicyclists to
                                      enable more predictable movements, establishing specific lines of
                                      demarcation between areas reserved for bicycles and lanes to be occupied by
                                      motor vehicles.
                                      Class III Bike Route. Shared facility that serves either continuity to other
                                      bicycle facilities or designates preferred routes through high demand
                                      corridors.
                                      Class IV Separated Bikeway or Cycle Track. Provides delineated right-of-way
                                      assigned to bicyclists that have a physical separation between them and a
                                      vehicle. This separation can include parked vehicles, bollards, curbs, or any other
                                      physical devise that provides this separation. This “new” bicycle classification
                                      was defined in AB 1193 and amended the streets and highways code to allow for
                                      this treatment. Additionally, Caltrans issued Design Information Bulletin 89 (DIB-
                                      89) which establishes design guidance for Class IV facilities.
                                      In addition to the four facility types described above, a number of local streets
                                      help complete the bicycle network. These streets typically do not have a
                                      bikeway designation; however, the entire street systems may be fully
                                      adequate for safe and efficient bicycle travel, where signing and pavement
                                      marking for bicycle use may be unnecessary. These are most commonly
                                      found along local streets where vehicle speeds are relatively low, which
                                      enables bicycle travel to be accommodated with vehicle travel.

Proposed Transit Network
Although the basic regional transit backbone infrastructure has been
implemented within the city (discussed earlier in this section), one of the biggest
deterrents to transit use is the “first mile/last mile” portion of the transit trip, which
refers to the method and ability for transit users to actually connect to their
ultimate destination once they get off of the primary transit mode. This concept is
also referred to as “door-to-door” transit service, which addresses transit in a more
comprehensive manner than “stop-to-stop.” This Mobility element promotes the
improvement of the “first mile/last mile”/“door-to-door” transit service through
development incentives that incorporate and encourage shuttles and other
connectivity to and from the transit infrastructure system. Opportunities exist for
new local circulators that could link the city; key destinations include Little Saigon,
Westminster Mall, Downtown, and the Civic Center. Additionally, improved
bicycle facilities can also help close the first mile/last mile gap, as described in the
previous section on bicycle facilities. The Westminster community has public bus,
express bus service, paratransit, and vanpooling options available to them. These
four services are described in detail below.
Public Bus                                                                                 OCTA bus service connects Westminster
Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) currently offers 66 routes                   to the region.
county-wide throughout the week. These routes have set schedules offering
service throughout the day to multiple communities. Existing bus routes serving
Westminster include Route 25 (serving trips between Fullerton and Huntington
Beach), Route 29 (serving trips between La Habra and Huntington Beach), Route
33 (serving trips between Fullerton and Huntington Beach), Route 60 (serving
trips between Long Beach and Tustin),Route 64 (serving trips between
Huntington Beach and Tustin), and Bravo! Route 560 (serving trips between
Long Beach and Santa Ana). This Mobility Element strives to enhance this service
to provide better mobility for the City’s residences by providing better linkages
for bicycles and pedestrians to bus stations in the City.
Paratransit
A demand-based door-to-door service available primarily for Senior and
Disabled passengers at a discounted rate, but can be expanded to all passengers
at a premium rate. OCTA currently operates its ACCESS shared-ride service for
passengers meeting the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) eligibility criteria.
Express Bus Service
Bus service that is intended to run faster than normal bus services between the
same two commuter points. Express buses operate on a faster schedule by not
making as many stops as normal bus services and often taking quicker routes,
such as along freeways. Westminster residents are currently served by two OCTA
express bus routes: Route 211 (serving trips between Seal Beach and Irvine) and
Route 701 (serving trips between Huntington Beach and Los Angeles.
Vanpooling
Larger scale carpooling with concurrent savings in fuel and vehicle operating
costs. Vehicles may be provided by individuals, by various public and private
support programs, by an element of government, or a by an employer. The
key concept is that people share the ride from home or a common meeting
location and travel together to a common destination or work center.
Westminster residents have the option of signing up for existing vanpools or
starting new ones through OCTA’s website.

Parking
Parking is important to the success of any area. Inadequate parking means
that businesses and residents suffer. Too much parking underutilizes valuable
land; promotes lower density development; discourages using other forms of
transportation (such as public transit); spreads out land uses, thereby
reinforcing the use of the automobile. Additionally, too much parking also
requires more driveways for site access, introducing conflicts between
pedestrians and vehicles. Inflexible parking requirements impact the ability to
rejuvenate/repurpose older buildings and revitalize activity centers that can
be better served and connected by enhancing facilities and amenities for
bicyclists and pedestrians. Therefore, it is important to “right size” and       In Westminster’s mixed-use areas and at

around.
The City’s Municipal Code provides standards for parking facilities based on
land use type within the City. The Code also identifies bicycle parking
requirements and allows parking reductions due to transit proximity and
shared parking between land uses. The City should expand opportunities that
promote “right sizing” of parking facilities, by applying the following
techniques:
Park once. A strategy in destination districts to enable visitors to “park once”
and visit a series of destinations. Park once strategies work well in areas like
the Civic Center, Downtown, and Little Saigon areas that are well connected
by pedestrian and bicycle facilities. The creation of well-signed centralized
parking areas supports this strategy.
Shared parking. Continue to allow uses that have different parking demands
at different times of the day to share the same parking facilities. This is an
effective way to minimize pavement, allow denser land use, provide for more
landscaping, and provide improved walkability within a mixed use area. The
best example of shared parking is an office building and an apartment
building as office’s peak parking demand occurs at 10:00 a.m. and
apartment’s peak parking demand occurs at 11:00 p.m.
Unbundled parking. Rather than provide free guaranteed parking,
“unbundle” the parking from the development and require residents and/or
employees to pay for use of a parking space. Renting or selling parking spaces
separately, rather than automatically including them with building space is
not only more equitable, but can also reduce the total amount of parking
required for the building.
In-lieu parking fees. Develop strategies in appropriate areas that allow
developers to contribute fees toward the development of a common parking
facility in lieu of providing on-site parking. This works best in concentrated
commercial areas, and assists in paying for unified structured parking and
provides developers an opportunity to increase density on their parcels.
Parking management strategies. Allow business districts or businesses to
manage high demand parking locations and destinations through a number
of different strategies including demand pricing, time restrictions, valet
parking, and other techniques.
                                   City of Westminster General Plan | Mobility                                        5-35

       Private partnerships. The city, business owners, and developers collaborate
       to provide both private and public parking opportunities. Instances where
       this works well include parcels owned by the City, or private underutilized
       parking lots where a private entity develops, manages, and enforces parking
       in these public lots.
       Parking locater signs. Electronic monitoring devices that identify the
       available parking in a given facility and utilize changeable message signs to
       assist travelers in identifying available parking locations. This may require
       modifications to the City’s Zoning Ordinance to be implemented in some
       areas of the city.
       Reduced parking standards. Reduce parking standards in areas that are well
       served by transit, provide shuttle accessibility, provide parking cash out
       programs (employers pay employees to not drive a single occupancy vehicle
       to work), or provide other programs that will reduce parking demand.
       Biking equals business program/ Bicycle corrals in-lieu of vehicle
       parking. Businesses in certain districts provide bicycle parking or corrals and
       provide incentives to encourage their patrons and employees to ride rather
       than drive. In some cases, they may reduce required onsite parking for
       vehicles if they provide a corral that accommodates more people
       Transit equals business program. Businesses provide their customers and
       employees incentives to encourage them to use transit rather than drive.
       Although there are additional parking strategies that are available and may
       become available in the future, most of the strategies work best in smart
       growth/mixed use development areas and will be necessary to accomplish
       the goals and visions identified in the General Plan and this Mobility Element.
       GOAL M-4:          PARKING
       Adequate availability of parking that meets the needs of people who
       live, work, and visit Westminster.
       POLICIES
       M-4.1         Off-Street Parking. Require new developments to provide
                     sufficient off-street parking to reduce on-street parking
                     congestion and increase both auto and pedestrian safety, and
                     encourage new development to provide electric vehicle
                     charging stations and preferential parking for carpools,
                     vanpools, and alternative fuel vehicles.
       M-4.2         Off-Street Parking Alternatives. Allow developers to meet
                     their minimum parking requirements via shared parking
                     techniques which can leverage unused parking with nearby
                     parcels, in-lieu fees, or on-street parking.
       M-4.3         Managed Parking Supply. Manage parking supply through
                     implementation of time limits, pay parking, or permits, while
                     ensuring the preservation of economic development goals.
       M-4.4         Funding for Parking. Pursue the development of additional
                     parking facilities in high-demand areas such as Little Saigon and
                     park and recreation facilities.

Transportation Management
This Mobility Element also supports and promotes Transportation Demand
Management (TDM) and transportation systems management (TSM)
techniques.
Demand Management
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) consists of programs and
policies to reduce the demand for the single occupant automobile. Common
techniques include carpool programs, car-sharing and bike-sharing programs,
flexible work hours, telecommute provisions, shuttle services to nearby transit
stations, employee transit subsidies (e.g. employers will subsidize bus or rail
tickets), installation of bicycle facilities (lockers, racks, lanes, showers at
employment areas, etc.), or other measures that would reduce the demand to
drive. TDM is critical for the city to build-out without expanding the
transportation infrastructure beyond what is envisioned in this Mobility
Element. Additionally, as previously described, TDM is a major component in
improving the effectiveness of transit as it can assist in serving the “first
mile/last mile” component of a transit trip.
One key component to improving transit use is improving the “first mile/last
mile” experience for transit users. This typically includes end of trip facilities
(bike lockers and racks, showers, changing rooms, etc.) and better
connectivity from the transit stop to the ultimate destination via bicycle
facilities, pedestrian facilities, local transit circulators, shuttles, etc.
Westminster’s future transit effectiveness will be dependent on major
employers assisting with providing some of these “first mile/last mile”
facilities through transportation demand management (TDM) measures. TDM
is envisioned to include potential shuttle circulators from transit stations to
major employers and destinations, showers and changing rooms at those
locations, and a host of other typical TDM techniques that would support
transit usage and the connection to the ultimate destination. This Mobility
Element also supports TDM through potential incentives (such as reduced
                                                                                   Dedicated carpool parking spaces and
parking standards for TDM implementation) to further support transit access
                                                                                   the promotion of ride-share programs
to these destinations (NCHRP Report 548-A).                                        can help manage the demand for single
                                                                                   occupant automobiles.
Transportation Systems Management
The City has also implemented a state-of-the-practice Transportation System
Management (TSM) system. This system integrates traffic signals in the city to
a single access point, allowing city staff to monitor and update signal timings
to improve safety and mobility for all users in the city. This Mobility Element
supports further implementation of this program and use of other
technologies that become available, which have the ability to improve
mobility for all users of the city’s transportation system. TSM measures
include, but are not limited to: improving design standards (e.g. adjusting
design standards to reduce pedestrian crossing distances to promote
pedestrian use while allocating more green time toward high demand vehicle
movements), upgrading and coordination of traffic control devices, intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) (e.g. “smart” systems that manage the system
better, such as signal coordination, driver information signs, or other
technologies that allow more efficient use of the transportation system),
controlling on-street parking, and use of sophisticated electronic control
methods to supervise the flow of traffic.

                     ensure that the City's circulation system is as efficient and cost
                     effective as possible and reflect the desire of the City to
                     implement improved pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
       Related Plans, Programs, and Legislation
       The Mobility element supports and implements several state and local laws
       and plans.
       Assembly Bill (AB) 32
       The Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) of 2006 was signed into law on
       September 27, 2006. This was a state commitment to reduce greenhouse gas
       emissions (GHG) statewide with specific reduction targets identified in the
       state law. This bill requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to
       develop regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by
       2020. On January 1, 2012 the greenhouse gas rules and market mechanisms
       adopted by CARB took effect. CARB recognizes cities as “essential partners” in
       reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The City of Westminster will, like many
       other cities, voluntarily strive to comply with AB 32 and implement
       greenhouse gas reduction strategies. ARB has developed a Local Government
       Toolkit with guidance for GHG reduction strategies such as improving transit,
       developing bicycle/pedestrian infrastructure (new facilities, linkages, lanes,
       etc.), increasing city fleet vehicle efficiency, and other strategies.
       Implementing these strategies can help facilitate a reduction in vehicle miles
       traveled (VMT) by providing realistic alternatives to automobile trips, thereby
       resulting in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.
       Senate Bill (SB) 375
       The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act (SB 375) of 2008, also
       known as the California Anti-Sprawl Bill, was signed into law on September 30,
       2008. The SB 375 regulation provides incentives for cities and developers to
       bring housing and jobs closer together and to improve public transit. The goal
       behind SB 375 is to reduce automobile commuting trips and thus help meet the
       statewide targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions set by AB 32. The
       legislation required Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to look at the
       interface between land use and transportation; it also requires MPOs to develop
       strategies to reduce vehicle miles of travel (VMT), which is a precursor to
       greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).
5-38 City of Westminster General Plan | Mobility

Senate Bill (SB) 743
SB 743 was signed into law on September 27, 2013. This legislation directed
the State Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to identify an alternative
metric (other than automobile level of service (LOS) to be used for identifying
transportation impacts as part of CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act).
The purpose of SB 743 is to balance the needs of congestion management,
infill development, public health, greenhouse gas reductions, and other goals.
OPR has developed a set of draft guidelines to implement SB 743 and have
identified vehicles miles of travel (VMT) as the most appropriate metric for
CEQA assessment which would replace level of service. Once the guidelines
are approved by the Natural Resources Agency (likely late in 2016) the City of
Westminster will have two years to update their CEQA guidelines to develop
significance criteria consistent with the intent of SB 743 (e.g. a VMT
transportation metric).
Assembly Bill (AB) 1358 (California Complete Streets Act)
In 2008, the State of California passed Assembly Bill (AB) 1358, the California
Complete Streets Act. This bill requires that all circulation elements
developed after January 1, 2011 include a complete streets approach that
balances the needs of all users of the street, including motorists, pedestrians,
bicycles, children, persons with disabilities, seniors, movers of commercial
goods, and users of public transportation. This Mobility Element focuses on
the need to provide complete streets throughout the community and is the
core focus of this element.
County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH)
The County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH) forms part of
the Orange County General Plan and designates the arterial system in the
Mobility Element of the General Plan. Defined according to specific arterial
functional classifications, the MPAH serves to define the intended future
roadway system for the County. Cities within the County are expected to
achieve consistency with the MPAH in individual General Plan circulation
elements. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) does tie some
local funding to MPAH consistency; as such, it is important to maintain
consistency with the MPAH. If changes to the MPAH are contemplated by a
local agency, OCTA does have a process to undertake to complete assessment
and obtain approval from OCTA.
Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA)
The Orange County Transportation Authority is the public sector
transportation planning body and mass transit service provider for Orange
County, CA. The OCTA is responsible for overseeing and operating 77 bus
lines, the Countywide Master Highway Plan, and a proposed streetcar line
(the OC Streetcar).
Measure M
Measure M (voted into effect in1990) authorized a half-cent retail sales tax
increase for the duration of 20 years throughout Orange County to generate
revenue to use on local and regional transportation improvements and
maintenance projects. Although Measure M expired in 2011, a November
2006 ballot measure renewed the program (now known as M2) through 2031.
M2 extends the requirements of Measure M, without increasing sales taxes, to
fund freeway, street, transit, and environmental projects identified in a
                                  City of Westminster General Plan | Mobility    5-39

       renewal measure.
       Most M2 project have already been programed by OCTA, who administers the
       program. These projects are all reflected in the Regional Transportation Plan
       and are consistent with this Mobility Element.
       Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
       Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and Sustainable
       Communities Strategy (SCS)
       The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is a long-range transportation plan
       developed and updated by SCAG every four years. The RTP identifies regional
       transportation strategies to address regional mobility needs using growth
       forecasts and economic projections over a 20-year period. The Sustainable
       Communities Strategy (SCS) is a newly required element of the RTP which
       integrates land use and transportation strategies to achieve California Air
       Resources Board (CARB) emissions reduction targets. In May of 2016, the
       Regional Council of SCAG adopted the 2016-2040 RTP/SCS: A Plan for
       Mobility, Accessibility, Sustainability and a High Quality of Life. The 2016–
       2040 RTP/SCS provides a blueprint for improving quality of life for Southern
       California residents by providing more choices
       Transportation Impact Fees
       The Mobility Element influences the City’s Transportation Impact Fee (TIF).
       The TIF identifies the fair share future development will need to pay for
       improving transportation facilities to accommodate new users. The City will
       also need to seek funding to maintain, repair, or augment existing roadway
       facilities and, correspondingly, will need to ensure that the transportation
       facilities identified in this Mobility element are feasible from a funding
       perspective.

The Parks and Recreation element provides policy direction for the provision
of parks, recreational facilities, and community programs throughout the City.
The goals and policies defined in this element promote the maintenance and
development of a high quality parks and provision of recreational
programming that meets the physical, mental, and social needs of all
Westminster residents and their varying life stages and lifestyles.
Westminster’s Parks and Recreation element serves as the “open space”
element required by the California Government Code. The open space
element is required to ensure that “cities and counties recognize that open
space land is a limited and valuable resource which must be conserved
whenever possible” (California Government Code [CGC] § 65562[a]; see also
CGC §§ 65561 and 65302[e]). This Parks and Recreation element meets state
requirements for an open space element by providing policy direction for the
Westminster parks system and recreational program development. The goals
and policies emphasize the vital role parks and recreation programs play in
economic development, land use, housing, community health, infrastructure,
and transportation goals.
                                                                                   The Splash Pad at Sigler Park is one of

high costs associated with acquiring and converting land to parks,
Westminster will continue to explore ways to create new opportunities for
public gathering places and recreation facilities in nontraditional settings,
including through partnerships with schools and with the development
community. Looking forward, public-private spaces like plazas, courtyards,
pedestrian paseos, and outdoor dining will play an increasingly important
role in creating places where Westminster community members can come
together.
Neighborhood Parks
Westminster residents have access to a variety of neighborhood parks
distributed throughout the community. Neighborhood parks are typically less
than 3 acres in size and are intended to serve residents living within walking
distance to the park (generally one-half mile). These small-scale parks offer a
quiet retreat from everyday life to enjoy nature, walk pets, picnic, or enjoy a
stroll. Neighborhood parks also offer opportunities for children to enjoy a
playground or for youth and adults to enjoy active recreation. While the
majority of Westminster’s neighborhood parks are open to the public, some
small neighborhood parks are private. These private facilities are generally
provided as an amenity in a residential development and are intended to           Modern and well-maintained open
provide park space exclusively for residents of that development.                 spaces, like those found at the Civic

Westminster’s community parks are typically larger than 3 acres and feature
larger amenities, such as fields for soccer, baseball, and basketball.
Community parks also serve recreational programming needs by providing
outdoor education and/or meeting areas, and are often rented for special
events and organized sports programs. Community Parks in Westminster
include Westminster Park, Bolsa Chica Park, Sigler Park, and Liberty Park,
which includes a skate park, pictured below.

                                               School Facilities
                                               Local schools can play a pivotal role in serving local park needs through
                                               “joint-use” agreements between the school district(s) and the City. Joint-use is
                                               essentially the use of public school facilities for park, recreation, educational,
                                               and public services for community members afterschool hours. Joint use can
                                               cover more than playgrounds and sports fields they can also include libraries,
                                               gymnasiums, cultural and performing art centers, health clinics, and other
                                               facilities. Maximizing these opportunities will require commitment and
                                               leadership, both from the City and school districts, to work together to find
                                               creative solutions, develop and leverage funding resources, and forge
                                               agreements to achieve these goals.

                                               limited land resources and funding, this is one of the most significant

                                               Special Use Facilities
                                               Special-use park facilities are designed to address specific recreational needs
                                               in the community and typically include museums, cultural centers, historic
                                               monuments, and commercial recreation facilities, like the Hoover Golf Center.
                                               The Westminster Rose Center is a shining example of a special use facility in
                                               the City. Located in the heart of the community next to the Civic Center, the
                                               Rose Center features a 33,840 square-foot building which houses a 419-seat
                                               theater, banquet hall and connecting foyers that accommodate a variety of
                                               cultural and civic functions. An outdoor courtyard and a 600-foot-long entry
                                               plaza provide additional venues for functions. The center is also adjacent to
                                               Freedom Park, which houses a Vietnam War Memorial. Over 100,000 people
                                               are expected to use the facility annually, including local school districts,
                                               international and local performing artists, business people and social and
                                               cultural groups.
        The Hoover Golf Center provides
    residents an opportunity to practice
                          their golf skills.

Regional Facilities
Several other parks and recreational facilities within a walk, bike ride, or short
drive from Westminster offer repose and recreational opportunities beyond the
city border. Nearby facilities include Mile Square Regional Park in Fountain
Valley, beaches in Seal Beach and Huntington Beach, Garden Grove Park,
Huntington Beach Central Park, and El Dorado East Regional Park. Smaller park
facilities close to the Westminster border in surrounding communities include
Geer Park, Glen View Park, Clegg-Stacy Park, Edgar Park, and Vista View Park.
(This is important to note because, in some cases, the public park closest to a
Westminster residence may actually be in another city.)
Beyond that, the entire Orange County regional recreation inventory includes
60,000 acres of regional parks, trails, public beaches, harbors, historic sites,
and wilderness areas. Westminster residents are fortunate to have such a
range of recreation opportunities nearby, so that it is always an option to get
outdoors and connect with the local and regional community.

Planning for Future Park Needs
The City’s population is increasing and demographics are shifting. These
changes may require certain parks and facilities to be upgraded or
reprogrammed in order to meet the future recreational demands of the
community. Westminster parks are generally planned according to three
criteria: 1) the total quantity of park acreage; 2) the accessibility of parks to
homes; and 3) the amenities for different parks to meet community needs.
Location and Accessibility
The City’s park facilities are dispersed throughout the community, but
residential areas concentrated in the northwest and southeast corners of the
City could benefit the most from future (infill) park development. Because the
City is mostly built out, it will be imperative to incorporate infill and
alternative forms of open space development in order to meet the diverse
health and recreational needs of residents.
The City’s recreation areas are illustrated on Figure 6-2, Parks, Trails, and Open
Space Plan. This figure also identifies a quarter mile radius (generally
considered walking distance) around each public or private park provided as
part of planned residential communities. Areas not within a quarter mile of an
existing or proposed park should be targeted for new park locations when
sites and/or funding become available.
                                                                                   The Civic Center provides peaceful

facilities can be enjoyed by users of all ages and abilities, including children,
adults, seniors, and disabled people. Accessible parks should have well-
designed facilities that are readily usable by those with disabilities,
connecting sidewalks that are an appropriate width and not along major
arterials, and transit options available for residents not living within walking
distance of park facilities. The Circulation element defines the pedestrian
network that connects park and recreational facilities to other activity hubs in
Westminster, including residences, schools, and commercial centers.
Changing Demographics and Preferences
Parks and recreational facilities should have amenities that serve the needs of
its changing population. Looking toward the future, Westminster’s
demographics are expected to stay generally consistent, with a consistently
high percentage of families with children. This means that the need will
remain high for smaller neighborhood parks that are equipped with tot lots,
playground equipment, and other amenities suited for younger children.
The City’s population makeup will naturally change over time, and these
shifts influence preferences for recreational programs. Westminster’s senior
population is a significant part of its demographic makeup, and surveys point
toward a greater demand for more “active” recreational outlets than in past
generations. On the other end of the age spectrum, significant increases in
the younger adult population will require a focus on more children- and
youth-oriented activities and facilities.
The following goal and policies help to ensure a responsive and
comprehensive park and recreational system for Westminster.

       GOAL PR-1:         PARK FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
       A diverse system of safe and accessible local public park and recreation
       facilities that meets the varied needs of the Westminster community.
       POLICIES
       PR-1.1        Park Types. Provide a range of park types and amenities to meet
                     the active and passive recreational needs of all Westminster
                     residents, regardless of age, ability, or income.
       PR-1.2        Parkland Standards. Achieve a minimum parkland standard of
                     three acres per 1,000 City residents. Parkland includes traditional
                     parks and recreation facilities, multiuse pathways, off-street
                     bicycle lanes (for example, the Hoover Bicycle Route), and joint-
                     use facilities throughout the City (such as school facilities).
       PR-1.3        Service Area Radius. Focus new park facilities in areas that are
                     outside ¼-mile walking radius from an existing or proposed park
                     or bike trail, and enhance options for residents to access these
                     facilities through safe walking, bicycling, and transit routes.
                     Physical barriers such as I-405 and SR-22 should also be
                     considered when evaluating service area and access.
       PR-1.4        New Facilities. Pursue the development of new parks and
                     recreational facilities at utility easements, flood control channels,
                     railroad rights-of-way, vacant parcels, and underutilized facilities.
       PR-1.5        Open Space in Nonresidential Development. Encourage
                     nonresidential development, including commercial centers,
                     industrial uses, and public facilities, to provide on-site open
                     space for employee use.
       PR-1.6        Safety. Enhance park safety through playground design, crime
                     prevention technology, night lighting, natural surveillance,
                     unobtrusive landscaping, and increased police and community-
                     based patrols.
       PR-1.7        Accessible Facilities. Require that new park facility construction
                     and existing facility retrofits meet accessibility standards defined
                     by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and playground
                     safety requirements (Senate Bill 2733).
       PR-1.8        Park Design. Encourage new and existing parks to incorporate
                     sustainable landscape and development practices that limit
                     water usage and energy consumption, such as drought-resistant
                     landscaping and low impact development standards.
       PR-1.9        Community Input. Ensure that programs and facilities in parks
                     reflect the priorities of residents in the surrounding
                     neighborhoods. Regularly conduct community outreach,
                     workshops, and ongoing conversations with neighborhoods to
                     solicit public input on park issues
       PR-1.10       Quality Parks. Design parks with attention to place-making
                     elements that foster social interaction and community pride by
                     incorporating design elements (art, landscape, monuments,
                     murals, play equipment, benches) based on a unique theme
                     within each park. Where possible, local and historical cultural
                     elements should be reflected in the park’s design.

Management of Parks and Recreation Facilities
The Westminster Community Services and Recreation Department
collaborates with several public agencies, nonprofits, the local business
community, community volunteers, schools, and other organizations to
provide for the proper development, management, and maintenance of its
parks and recreation facilities.
                                                                                   The City can partner with other

To meet the challenge of serving the community’s diverse parks and                 groups, including school
recreational needs, the City should proactively collaborate with other public,     districts, to help meet the
private, and nonprofit entities to develop and maintain a diverse range of

recreation facilities and services and offset park deficiency. In Westminster,
school districts are key players in providing parks and recreational facilities to community’s diverse parks and
Westminster residents, particularly youth. As discussed in the Introduction        recreational needs.
section of this element, the City will explore joint-use agreements with the
school districts that serve Westminster in an effort to expand the range of
facilities available on a regular basis for public use.
Since the City’s Community Services and Recreation Department is committed
to providing such a diverse range of park and recreational facilities, a
collaborative approach will be essential to ensure that those facilities and
services meet the demands.
Funding
Quimby ordinance fees, developer agreements, and grants can fund the
development of public open space, and impact fees and other types of grants
can pay for the improvements to existing parks and recreation facilities.
Future funding sources may include, but are not limited to, assessment
districts, foundation grants, and gifts from private benefactors.
Park Safety and Maintenance
Parks are among the most cherished amenities in Westminster, and their
continued use and enjoyment depend greatly on their condition and safety.
Parks and recreational facilities should be regularly patrolled, maintained, and
equipped with the latest in surveillance technology to prevent deterioration,
ensure their safety, and permit continued public use.
Many of the City’s park and recreational facilities were built long ago and need
rehabilitation and modernization. In 2015, the City invested over $10 million
into maintenance and repair of its existing facilities. The City’s future park and
recreational facilities master plan will help to address future maintenance needs
and provide an action plan for the continued operation of Westminster’s parks
and recreation facilities. In addition, the General Plan prioritizes the need for
facility reinvestment and the development of funding and implementation
steps. This may require additional fees or taxes to implement properly.
The following goals and policies help to prioritize the need for regular
maintenance and reinvestment to ensure the continued use and safety of park
and recreational facilities.

Recreational Programs and Events
Given that availability of traditional park space is limited in Westminster,
programming of public spaces takes on an elevated importance. Recreational
programming and special events can benefit a community in a number of
ways: they can create a sense of belonging and identity; provide educational
and social opportunities; promote healthy lifestyles; improve cultural unity;
and improve the quality of life for members of the community regardless of
their age, ability, income level, or culture.
In addition to planning for and managing park spaces, the City of
Westminster’s Community Services and Recreation Department (CSRD) is
dedicated to providing quality recreational programs and supportive services
for all Westminster residents. The CSRD has established an extensive
recreational program that includes youth and adult classes, sports leagues,
and special event coordination. Most of the youth and adult programs run
during the school year at Bolsa Chica Park, Liberty Park, and Sigler Park, and
have special extended schedules for winter and summer vacations. The CSRD
also initiated the “Fun on Wheels” mobile van program, which travels to
several locations throughout the City and provides free, quality activities on a
drop-in basis throughout the summer.
                                                                                       The Summer Concerts Series held at the

Diversity of Recreation Activities
The City of Westminster has a diverse population, so a variety of recreation
programs and leisure opportunities is important to address their diverse
needs. A broad spectrum of recreation programs provides opportunities to
come together around a common need and interest—recreation—that spans
the differences in our ages, income levels, cultures, and abilities.
Youth and Children
Many of the Westminster recreational programs entertain, educate, and
enrich the community’s youth. The CSRD offers a number of youth programs             Bolsa Chica Co-Op Nursery

Organization, Huntington West Little League, District 62 Challenger Baseball,
Junior All American Football, and National Junior Basketball.

                                           variety of community resources offered throughout Westminster and offers
                                           numerous craft vendor booths; children’s activities; and displays from the
                                           local police, fire, and public works departments. The CSRD also coordinates
                                           with privately sponsored events, such as the Tet Parade. Various city
                                           departments collaborate with private interests to create this cultural event
                                           that is unique to Westminster.
                                           Supportive Recreational Services
                                           Looking toward the future, Westminster will continue to plan for the
                                           emerging needs of the community. These needs may arise out of
                                           demographic change, preferences for different types of recreational activities
                                           or programs, and emerging issues in health and wellness.

                                           The CSRD currently offers several health and nutrition programs that help to
                                           foster healthy lifestyles for all residents, including first aid, CPR, and support
                                           for residents who want to stop smoking.

In addition, the Westminster Family Resource Center partners with several local
health agencies to provide counseling, dental and medical assistance, and
health and exercise education classes for low income families in the
community. The Orange County Community Service Center is also located in
Westminster, where representatives from the OC Health Care Agency are
available to meet with county residents and provide health-related information.

       Related Plans and Programs
       The Parks and Recreation element supports and implements several state and
       local laws and plans.
       Quimby Act
       The Quimby Act (1975) is state legislation that authorizes cities and counties
       to pass ordinances requiring that developers set aside land, donate
       conservation easements, or pay fees for park improvements. Revenues
       generated through the Quimby Act cannot be used for the operation and
       maintenance of park facilities (CGC § 66477). The 1982 amendment to
       Quimby was designed to hold local governments accountable for imposing
       park development fees. Cities and counties were required to be more
       accountable and to show a strong direct relationship or nexus between park
       fee exactions and proposed projects. Local ordinances must now include
       definite standards for determining the proportion of the project to be
       dedicated and the amount of the fee to be paid.
       The City’s Quimby park ordinance establishes a standard of 3 acres of
       neighborhood and community parkland per 1,000 residents. Neighborhood
       and community parks typically include open space areas such as pocket
       parks, tot lots, community centers, sports courts, playgrounds, and passive
       recreation areas. It is also possible to count other types of open space,
       including school recreation facilities with joint-use agreements, multipurpose
       pathways, and common open space provided in developments.
       According to its Quimby standard, Westminster’s need for parkland at its
       buildout (118,000 residents) is 355 acres, far more than existing facilities
       currently provide (a common problem facing many of southern California’s
       built-out cities). In 2016, the City’s existing parkland ratio reflected
       approximately 1 acre of parkland per 1,000 residents. Given Westminster’s
       built-out nature, it is increasingly important for the City to look for creative
       opportunities to provide new open space experiences as part of new
       development and through partnerships with local school districts, use of
       utility facilities and rights-of-way, and redevelopment of underutilized
       properties.

Park Dedication Ordinance
One of the ways the City manages the provision of parkland is through the
Park Dedication Ordinance (§16.12.080), which requires either the payment of
fees or dedication of a portion of land based on the City’s parkland
requirements. These dedications are intended to help ensure current and
future residents have access to sufficient open space in the community.
Park and Recreation Facilities Master Plan
The City of Westminster will prepare a parks and recreation facilities master
plan to address Westminster’s future park and recreation needs by identifying
opportunities for park acquisition and development, and providing an action
plan for the continued operation and maintenance of Westminster’s parks
and recreation facilities. The master plan will help decision makers identify
and prioritize projects at Westminster’s existing and proposed park facilities.
Active Transportation Plan
The City of Westminster is preparing an active transportation plan (ATP) that
articulates the community’s vision for developing and improving pedestrian
and bicycle facilities within the City. Specifically, the plan will be used as a
vehicle for pursuing local, state, and federal funding to implement new
mobility connections in Westminster. One of the goals of the ATP is to identify  The City’s Active Transportation Plan

The Land Use Element identifies six mixed-use areas where the majority of
Westminster’s growth is anticipated over the next twenty years. As land uses
in these areas transition over time to accommodate new homes and retail
uses, there will be a corresponding increase in infrastructure and natural
resource demands. The goals and policies in this element are crafted to
ensure that current and future generations are well served by a
comprehensive infrastructure program; have access to precious natural
resources; and know how to conserve these resources, especially in light of
local, regional, and state legislation.
California Government Code, Section 65303, allows a city or county to
address, in its general plan, issues or topics that may influence the physical
development of the planning area, such as an infrastructure system. Though
the Government Code does not require a city to include policy guidance
related to infrastructure planning, the City of Westminster has identified this
topic as a priority and has elected to cover it in detail in the first half of this
element. The second half addresses topics required by Government Code,
Section 65302, requiring a general plan to address the conservation,                  Residential homes throughout
development, and utilization of natural resources. In Westminster, a city that        Westminster feature roof-mounted

                                            Infrastructure
                                            A reliable resource infrastructure system provides fundamental services for the
                                            City. This includes a variety of physical facilities for the conveyance of vital
                                            services and functions, such as water storage and distribution, wastewater
                                            collection and treatment, storm drainage and flood control, solid waste disposal,
                                            and telecommunications. Physical infrastructure systems are often taken for
                                            granted, but they are an essential part of the community’s quality of life.
                                            Water System
                                            Ensuring the long-term supply of water is one of the most critical issues facing
                                            Westminster and communities throughout California. Declining groundwater
                                            resources and state and federal laws have made it increasingly challenging to
                                            maintain reliable sources of water. The City of Westminster and its water
                                            providers recognize that the long-term solution to this challenge must
                                            include an integrated water management approach. Westminster also
                                            supports water conservation efforts and promotes the improvement of its
                                            production facilities, storage facilities, pumping stations, and distribution
                                            systems.
                                            The City of Westminster provides water service and distributes water to the
                                            City’s residents and businesses and part of Midway City. The City’s Urban
                                            Water Management Plan identifies the framework for how the City manages
                                            its water resources to ensure the system’s reliability, particularly during
                                            multiple dry years (drought).
                                            Water Supplies
                                            Westminster receives water from two main sources: imported water from the
                                            Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), imported water
                                            from the Municipal Water District of Orange County (MWDOC), and
                                            groundwater pumped from Orange County Water District (OCWD) wells. As of
                                            2016, approximately 70 percent of the City’s water supply is from 10 city
                                            owned groundwater wells within the City’s boundaries. The City has drilled
                                            two groundwater wells since the 2005 Urban Water Management Plan and
                                            upgraded some of the smaller, inefficient wells with new, higher-yielding and
                                            more efficient wells. There are currently no plans to add new groundwater
                                            wells or import connections.
                                            The City has a 16-million-gallon reservoir facility that was constructed in 2003
                                            and consists of two 8-million-gallon storage tanks, four booster pumps, and a
                                            3,000-gallon per minute well.
  7-2                                     City of Westminster General Plan | Infrastructure and Natural Resources

Since local water supplies do not meet all of Westminster’s demand, water is
imported from the San Francisco-San Joaquin Bay Delta via the State Water
Project, and the Colorado River via the Colorado River Aqueduct. Water
imports are transferred by the MWDOC from the MWD. MWDOC is one of 28
member agencies in MWD’s service area, and Westminster has three active
import water connections.
Water Quality
The Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and other laws require public
agencies to achieve water quality standards to protect public health and the
beneficial uses of California’s waterways. The City of Westminster meets or
exceeds all United States Environmental Protection Agency and State of
California Department of Public Health drinking water standards. These two
agencies govern the water quality of public drinking water systems.
Stormwater System
The City of Westminster is served by two primary flood control and drainage
systems:
     1.  City-operated and -maintained storm drain system, including catch
         basins and storm drain pipes
     2.  Flood control facilities operated and maintained by the Orange
         County Flood Control District, including the large flood control
         channels in the City.
Though storm drains are designed to carry only stormwater, urban runoff—         County-operated flood control
                                                                                 channels are an essential part of the

contaminants ultimately travel, untreated, to local water bodies, including the
Westminster Channel, Bolsa Chica Channel, East Garden Grove-Wintersberg
Channel, and Anaheim-Barber City Channel, before ending up in Anaheim
Bay, Huntington Harbor, and the Pacific Ocean. To prevent this, the regional
water quality control board enforces the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) to clean up water resources and reduce the
amount of stormwater runoff. Under the NPDES Stormwater Permit issued to
the County of Orange and its co-permittees (including Westminster), the City
requires the majority of new development projects to incorporate best
management practices to minimize pollutant levels in runoff.
Water Service to Disadvantaged Communities
In the City of Westminster, there are several disadvantaged community
islands throughout the central portion of the City (for more information, see
the discussion on disadvantaged communities in the Related Plans, Programs,
and Legislation section at the end of this element). These islands are served by
an existing water service provider (the City of Westminster) and a storm drain
system owned and operated by the City of Westminster and Orange County
Flood Control District. The county flood control district and the City have
mechanisms in place to ensure the water and storm drain systems are
functioning (operation and maintenance) and will not negatively impact the
regions of the City with disadvantaged communities.
The following goal and policies implement a strategic and sustainable plan
for water delivery. Note that policies specific to water conservation are
included later in this element under the natural resources section.

Wastewater Management
The wastewater system in Westminster is maintained by Midway City Sanitary
District (MCSD) and the Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD).
Wastewater is sent to OCSD’s two treatment plants in Fountain Valley and
Huntington Beach. Both plants treat the water with primary and secondary
treatment. The first plant sends secondary-treated water to OCWD, who
performs tertiary treatment for recycled water; in 2015 about 12 percent was
recycled. The second treatment plant treats the sewage and discharges it per
state and federal regulations. MCSD expects its current sewer lines to last up
to 100 years. The oldest portions of sewer lines are in the central areas of the
City and should continue to be monitored for adequacy.
Disadvantaged Communities
The existing sewer system provides sewer services to the City’s disadvantaged
communities (for more information, see the discussion on disadvantaged
communities in the Related Plans, Programs, and Legislation section at the end
of this element). There are mechanisms in place by OCSD and MCSD to ensure
the sewer system is functioning and will not negatively impact the regions of
the City with disadvantaged communities.
GOAL INR-2:        WASTEWATER SYSTEM
A wastewater collection and treatment system adequate to serve the
long-range needs of the community.
POLICIES
INR-2.1       Sewer Facilities Master Plan. Maintain a Citywide Sewer
              Facilities Master Plan to identify existing and future wastewater
              treatment needs, implement needed improvements, and
              identify potential funding sources.
INR-2.2       Service Standards. Continue to coordinate land use
              development with the Midway City Sanitary District to provide
              adequate collection, supply, treatment, and disposal of
              wastewater and adherence to adopted service standards for
              sewer service systems.

      Solid Waste and Recycling
      The State of California requires communities to be proactive in addressing
      waste management for many reasons—the shortage of landfill space, the cost
      of natural resources to manufacture goods, and the air pollution resulting from
      manufacturing. In 1989, the state legislature passed Assembly Bill 939, the
      landmark bill requiring recycling in California. The bill established the California
      Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) and required the preparation of
      countywide integrated waste management plans; the CIWMB is now the
      California Department of Resources, Recycling and Recover (CalRecycle). AB 939
      also required all municipalities to divert 25 percent of their solid waste from
      landfill disposal through source reduction, recycling, and composting, by
      January 1, 1995, and half of the waste stream needed to be diverted by the year
      2000. The City of Westminster completed its Source Reduction and Recycling
      Element (SRRE), consistent with AB 939, in March 1992. As a follow-up to AB
      939, Assembly Bill 341 increased the statewide solid waste diversion goal to 75
      percent by 2020 and mandated recycling for commercial and multifamily
      residential land uses, schools, and school districts.
      Waste Collection and Disposal
      The MCSD collects solid waste and provides recycling services to the City of
      Westminster and its sphere of influence. In 2014, nearly 99 percent of the
      solid waste landfilled from the City of Westminster was disposed of at the
      Frank Bowerman Landfill near the City of Irvine. This landfill was opened in
      1990 and is scheduled to close in 2053.
      Waste Diversion
      The MCSD follows the “reduce, reuse, recycle” model of waste diversion in an
      effort to stop trash before it starts. Westminster residents and businesses have
      access to a range of waste diversion programs and services, including
      composting, household hazardous waste, electronic waste, public education,
      recycling, and source reduction programs; and special waste materials
      programs, including concrete/asphalt/rubble and tires.
      The following goal and policies advance the City’s efforts in implementing its
      integrated waste management programs.
            Disposable Rate Targets
            Compliance with AB 939 is measured in part by comparing actual
            disposal rates for residents and employees to target rates (actual
            rates at or below target rates are consistent with AB 939). The target
            disposal rate for Westminster residents in 2014 was 6.3 pounds per
            day (ppd) per resident, and the actual disposal rate was 3.2 ppd per
            resident. The target disposal rate for Westminster employees was
            27.7 ppd per employee, and the actual rate was 13.3 ppd per
            employee. These rates demonstrate that Westminster is achieving its
            disposal rate targets, and both residents and employees are
            consistent with AB 939 targets.

Natural Resources and Conservation
The City of Westminster has natural resources within and outside its
boundaries and is committed to the conservation and protection of biological
resources, energy, and water. Preserving the quality of these resources is not
only beneficial to current residents, but crucial to the sustainability of future
generations.
Biological
Westminster is largely urbanized with few remaining natural open spaces,
and its landscapes primarily consist of nonnative ornamental species that
have been planted around commercial, residential, and industrial buildings; in
parking lots; along streets; and in the open space areas of the City’s parks and
schools. Various tree species provide suitable nesting and roosting habitat for
resident and migratory bird species. Wildlife in Westminster is limited to
species that are adapted to highly urbanized areas, such as birds and small
mammal species including raccoons, skunks, opossum, ground squirrels, and
small rodents.
Street trees in Westminster are protected by the Street Forest Policy in the
City’s Municipal Code. Construction operations must place guard devices
around vegetation along streets and alleys and in public places to prevent
damage to the vegetation, and removal of street trees is subject to the City’s
review. The City has a Heritage Tree Program, whereby the City designates
specific trees in City parks as heritage trees due to their age, size, origin,
uniqueness, and/or national or regional rarity. The designation affords some
protection for trees, because permission from the Community Services
Commission is necessary before removing any listed tree.
Energy
The use of electricity, natural gas, and transportation fuels helps society
function, but also creates a dependency on these energy resources. It is          Southern California Edison is the
therefore imperative to use them efficiently to conserve them for future          primary supplier of electricity to the
generations. Additionally, climate change is increasingly acknowledged as the     city.
result of greenhouse gases (GHGs) being released into the air faster than the
earth’s natural systems can reabsorb them. The predominant source of GHG
emissions in most cities is energy use in automobiles, buildings, and large-scale
public utilities such as water transmission. The long-term solution to GHG
reduction must include decreasing/conserving energy use and increasing
production of renewable energy (solar or wind power). See the Air Quality
section of the Public Health and Safety Element for additional details.
State law already requires Southern California Edison to diversify its sources of
energy to include renewable sources like wind and solar. The City of
Westminster has an active Energy Committee that oversees the energy
efficiency activities of the City. The City adopted Resolution 4101 to
participate in the California Energy Commission Technical Assistance
Program, which is committed to seeking funding to implement specific
energy projects. The City has also demonstrated its commitment to energy
conservation by pursuing Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED) Certification for some if its development projects, including the Police   The Westminster Police
Building, which is certified LEED Platinum.                                       Headquarters is a LEED Platinum-

                                            Water Conservation
                                            Conserving water is essential to a long-term reliable water supply, and the
                                            urban water management plan has a drought contingency plan. During a
                                            drought, the City’s water shortage contingency plan has three stages of
                                            response based on the severity of drought—shortage, severe shortage, and
                                            extreme shortage. Besides mandated reductions during drought,
                                            Westminster also requires a range of best practices to control the use of
                                            potable water where feasible. Strategies include the use of water-efficient
                                            landscaping in new development and tiered water rates that encourage
                                            conservation.
                                            The Westminster City Council adopted the Water Conservation and Supply
                                            Shortage Program Ordinance No. 2449 in 2009, which establishes permanent
                                            water conservation requirements and prohibitions against waste that are in
                                            effect at all times and do not depend on a water shortage for implementation.
                                            In addition to local water conservation ordinances, the City has partnered
                                            with the Municipal Water District of Orange County on educational programs,
      The City’s Water Division regularly   indoor retrofits, and training. These efforts have been part of statewide water

      water conservation best practices.
                                            cleaned by hotels.
                                            The City’s public education and outreach program is administered by
                                            MWDOC, which has established an extensive public education and outreach
                                            program to assist its retail agencies in promoting water use efficiency
                                            awareness in their service areas. MWDOC has five primary program types—
                                            school education programs, value of water communication programs,
                                            quarterly water policy dinners, an annual water summit, and water inspection
                                            trips.
                                            The Westminster Water Division also holds regular public engagement events
                                            to discuss the state of the drought, water supply, and practical steps every
                                            resident can take to save water. The Water Division has found that individual
                                            contact with residents has the greatest impact on behavioral change and has
                                            held Drought Town Halls and HOA and Neighborhood Watch meetings in
                                            high-consumption areas to discuss how to reduce water waste and demand.
                                            The Water Division also participates in citywide events like Día de la Familia,
                                            Spring Festival, Safety Day, Tet Parade and Flower Festival, and Community

                                         The Infrastructure and Natural Resources Element sets broad goals and
                                         policies to facilitate adequate infrastructure and natural resources and
                                         conservation. These goals and policies are implemented by master plans,
                                         some provided by the City and others by regional entities.
                                         2010 Urban Water Management Plan
                                         The Urban Water Management Planning Act of 1995 states that every urban
                                         water supplier shall prepare and adopt an urban water management plan (to
                                         be updated every 4 years) that:

»    Implements conservation and the efficient use of urban water supplies.
     Significant new requirements for quantified demand reductions were
     added by the Water Conservation Act of 2009 (SBX7-7), which amends
     the 1995 act and adds new water conservation provisions to the Water
     Code.
The Westminster Urban Water Management Plan addresses long-term plans
to deal with water system needs and meet supply demand projections
through buildout development. The plan demonstrates how the City
effectively manages use of limited resources available to the Water Division.
Midway City Sanitary District Sewer System Master Plan
and Strategic Plan
In 2015, the MCSD Board of Directors adopted a new comprehensive Sewer
System Master Plan to drive MCSD’s efforts and engage the organization to
envision service and operations of the sewer system (this report is updated
every two years). A corresponding Strategic Plan is updated annually and
evaluates a five-year horizon for the entire district. The most recent strategic
plan was adopted in 2016. The City of Westminster recognizes that MCSD is
an important partner in achieving many of the City’s General Plan goals, and
this Infrastructure and Natural Resources Element seeks to assist in
implementing MCSD’s Strategic Plan goals as defined in the Sewer System
Master Plan and Strategic Plan.
Senate Bill 244: Disadvantaged Communities
Senate Bill 244 requires cities and counties to address the infrastructure needs
of unincorporated disadvantaged communities in general plans. A
disadvantaged community is an unincorporated fringe, island, or legacy
community in which the median household income is 80 percent or less than
the statewide median household income. The Westminster Land Use Element
provides a complete overview of the four Orange County islands that are
within Westminster’s sphere of influence, three of which are wholly or
partially classified as disadvantaged communities based on the 2010 Census.
Senate Bill 244 also requires cities to analyze the water, wastewater,
stormwater drainage, and structural fire protection needs and financial
funding alternatives for the extension of services to identified disadvantaged
communities. This Infrastructure and Natural Resources Element addresses
this requirement for water, wastewater, and stormwater drainage, and the
Public Health and Safety Element addresses fire protection needs.
Assembly Bills 939 and 341
The Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (Public Resources Code
§§ 40050 et seq.) established an integrated waste-management system that
focused on source reduction, recycling, composting, and land disposal of
waste. AB 939 required every California city and county to divert 50 percent of
its waste from landfills by the year 2000 and a 75 percent diversion rate by
2020. Compliance with AB 939 is measured in part by comparing solid waste
disposal rates for a jurisdiction with target disposal rates. Actual rates at or
below target rates are consistent with AB 939. AB 939 also requires California
counties to show 15 years of disposal capacity for all jurisdictions in the
county or show a plan to transform or divert its waste. AB 939 is supported by
AB 341 (Mandatory Commercial Recycling), which provides direction to
reduce GHG emissions by diverting commercial solid waste to recycling

       efforts and to expand the opportunity for additional recycling services and
       recycling manufacturing facilities in California.
       Westminster Energy Action Plan
       The City has developed an Energy Action Plan that identifies ways the city can
       meet the greenhouse gas reduction goals established by Assembly Bill 32,
       The California Global Warming Act. AB 32 set a target to decrease emissions
       statewide to 1990 levels by the year 2020. The City's Energy Action Plan
       establishes the City's long-term vision and funding strategy for energy
       efficiency projects to meet its share of reducing energy consumption and
       greenhouse gas emissions.
       The primary objectives of the Energy Action Plan are to: 1) reduce the city's
       carbon footprint and its adverse impacts on the environment, 2) conserve
       energy at local government facilities, and 3) raise energy conservation
       awareness in the community. So far the City has implemented a number of
       energy efficiency projects, including the retrofit of street lights and lighted
       street signs. In addition, it has integrated these principles into the
       development of new facilities such as the Miriam Warne Community Building,
       which received LEED Silver certification.
       20x2020 Water Conservation Plan
       The 20x2020 Water Conservation Plan was issued by the California
       Department of Water Resources (DWR) in 2010 pursuant to Senate Bill 7
       (SBX7-7). SBX7-7 authorized the DWR to prepare a plan which implemented
       urban water conservation requirements—known as the 20x2020 Water
       Conservation Plan. SBX7-7 requires urban water providers to adopt a water
       conservation target of 20 percent reduction in urban per capita water use by
       2020.
       To comply with SBx7-7 regulations, Westminster has joined the tiered Orange
       County 20X2020 Regional Alliance with 29 retail agencies, the Municipal
       Water District of Orange County, and the Metropolitan Water District of
       Southern California. MWDOC reports on Westminster’s daily per capita water
       use, and in 2010 the City’s water use was well below the minimum water use
       reduction target for 2020.To comply with these restrictions, the Westminster
       City Council has enacted several water restrictions on outdoor watering,
       decorative water features, car washing, leak repair, and filling pools.
       Governor’s Drought Declaration
       California Governor Edmund Brown Jr. declared a drought state of emergency
       on January 17, 2014, asking Californians to reduce water use by 20 percent. In
       response to the drought, the State Water Resources Control Board adopted
       Resolution No. 2014-0038 (July 15, 2014) and emergency regulations to
       ensure that water suppliers, their customers, and state residents increase
       water conservation and prohibit wasting water in urban settings. Water
       suppliers are required to activate their Water Shortage Contingency Plan,
       educate customers and employees, increase local supplies, and report
       progress.

relevant hazard (CA Gov’t Code § 65302[g]). Although the topic of air quality
is not required in a city’s general plan, the City of Westminster has elected to
address it in this element.
The Public Health and Safety Element is supported by and consistent with the
other elements of this General Plan, including the Land Use Element (land
uses are influenced by the location of potential hazards), Mobility Element
(promotes improved air quality through a reduction in vehicle miles traveled),
and Infrastructure and Natural Resources Element (identifies the City’s critical
infrastructure facilities, which support improved public safety).

                                            Police protection in the City of Westminster is provided by the Westminster
                                            Police Department (WPD), and the Orange County Sheriff’s Department,
                                            North Operations Division, provides that service to the unincorporated
                                            community of Midway City. WPD is highly valued throughout the community
                                            and provides a wide range of emergency response services and community
                                            programs to suppress crime and improve traffic safety, while maintaining
                                            high professional standards.
                                            The WPD’s new headquarters opened in 2011 in the City’s Civic Center.

                                            organized into various units and divisions, including:
                                                    Animal Control                           Management Services

Volunteer and Community Policing
Although it is the responsibility of the police department to ensure a safe
living and working environment in Westminster, public safety is also a
community-wide effort. The WPD is committed to strengthening its ties with
the community by providing interactive and volunteer programs, easier
access to resources, and community education. These programs include:
         Neighborhood Watch
         Explorer Program
         Strategic Home Intervention and Early Leadership Development
          program (SHIELD)
         Citizens Police Academy
Citizens Police Academy participants enroll in a 10-week program to learn
about emergency calls, police discretion and ethics, street gangs, SWAT,
narcotics, criminal investigations, and more. The Explorer Program is offered
to young adults between the ages of 14 and 21 interested in law
enforcement. Explorers gain first-hand experience with law enforcement
careers—they aid with traffic control at public events, fingerprinting, bike
licensing, and rooftop surveillance of automobiles in parking lots. Through
programs like these, the WPD hopes to empower and improve the overall
quality of life for Westminster residents.
Safe Neighborhoods
Neighborhood safety can be enhanced through code enforcement—the City
can ensure a certain quality of life for Westminster residents and that
neighborhood and property values are preserved and maintained. Code
enforcement staff works closely with the WPD to examine properties—either
in response to a complaint or as part of an ongoing, proactive program—in
order to protect residents, visitors, and businesses. Code enforcement
programs in Westminster address:
         Abandoned vehicle abatement
         Enforcement of home businesses ordinance
         Illegal accessory structures inspection
         Graffiti abatement and public nuisances
         Monitoring pollutant discharge in the storm drain system
Traffic Safety/Control
The Traffic Division of the WPD enforces federal and state traffic laws and
manages the investigation and documentation of traffic collisions. In
Westminster, enforcement efforts focus on busy intersections, streets, and
other areas of concern, as identified by traffic safety statistics. The Traffic
Division manages many of Westminster’s special events to ensure the orderly
control of traffic and playing. The Traffic Division and WPD as a whole actively
seek to create safe streets for all users, including drivers, pedestrians,
bicyclists, and transit users.
Orange County Sheriff’s Department
The Orange County Sheriff’s Department provides police protection services to
the unincorporated county island of Midway City from its West Substation in
the City of Stanton at 11100 Cedar Street. Sheriff’s department services include
staffing for service calls, preventive patrol, traffic enforcement, and specialized
enforcement. Currently, the West Substation is adequate to handle the existing
personnel and equipment employed and used by the sheriff’s department.

from which most insurance rates are based. The ISO rating consists of three
components—fire dispatch, fire department operations, and sufficiency of
water supply and infrastructure. Westminster (in the ISO West region)
maintains a Class 3 rating out of 10, where 1 generally represents superior
property fire protection, and Class 10 indicates that the area’s fire suppression
program doesn’t meet ISO’s minimum criteria. Westminster’s rating is typical
for most cities in the southern California region.

                                     Although seismic shaking from the San Andreas Fault would have local
                                     impacts, the seismic shaking damage from the Newport-Inglewood Fault and
                                     the San Joaquin Hills Fault would likely be more substantial due to their
                                     proximity to Westminster. The Newport-Inglewood Fault, which runs from
                                     Inglewood through Huntington Beach and out into the Pacific Ocean in the
                                     Newport Beach area, is capable of producing earthquakes in the magnitude
                                     6.3 to 7.5 range. This fault was responsible for the magnitude 6.4 earthquake
                                     in Long Beach in 1933.

Ground Shaking
Ground motion/shaking is the primary cause of damage and injury during
earthquakes and can result in surface rupture, liquefaction, landslides, lateral
spreading, differential settlement, and building and infrastructure failure,
which could lead to fire and other collateral damage. Ground movement
during an earthquake depends on the magnitude of the earthquake, distance
to the fault, focus of the earthquake energy, and type of geologic material.
Areas underlain by bedrock usually experience less ground shaking than
areas underlain by unconsolidated soils.
Fires and structural failure are the most hazardous results of ground shaking.
Most earthquake-induced fires start from broken power lines, gas lines, or
electrical equipment. These problems can be exacerbated by damage to street
and hydrant infrastructure that may impact the ability to provide effective
emergency response after a significant seismic event.
Liquefaction
Liquefaction is when soils lose their load bearing capacity because of ground
shaking or other extreme pressure and behave like a liquid. Westminster is on
an alluvial floodplain and has the prerequisites for liquefaction—loose
unconsolidated soils, shallow groundwater, and the potential for strong
seismic shaking—which means the entire City is susceptible to liquefaction,
as depicted on Figure 8-2, Seismic Hazards.
Critical Structures and Utilities
Advances in engineering techniques and building codes have reduced the
threat of seismic-related collapse in new buildings. However, earlier buildings
are still at risk—unreinforced masonry, precast concrete tilt-up walls, soft-
stories, and nonductile concrete frames. Certain facilities in the City are
considered critical for disaster planning and recovery effort. Critical facilities
of particular concern in Westminster include: the Westminster Rose Center,
the Miriam Warne Community Building, the Police Department building,
Westminster City Hall, and the City Senior Center.
Seismic shaking and liquefaction can cause major damage to nearly all utility
systems, both aboveground and underground. Damage to phone lines
and/or cell towers will prevent automatic reporting of fires from sprinkler
monitoring systems. Damaged roads will impact effective emergency fire and
medical response. Ruptured water lines will also knock out hydrants and
sprinkler water supplies. Any one or a combination of these occurrences
could make the response and recovery process difficult and could place lives
and property at risk.
Building Codes and Development Standards
Pursuant to the Westminster Municipal Code, structures for human
occupancy must be designed and built to meet or exceed California Building
Code (CBC) standards for earthquake resistance. The CBC provides minimum
standards to protect property and public safety by regulating the design and
construction of excavations, foundations, building frames, retaining walls,
and other features to help mitigate the effects of earthquakes. The CBC also
provides additional seismic safety standards for schools, hospitals,
infrastructure, and critical facilities.

                    areas with potential for geologic or seismic hazards prepare a
                    geotechnical hazard study that addresses and offers mitigation
                    for ground shaking, landslides, liquefaction, expansive soils,
                    subsidence, and erosion.
       PHS-3.3      State and Local Safety Standards. Enforce state and local
                    seismic and geologic safety laws, standards, and guidelines,
                    including the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act,
                    Seismic Hazard Mapping Act, and the California Building Code
                    throughout Westminster.
       PHS-3.4      Utility Systems Resilience. Coordinate with relevant utility
                    service providers to ensure that major utility systems remain
                    resilient in the event of a major earthquake or other seismic
                    hazard.
       PHS-3.5      Multi-agency Cooperation. Develop cooperative partnerships
                    and strengthen communication among public agencies,

                                       Over the years, Westminster has suffered from a number of flooding events,
                                       many of which were catalysts to improving the way the community addresses
                                       flood hazards and mitigates impacts. The Los Angeles flood of 1938
                                       inundated much of Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties, and five
                                       major rivers overtopped their banks. The area from Beach Boulevard to Ward
                                       Street and Garfield Avenue to the ocean was under water, and more than 100
                                       people lost their lives. This flood was the reason for the construction of the
                                       Prado Dam.
                                       Since that time, improvements have been made to the Westminster channel
                                       between Magnolia and Brookhurst, to the East Garden Grove/Wintersburg
                                       Channel, and to the flood control channel on Hazard Avenue just west of
                                       Beach Boulevard, which eliminated many historical flooding issues on surface
                                       streets in Westminster. The City also installed new storm drain systems in the
   Drainage swales play in important   area of Pacific and 10th Street, and Richardson Way and 19th Street, which
         role in water management.     eliminated a majority of the surface flooding issues. Heavy rain can still cause
                                       localized flooding, but not as much as previously observed.
                                       Critical Facilities
                                       During flooding events, utilities and other critical facilities can suffer
                                       significant damage. A flood can sweep away everything in its path, including
                                       aboveground infrastructure such as electricity line poles and traffic signal
                                       control boxes. When the water mixes with sediment, oil, and/or sewage,
                                       flooding can also damage roads and block storm drains, which can further
                                       exacerbate the damage. Underground infrastructure can be damaged by
                                       inundation or exposed, requiring repair or reconstruction. To mitigate these
                                       impacts, utilities in flood-prone areas should be designed and constructed
                                       accordingly, and flood-proofing techniques should be identified in
                                       communities with above-ground infrastructure to ensure continued
                                       operations during floods.

Seismically Induced Inundation
Dam failures can result from a number of natural or human causes, and the
potential and severity for flooding depends on the speed of inundation,
topography, and location of the dam failure. Seismically induced inundation
refers to flooding that occurs when water retention structures, such as dams,
fail due to an earthquake. During a dam failure, a flood wave gradually builds
to a peak and then declines until the reservoir is empty. Dam failure can result
in loss of life, property damage, and displacement of persons residing in the
inundation path. Damage to electricity-generating facilities and transmission
lines could also impact life support systems in communities outside the
immediate hazard areas.
In Westminster, the Prado Dam on the Santa Ana River poses potential
inundation hazards, because the entire city is within its inundation zone. In the
event of a dam failure, floodwaters from Prado Dam would flow through the
relatively narrow, 10-mile-long Santa Ana Canyon. The floodway ranges from
about 3,000 feet wide in the canyon to over 15 miles wide downstream at
Interstate 5. The densely populated flood zone extends approximately 21
linear miles and would impact approximately 110,000 acres and well over one
million people.

Hazardous Materials
According to the California Health and Safety Code, materials are considered
“hazardous” when their quantity, concentration, or physical or chemical
characteristics can pose a significant hazard to human health and safety or to
the environment. “Hazardous materials” include toxic metals, chemicals, and     Superfund Site

locations, a number of roadways and underground pipelines are used to
transport hazardous materials in the City including Interstate 405, State Route
22, Beach Boulevard, and railroads. An accident involving vehicles or pipelines
transporting hazardous materials can impact nearby residents and
businesses.
Although past occurrences of hazardous spill incidents can indicate future
impacts, the mechanisms by which the City approves and regulates
businesses that use hazardous materials are constantly improving, as are
technological advances and industry standards. As a result, it is anticipated
that incidents will decrease over time as newer technologies, standards, and
regulations further improve safety and prevent and minimize releases of
hazardous materials.
Hazardous Waste Management
Managing the production, transport, and proper disposal of hazardous
materials is imperative to ensure a safe and healthy living environment in
Westminster. The City works in conjunction with several other government
entities to ensure a clean environment through various land use policies and
its municipal code, expediting the cleanup of contaminated sites, and making
sure proper measures are taken to manage hazardous materials and plan for
hazardous waste incidents.

       Properties contaminated with hazardous materials throughout the City are
       regulated at the federal, state, and local level and are subject to compliance
       with strict laws and regulations for investigation and remediation. The use,
       storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous materials by Westminster
       residents and commercial and industrial tenants or owners are required to
       comply with the regulations of several agencies, including:
                 The California Department of Toxic Substances Control
                 US Environmental Protection Agency
                 California Division of Occupational Safety and Health
                 California Department of Transportation
                 Orange County Health Care Agency
                 Orange County Fire Authority
                 Westminster Municipal Code
       Compliance with these agencies will ensure that all potentially hazardous
       materials are used and handled in an appropriate manner and minimize the
       potential for safety impacts.
       San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station
       The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station is approximately 35 miles
       southeast of Westminster. It was shut down in 2012 and permanently retired
       in 2013 after attempts to restart it failed. Although it is no longer operational,
       a large volume of nuclear waste is stored on site. Westminster is in the
       station’s “ingestion pathway zone,” that is, the area where radioactive
       material released from the plant could contaminate food or water and
       potentially be ingested. Orange County Health Care’s Environmental Health
       division is responsible for initiating the monitoring, sampling, and surveying
       of the probable and actual route of radioactive material from the San Onofre
       site.
          California Hazardous Chemical Emergency Planning and
          Community Right-to-Know Program
          In Westminster, the County of Orange is responsible for administering
          the state’s hazardous chemical emergency planning and community
          right-to-know program. In the event of a hazardous material incident in
          Westminster, the County of Orange will act as lead agency within the
          city limits and provide an incident commander to oversee the response
          efforts, with support from OCFA and the City’s Police and Public Works
          departments.

Critical Facilities
Certain facilities in the City are considered critical for disaster planning and
recovery effort. The City’s Local Hazard Mitigation Plan identifies 14 critical
facilities, including the police station, fire stations, several City-owned
properties, the Family Resource Center, Westminster Rose Center, Miriam
Warne Community Building, and key overpasses at Valley View Street,
Westminster Boulevard, and Beach Boulevard. Damage to these facilities has
the potential to impair response and recovery and may lead to disruption of
services. In addition to these facilities, other lifeline services are critical to the
City’s safety and survival, such as water, sewer, energy, communications, and
transportation. Preparing for emergencies includes building in system
redundancies so that a single event (e.g., power failure or road failure) does
not prevent the provision of essential services, such as paramedics or water
supply. Figure 8-4, Critical Facilities and Evacuation Routes, identifies the City’s
critical facilities.

important emergency access/evacuation routes for the City because of its
central location. Also, the Westminster Boulevard bridge at Bolsa Chica Road
provides a route across the Bolsa Chica channel at the west border of the City.
Several other key roadways could also be used as evacuation routes in the
event of an emergency, including Magnolia Street, Brookhurst Street, Garden
Grove Boulevard, and Westminster Boulevard.
The best evacuation route to use during an emergency depends on several
factors, including the type of emergency, its location, weather conditions,
road conditions, and traffic volume. Figure 8-4 identifies local, regional, and
state/federal evacuation routes.
Recovery and Prevention
After an emergency, the director of the California Office of Emergency
Services is responsible for bringing together representatives from federal,
state, operational area, and city agencies and the American Red Cross to
coordinate assistance and establish support priorities. After an emergency,
priorities include:
          Reinstatement of family autonomy
          Provision of essential public services
          Permanent restoration of public and private property
          Identification of residual hazards

       property damage, and disruption of vital services.
       Policies
       PHS-6.1     Critical Facilities. Coordinate with service providers to ensure
                   the resilience of critical facilities—including police and fire
                   stations, the Westminster Rose Center, and the Family Resource
                   Center—lifeline services, and infrastructure, and plan for the use
                   of critical facilities during postdisaster response and recovery.
       PHS-6.2     Emergency Operations and Hazards Planning. Ensure that the
                   City has an up-to-date local hazard mitigation plan and
                   emergency operations plan to be effective in responding to
                   emergencies and hazards.
       PHS-6.3     Emergency Management Systems. Ensure compliance
                   standards and protocol provisions are in place for emergency
                   response organization, communication, and incident
                   management to maintain eligibility for federal and state grants.
       PHS-6.4     Automatic and Mutual Aid. Continue to participate in
                   automatic and mutual aid agreements with adjacent service
                   providers to ensure efficient and adequate resources, facilities,
                   and support services during and after emergencies.
       PHS-6.5     Emergency Evacuation Routes and Access. Maintain, update,
                   and regularly exercise emergency access, protocols, warning
                   systems, and evacuation routes to assess their effectiveness.
       PHS-6.6     Disaster Preparedness. Work with relevant agencies to conduct
                   periodic emergency and disaster preparedness simulations with
                   other nearby jurisdictions to test and improve emergency
                   response.
       PHS-6.7     Public Education and Training. Enhance the public’s awareness
                   of emergency preparedness and public safety hazards through

                   Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) program.
       PHS-6.8     Communication. Maintain proper communication protocols
                   and procedures among emergency service providers; local, state,
                   and federal government agencies; businesses; schools; utilities;
                   and other relevant parties to ensure quick and efficient response
                   in the event of an emergency.

Air Quality
Over the years, Westminster has become increasingly more affected by
human activities that can negatively impact air quality (i.e., through increased
vehicle emissions). Transportation, industrial uses, and other activities using
fossil fuels release pollutants into the atmosphere that have caused both air
pollution and a global “greenhouse” effect.                                      Air Pollution (AKA “Smog”)

City are regulated and documented by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District (SCAQMD), the regulating authority over emission
sources in the South Coast Air Basin. Rules and regulations adopted by
SCAQMD limit the emissions that can be generated by various uses and
activities and identify specific pollution reduction measures that must be
implemented in association with various uses and activities. The California Air
Resources Board (CARB) also regulates air pollution emanating from
transportation sources—vehicles, trucks, railroads, and marine vessels.
The predominant source of air pollutants in Westminster is vehicular traffic.
Air pollutant emissions from traffic on freeways and corridors directly affect
adjacent areas. Other sources of pollution of concern in Westminster include
lawn and garden equipment and commercial equipment.
Sensitive Receptors
Sensitive receptors, such as schools, day care centers, hospitals, and
convalescent homes, are particularly sensitive to air pollutants because
children, the elderly, and the unwell are more susceptible to air-quality-
related health problems than the general public. Residential and recreational
land uses are also considered more sensitive to poor air quality because
people are usually home for extended periods of time, and activities
associated with recreational areas place a high demand on the respiratory
system. CARB recommends that sensitive land uses not be within 500 feet of a
freeway; after 500 feet, studies have shown significant decrease in pollution
levels.

                                     Climate Change
                                     Global climate change is one of the most widely discussed issues in the
                                     United States. Global climate change refers to a change in earth’s weather

                                     Greenhouse Gas Emissions
                                     The Earth’s temperature is determined by the balance between solar
                                     radiation that enters Earth’s atmosphere from space, and outgoing energy
                                     that is radiated back to space as heat. Atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs)
                                     absorb solar radiation and prevent heat from escaping the atmosphere.
                                     Greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called
                                     greenhouse gases. The four main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2),
                                     methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases (synthetic by-
                                     products of industrial processes). As the number of GHGs in the atmosphere
                                     increase, more heat is retained, which results in an overall warming of the
                                     atmosphere. For about 1,000 years before the industrial revolution, the
                                     amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remained relatively constant.
                                     However, the past 150 years have shown a rapid escalation in the warming
                                     rate that cannot be explained by natural causes alone.
                                     Although GHGs are needed to warm the Earth’s surface to a level that
                                     supports life on the planet, scientists believe that human activities, such as
                                     electricity generation, vehicle emissions, and farming practices, have
                                     increased the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere to the point of
                                     affecting the global climate. Careful and thorough attention must be paid to
                                     limiting GHG emissions in Westminster so that the community does its part to
                                     combat the devastating effects of global climate change.
                                     Emissions in Westminster
                                     Similar to other jurisdictions in southern California, Westminster’s GHG
                                     emissions primarily originate from transportation (vehicle trips beginning and
                                     ending in the City), residential and nonresidential building energy use, off-road
                                     equipment, solid waste management, and wastewater and water services.
                                     Fortunately, these five areas offer some of the best opportunities for reducing
                                     GHG reductions to meet the City’s mandated targets.

                                          Westminster Local Hazard Mitigation Plan
                                          The City of Westminster Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (2015) helps to reduce
                                          the community’s vulnerability to disasters by identifying critical facilities,
                                          capabilities, resources, information, and strategies for risk reduction and
                                          helping to guide and coordinate hazard mitigation actions. The updated plan
                                          ensures that the City evaluates current hazard conditions; that its policies are
                                          consistent with current City standards and/or other relevant federal, state, or

                                          The California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) was passed by the
                                          California state legislature on August 31, 2006, to place the state on a course
                                          toward reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. AB 32 follows Executive
                                          Order S-03-05’s mandate to reach 2000 emissions levels by 2010 and 1990
                                          levels by 2020.
                                          AB 32 directed CARB to establish a mandatory reporting system to track and
                                          monitor stationary sources that generate more than 25,000 metric tons of
                                          CO2-equivalent emissions per year; prepare a plan demonstrating how the

equivalent reductions are necessary to achieve the statewide emissions
reduction of AB 32 by 2020 (CARB 2012).
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is the MPO for
the Southern California region, which includes the counties of Los Angeles,
Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and Imperial. SCAG’s targets
under SB 375 are an 8 percent per capita reduction from 2005 GHG emission
levels by 2020 and a 13 percent reduction by 2035. SCAG’s current 2016-
2040 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy
(RTP/SCS) was adopted in April 2016 to update the 2012 RTP/SCS. In general,
the SCS outlines a development pattern for the region that, when integrated
with the transportation network and other transportation measures and
policies, would reduce vehicle miles traveled from automobiles and light duty
trucks and thereby reduce GHG emissions from these sources.
Senate Bill 375, the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act,
was adopted to connect the GHG emissions reductions targets established in
the 2008 Scoping Plan for the transportation sector to local land use decisions
