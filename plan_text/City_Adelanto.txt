    Housing Element
1. INTRODUCTION
    Incorporated in 1970, the City of Adelanto is located in the California
    High Desert, approximately 35 miles north of San Bernardino and
    approximately 60 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
    The housing needs of the City are determined by demographic
    characteristics of the population (age, household size, employment,
    ethnicity), and the characteristics of housing (number of units, tenure,
    size, cost). This Housing Element explores the characteristics of the
    existing and projected population and housing stock to define the extent
    of unmet housing needs in the City of Adelanto. This information will be
    used to update the City’s Housing Element goals, policies, programs, and
    actions in order to facilitate and encourage housing that fulfills the
    diverse needs of the community.
    ORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
    The City of Adelanto Housing Element for the planning period of
    October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2021 consists of the following sections:
        Introduction – This section introduces the Housing Element, its
          purpose, its content, State law governing its preparation, as well as
          an overview of the community outreach measures taken in
          preparing the document.
        Housing Needs Assessment – This section provides an overview of
          housing and population conditions in the City; the housing needs of
          special needs groups; housing affordability; and housing need.
        Housing Constraints – This section provides an overview of
          governmental, market, infrastructure, and environmental factors
          that may constrain the provision of housing in the City.
        Housing Resources and Opportunities – This section summarizes
          the land, financial, and administrative resources available for the
          development and preservation of housing.
                                                Page 5

City of Adelanto Housing Element
     Review of Previous Housing Element – This section summarizes
       the City’s accomplishments toward implementing the Housing
       Element adopted in 2012 for the 2008-2014 planning period.
     Housing Plan – This section outlines the City’s overall housing
       goals in the form of goals, policies, and programs.
 CONSISTENCY WITH STATE PLANNING LAW
 The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan elements
 mandated by the State of California. Sections 65580 to 65590 of the
 California Government Code contain the legislative mandate for the
 housing element. State law requires that the City's Housing Element
 consist of "an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs
 and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and
 scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement and development of
 housing" (Section 65583). In addition, the housing element shall identify
 adequate sites for housing, including rental housing, factory-built
 housing, and mobile homes, and shall make adequate provision for the
 existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community.
 GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
 The 1993 Adelanto General Plan includes nine (9) elements: Land Use,
 Housing, Circulation, Parks and Recreation, Conservation/Open Space,
 Noise, Safety, Public Facilities, and Community Design. This Housing
 Element is consistent with the General Plan’s policies and proposals. For
 example, the Housing Element draws upon the Land Use Element to
 determine the appropriate locations for affordable housing development.
 The City will ensure consistency between the Housing Element and the
 General Plan, and as new policies are introduced, they will be coherent
 with the existing elements. If any General Plan elements are updated, the
 Housing Element can also be modified to maintain consistency within the
 General Plan.
 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
 Section 4553(c)(6)(B) of the Government Code states, “The local
 government shall make diligent effort to achieve public participation of
 all economic segments of the community in the development of the
 housing element, and the program shall describe this effort.” This
                   Page 6

                            City of Adelanto Housing Element
process not only includes residents of the community, but also
coordinates participation among local agencies and housing groups,
community organizations, and housing sponsors. In the preparation of
the Housing Element Update, a number of organizations and agencies
that provide housing, or housing related services, were contacted.
Stakeholder groups that have been identified as influential to the
development of housing and the provision of services in the community
are:
     Adelanto Senior Citizens Club
     American Cancer Society
     Assistance League of Victor Valley
     Boys and Girls Club
     Desert Communities United Way
     High Desert Domestic Violence Program
     High Desert Youth Center
     Hope Healthcare
     House of God Worship Center
     Lighthouse Support Services
     Mojave Basin Youth Corps Inc
     New Hope Family Church
     Shenanigans Youth Theatre Group
     Victor Valley College Foundation
     Victor Valley Community Hospital Foundation
     Victor Valley Domestic Violence
     Victor Valley Toys for Tots
     VVEDA
     Southern California Logistics Airport
     Inland Agency Community Tool Box
     Housing Authority of San Bernardino County
     Inland Fair Housing and Mediation Board
     San Bernardino County Office of Aging and Adult Services
     National Community Renaissance
     California Housing Partnership Corporation
     Southern California Association of Non-Profit Housing
The City held three workshop meetings prior to the submittal of this
Housing Element draft to HCD for review. The first two meetings with
the Planning Commission took place September 3rd, and September 10,
2013 and was intended to provide Commissioners and the public with
general information regarding the Housing Element (i.e. contents, process
and information on the RHNA). At this meeting the main concern
regarding the Element was to ensure that selected affordable housing
sites were located near job opportunities and services appropriate for
lower income households. This comment was taken into consideration
                                            Page 7

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 and consequently many of the sites are located near the city center. A
 second workshop with the City Council occurred on September 25, 2013
 and was focused more on the specific sections included in the draft
 Housing Element update (i.e. the Housing Plan, Land Inventory and
 technical background reports.) At this meeting council members
 expressed that the sites should be located throughout the city and that
 they felt strongly that there should not be a concentration of lower
 income households in any one area. For both meetings the Housing
 Element workshop was noticed in the local paper, at City Hall, at the
 Library and in other public places.
 In addition to the public meetings held in September, the public was
 invited to review the Draft Housing Element prior to the initial Planning
 Commission and City Council Meeting. The Draft Housing Element was
 available for public review on the City’s website and at the City’s main
 counter beginning September 10, 2013.

2. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
   The Housing Needs Assessment provides the foundation for the
   objectives, policies, and programs to address housing needs in the City of
   Adelanto.      This assessment addresses population characteristics,
   employment patterns, and income levels. The information illustrates how
   Adelanto has grown and changed, and identifies patterns and trends
   relevant to housing policies and programs. Projections show how the
   community demographics are expected to change over the coming years.
   The following sources were used to generate this demographic and
   housing profile of Adelanto:
        U.S. Bureau of the Census (2000 and 2010)
        Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
        San Bernardino County Association of Governments (SANBAG)
        California State Department of Finance
        2011 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS)
        American Community Survey
        Various other sources
   Data from the Census Bureau’s yearly American Community Survey was
   used, as it is available for Adelanto and many other small jurisdictions.
   The City recognizes that 2010 U.S. Census data may not wholly reflect
   conditions in Adelanto in 2013, so the American Community Survey was
   used regularly throughout this evaluation.
   Utilizing estimates for demographic data shows changes in conditions
   since the 2010 U.S. Census. However, many of these estimates (such as
   the California Department of Finance data) are shown solely as
   percentages. The raw numbers carry a significant margin of error
   especially for smaller geographic areas such as counties or cities.
   Nonetheless, the percentages presented give a general indication of
   population and employment trends.
   Additional information is drawn from the 2011 Comprehensive Housing
   Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data, which is drawn from Census 2010
   data. CHAS data is based on special tabulations from sample Census
   data. Thus, the number of households in each category often deviates
   slightly from the 100% count due to extrapolations to the total household
   level. Because of this, interpretations of CHAS data focus on proportions
   and percentages, rather than on precise numbers.
                                                Page 9

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 It should be noted that the City of Adelanto was included in the U.S.
 Census 2011 American Community Survey as the City’s relatively small
 population puts it in the 3 year survey for areas with a population of
 20,000 or more;. Additionally, the California Department of Finance’s
 2011 Population and Housing Estimates are provided when possible.
 These estimates do not provide detailed population and housing
 characteristics in the same manner as Census data. Data in this document
 is based primarily on Census 2010 data, as this is the most up-to-date
 information available for Adelanto.
 POPULATION TRENDS
 Adelanto has experienced steady population growth over the past two
 decades, as has most of the High Desert. In order to meet the future
 housing needs of the growing population it is important to analyze the
 current housing and population trends for the City of Adelanto. To
 clarify the type of housing that will be needed to meet anticipated future
 demand, Housing Element law requires an assessment of population and
 employment trends.        Characteristics such as age, ethnicity, and
 employment influence the type and cost of housing needed or in high
 demand. Tracking demographic changes helps the City better plan for,
 respond to, and anticipate changing housing demand.
 POPULATION GROWTH
 According to the 2010 Census, the population of Adelanto was 31,765
 persons. In 2012, the State Department of Finance estimated a population
 of 31,066, which represents a small decrease. The growth rate is
 deceiving somewhat because of the down turn in the economy and
 housing market. In fact, for the City of Adelanto, projected population
 growth by decade, from 1980 to 2030, ranges from 6,400 to 13,600
 residents, with an average population growth of 10,400 people per
 decade. This steady rate of growth is attributable to the increase in
 housing construction in the city caused by the outward migration of
 individuals and families from more expensive and congested regions of
 Southern California.
 In 2012, of the 23 incorporated cities and towns in San Bernardino
 County, Adelanto is the eighth smallest city in the county, based on
 Department of Finance estimates. Compared to other cities in the High
 Desert, Adelanto had the smallest population of 31,066 in 2012. The
 neighboring City of Victorville has a population of 119,059 and the City of
 San Bernardino, with a population of 211,674 is the largest city in the
 county.

Like many cities in the inland areas of Southern California, Adelanto has
seen steady population growth in the past 20 years and will continue to
grow as jobs and housing opportunities continue to expand. Housing in
Adelanto continues to be more affordable than in other Southern
California communities, this has fueled the steady population growth
within the city. The Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) indicates that by 2025, one in four SCAG residents will live in the
Inland Empire compared to one in ten Southlanders who lived in the
inland valleys and desert areas in the 1950s .
The population in Adelanto has grown consistently since incorporation in
1970.     Between 1980 and 1990, the city’s population grew by
approximately 6,400 people, between 1990 and 2000, the population grew
by 9,600 people and between 2000 and 2010, the population grew by
13,635. The steady increase in growth over the past 30 years is primarily
attributable to increases in single-family home construction.

 Future growth estimates predict a continued increase in population over
 the next 20 years. The Southern California Association of Governments
 estimates that the population of Adelanto will exceed 60,000 by the year
 2030. This represents a population growth of approximately 29,000
 people, or an approximate yearly average of 1,460 people. This average
 annual population increase is consistent with the average population
 increase Adelanto experienced between 2000 and 2010.
 AGE DISTRIBUTION
 The age distribution of a population is also an important factor in
 evaluating housing needs. The traditional assumption is that in many
 communities young adults tend to prefer apartments, low- to moderate-
 cost condominiums, and smaller or more affordable single-family units,
 while mature adults provide demand in the market for moderate- to
 high-end condominiums and single-family homes. The senior population
 (65 years and older) tends to generate demand for low- to moderate-cost
 apartments and condominiums, community residential settings, and
 mobile homes.
 San Bernardino County as a whole can be characterized as having a
 young population. Among Southern California counties, San Bernardino
 has the youngest median age at 30.2 years (compared with Los Angeles,
                     Page 12
                              City of Adelanto Housing Element
Orange, Riverside, San Diego and Ventura counties). Adelanto is
representative of this characteristic with a median age in 2000 of 26.9 and
in 2010 of 25.3 as demonstrated in Table 3 (Population Age Characteristics
City of Adelanto 2000 and 2010). Just over 41 percent of Adelanto’s
population is under 19 years of age. Almost one third of the total
population is school age residents (ages 5-19), while only 4 percent of the
population is older residents (65 years +). Between 2000 and 2010, the
median age decreased slightly to 25.3.

 HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
 Household type and size, income level, the presence of persons with
 special needs, and other household characteristics may affect access to
 and demand for housing and housing programs. This section details the
 various household characteristics in Adelanto.
 HOUSEHOLD TYPE AND SIZE
 A household is defined by the Census as all persons occupying a housing
 unit. Families are a subset of households and include all persons living
 together who are related by blood, marriage or adoption. Single
 households include persons living alone in housing units, but do not
 include persons in group quarters such as prisons, convalescent homes or
 dormitories.       Non-family households are unrelated people living
 together, such as roommates.
 The number of families increased by approximately 2,740 or 71 percent
 between 2000 and 2010 as shown in Table 5. In 2010, family households
 comprise of 84 percent of household types. Families headed by single
 parents made up 22 percent of all households. Adelanto’s average
 household size increased to 3.84 in 2010.

Household composition and size are often two interrelated factors.
Communities with a large proportion of families with children tend to
have a large average household size. Such communities have a greater
need for larger units with adequate open space and recreational
opportunities for children. Adelanto’s average household size in 2000
was 3.69 and in 2010 was 3.84. The County average household size was
3.15 in 2000 and 3.26 in 2010.
INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT
Household income is the most important, although not the only factor,
affecting housing opportunity because it determines a household's ability
to purchase or rent housing, and to balance housing costs with other
necessities. Income levels can vary considerably among households,
affecting preferences for tenure, location, and housing type. While
higher-income households have more discretionary income to spend on
housing, low and moderate-income households have a more limited
choice in the housing they can afford.
In 2010, the median household income in Adelanto was estimated at
$40,000; this was lower than the San Bernardino County median
household income of $53,969. Household income is an important
consideration when evaluating housing conditions because lower
incomes typically constrain people's ability to obtain adequate housing.
Income in Adelanto varied significantly for different types of households
indicating that specific family types will have greater need for affordable
housing and housing services. For example, families with a married
couple have a much higher median income $55,389 than families headed

EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
Adelanto residents are employed in diverse industries, with the largest
percent of the population employed in the educational, health and social
services sector, with 20 percent. The second most common sector to work
in is manufacturing, with over 19 percent of the residents employed in
this sector. Retail trade ranks third, with 12.4 percent of residents
working in retail. This sector is important to consider when assessing
housing affordability, as salaries tend to be lower, which decreases the
amount of income available for housing. The retail sector also generally
does not offer health and other employment benefits, further increasing
economic strain.

ELDERLY
The elderly population (generally defined as those over 65 years of age)
has several concerns: limited and fixed incomes, high health care costs,
transit-dependency, and living alone. Specific housing needs of the
elderly include affordable housing, supportive housing (such as
intermediate care facilities), group homes, and other housing that
includes a planned service component.
The Census estimates that Adelanto’s proportion of elderly population
has increased considerably in recent years. In 2000, Adelanto’s elderly
composed 5.1% of the population and 14.2% of the population in 2010.
Many elderly persons have limited income potential, as they are most
often retired and have fixed income (retirement funds and Social Security
Income). The elderly population in 2010 had a median income of $20,729,
according to the U.S. Census, which is considered low income by HCD
standards. The 2004 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy
(CHAS) report revealed that more than one-third of seniors paid more
than 35 percent of their income for housing, experiencing a housing cost
burden. While the vast majority of seniors are homeowners, the
percentage of senior renter who overpaid was much higher than the
average; more than half of senior renters overpay for housing.
In 2010, over two-thirds of the elderly population was disabled. Despite
the large number of seniors who have disabilities, almost half of the
                                              Page 19

 elderly population lives alone, according to the U.S. Census. The vast
 majority of elderly own their home, estimated at 67 percent in 2010.

 Programs including assisted care, shared housing, and housing
 rehabilitation assistance can help seniors live comfortably. Because 67
 percent of the elderly in Adelanto own their own homes, there is a
 growing need for elderly assisted living care centers. Currently there are
 no assisted living care centers for seniors in Adelanto
 LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
 In general, large households (with five or more members) are identified
 as a group with special housing needs based on the limited availability of
 adequately sized, affordable housing units. Large households are often of
 lower income, frequently resulting in the overcrowding of smaller
 dwelling units and in turn, accelerating unit deterioration. The 2010
 Census estimates that nearly a third of Adelanto households (27 percent)
 are large households.
 The existing housing stock in Adelanto provides large families with a
 variety of options. The Census estimated in 2010 that over 55 percent of
 the housing units in Adelanto contained 3 or more bedrooms. The vast
 majority of these units are owner-occupied (74 percent).
 Correspondingly, the majority of large-families are homeowners, 63
 percent in 2010. Because of the large number of large units, the existing
                  Page 20
                             City of Adelanto Housing Element
housing stock likely could meet the needs of the city’s large-families,
though affordability (both price and availability of mortgage financing)
issues may limit the accessibility of these units to very low-income large
families.
FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance
because of the greater need for day care, health care, and other facilities.
Female-headed households with children in particular tend to have lower
incomes, thus limiting housing availability for this group. The 2010
Census revealed that of the 1,858 female-headed households with
children under the age of 18 in Adelanto, over 50 percent were living in
poverty. As described previously in the income section, female-headed
households with children had a median income of $15,276, classified as
very-low income making only 38 percent of the area median income for a
family of four.
DISABLED RESIDENTS
Both mentally and physically disabled residents face housing access and
safety challenges. Disabled persons may face difficulty in finding
accessible housing (housing that is made accessible to people with
disabilities through the positioning of appliances and fixtures, the heights
of installations and cabinets, layout of unit to facilitate wheelchair
movement, etc.).
In Adelanto, nearly 31 percent of residents were identified as disabled in
the 2010 Census. The age group in which disabilities are most common is
seniors above age 65. However, the age group of 18 to 64 also has a
sizable portion of the population with a disability. This age group is
especially important as it includes almost all of the working population,
and disabilities may often affect a person’s ability to work consistently
and regularly.

 The U.S. Census defines and estimates the number of persons with six
 categories of disabilities:
     Sensory disability: blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing
       impairment
     Physical disability: a condition that substantially limits one or more
       basic physical activities such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching,
       lifting, or carrying
     Mental disability: a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting
       six months or more that made it difficult to perform activities such
       as learning, remembering, or concentrating
     Self-care disability: a physical, mental, or emotional condition
       lasting six months or more that made it difficult to perform certain
       activities such as dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the
       home
     Going-outside-the-home disability (also known as mobility
       disability): a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting six
       months or more that made it difficult to go outside the home alone
       to shop or visit a doctor’s office (tallied only for residents over 16
       years of age).
     Employment disability (also known as work disability): a physical,
       mental, or emotional condition lasting six months or more that made
       it difficult to work at a job or business (tallied only for residents
       between 16 and 64 years of age).
 In Adelanto, the most common disability is physical disability,
 accounting for 23 percent of total disabilities revealing limited mobility
 for nearly a quarter of people with disabilities (see Table 11). Sensory
 disability was the second most common disability, Many people with
 disabilities have multiple disabilities that often fall into separate
 categories. Because of this, disabled persons must often consider a
 variety of complex factors when attempting to find adequate housing.

The City of Adelanto complies with the Federal Lanterman
Developmental Disabilities Services Act, which provides that state-
authorized, licensed community care facilities serving six or fewer
persons be permitted by right in all residential zones. There are currently
six (6) licensed community care facilities in Adelanto, with the capacity to
serve 36 individuals (see Table 12).

FARM WORKERS
The 2010 Census revealed 21 Adelanto residents have occupations in the
farming, forestry, and fishing industry. The low number of farm workers
is due to the lack of farming related land uses in Adelanto. As such, the
City does not have a need for farm worker-specific housing. The City
allows affordable housing in all residential zones, therefore affordable
housing needs of people within the “Farming, Forestry, and Fishing”
occupations can be accommodated.
HOMELESS
Homelessness can be triggered by a variety of factors including mental
illness, family violence, severe and sudden economic burdens, and
housing costs. In 2013, the Community Action Partnership (CAP) of San
Bernardino County published the results of a daily canvass of the County
to assess the number of homeless persons on the streets and in emergency
shelters. The San Bernardino County 2013 Homeless Census and Survey
estimated the point in time (daily) number of homeless residents in San
Bernardino County to be 2,321 persons. The CAP homeless census
revealed 9 homeless persons in Adelanto (see Table 13).

 Another sector of homeless that are much less visible than those in
 shelters and on the streets is the informal homeless sector. These people
 are much harder to enumerate, as they stay with friends and relatives, in
 motels and other informal housing arrangements. It is likely that an even
 larger number of individuals and families that fall into this category, but
 estimates are unavailable.
 HOUSING PROFILE
 This section addresses characteristics of the housing supply in Adelanto,
 including type, age, condition, and availability.
 HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
 The Census Bureau defines a housing unit as a house, an apartment, a
 mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or, if
 vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate
 living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any
 other individuals in the building and which have direct access from
 outside the building or through a common hall.
 HOUSING GROWTH
 Housing growth has steadily increased over the past five years. The
 number of housing units in Adelanto constructed between 2008 and 2013
 totaled 689, showing an 8% increase over the five-year span (See Table
 14). New development in Adelanto is expected to increase the housing
 stock further over the next 5-15 years.

HOUSING TYPE
The housing stock composition in Adelanto has remained stable since
2000. Single-family detached houses are the principal housing type in the
City (73 percent) and multi-family units make up 20 percent of the total
housing units (see Table 15). Seven percent of the housing units in
Adelanto are mobile homes, which have filled an affordable housing
niche in the city for years. As land values rise, however, the land on
which mobile homes are standing have increased the likelihood of being
sold and redeveloped.

AGE OF HOUSING STOCK
The age of housing is commonly used as a measure of when housing may
begin to require repairs. In general, housing units over 30 years old are
likely to have rehabilitation needs, including new roofing, foundation
work, and new plumbing. In 2000, the median year built for housing
units in the City was 1991 (see Table 16). Only 23 percent of Adelanto’s
housing stock was built prior to 1980, and is likely to need major
rehabilitation in the near future. The majority of units in the city have
                                                  Page 25

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 been constructed since 1980 with the largest number of units constructed
 between 1990 and 1999.

 TENURE
 Tenure in the housing industry typically refers to the occupancy of a
 housing unit – whether the unit is owner-occupied or renter-occupied. A
 number of factors influence tenure preferences including household
 income, composition, age of the household occupants, mobility, and
 housing costs. The tenure distribution (owner versus renter) of a
 community’s housing stock influences several aspects of the local housing
 market. Residential mobility is influenced by tenure, with owner-
 occupied housing having a much lower turnover rate than rental housing.
 In 2000, Adelanto’s housing stock was predominantly owner-occupied,
 similar to the County as a whole (see Table 17).
 Tenure change in Adelanto between 1990 and 2000 displays an interesting
 trend. In 1990, renters occupied the majority of housing, at 70 percent,
 and owner-occupancy was at 30 percent. In 2000, the distribution
 displayed an inverse relationship, with owner-occupied at 64 percent,
 and renter-occupied at 36 percent. It remains the same for 2010.

VACANCY
Housing vacancy rates, the number of vacant units compared to the total
number of units, reveal the housing supply and demand for a city. Some
amount of housing vacancy is normal, to allow for moving time and
changing locations.        According to the US Census and the State
Department of Finance, the housing vacancy rate has increased from
approximately 4.83 percent, between 1990 and 2000, to a vacancy rate of
15.55 percent in 2007 and 16.10% in 2011 (see Table 18).

In December of 2008, the City of Adelanto Code Enforcement division
conducted a field survey on vacant single-family residential lots. City
staff reported 954 vacant units. This equates to a 14.5% vacancy rate,
consistent with the State Department of Finance. This high vacancy rate
is attributed to the increased foreclosure activity and has placed
downward pressure on the cost of housing in Adelanto.
HOUSING ISSUES
HOUSING CONDITION
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) was
developed by the Census for HUD. It uses Census data to evaluate
housing issues affecting different groups, including elderly and large
families (see Table 19). CHAS identified the following housing issues in
Adelanto:
                                                Page 27

                     Severe Housing Cost Burden, including utilities, greater than 50
                      percent of household income
                     Housing Cost Burden, including utilities, between 30 and 50 percent
                      of household income
                     Overcrowded conditions (homes with more than one person per
                      room, excluding kitchens and hallways)
                     Units with physical problems or lack of suitable conditions (lacking
                      plumbing facilities, for example)
                 In general, renters in Adelanto (62 percent) are more likely than owners
                 (36 percent) to experience housing cost burden or other housing
                 problems. However, extremely low income (with incomes less than 30
                 percent of the MFI) renter households are more likely than owner
                 households to experience a cost burden (50 percent and 36 percent
                 respectively), and more low-income households rent than own.
                 CHAS data also reveals that over half (56.1 percent) of Adelanto
                 households are extremely low, very low, or low income, earning less than
                 80 percent of the MFI. Of these households, almost three quarters (71.9
                 percent) experienced one or more housing issues, especially housing cost
                 burden.

FORECLOSURE RATES
Foreclosure is a process by which lenders sell or take ownership of a
property because the homeowners have defaulted on their loan. The
foreclosure process begins after a homeowner has not paid for three
consecutive months, and the lender files a public Notice of Default, or Lis
Pendens. The process proceeds in one of four ways:
1.  The homeowner pays the default amount during a given grace period
2.  The homeowner sells the home to another party
3.  The home is placed on public auction
4.  The lender takes possession of the house
Foreclosure rates have been on the rise nationally. California is one of the
leading states with 142,429 foreclosure filings in 2006. The “foreclosure
rate” is the number of foreclosure filings of any kind divided by the
number of households in the subject area. San Bernardino County has
seen a particularly high rate of foreclosures. There are a reported 4,357
foreclosure fillings during the first quarter of 2007. The national
foreclosure rate was one in 92 households, and California’s foreclosure
rate was one in 86 households.

As noted previously, in December of 2008, the City of Adelanto Code
Enforcement division conducted a field survey on vacant single-family
residential lots. City staff reported 954 vacant units. This equates to a
                                             Page 29

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 14.5% vacancy rate, fairly consistent with the State Department of
 Finance. This high number has been attributed to the high foreclosure
 rate.
 Unfortunately, many households losing their homes are the low-income
 families that “predatory lenders” target. Denied conventional home
 loans, their only avenue may have been the “sub-prime” credit market.
 Sub-prime loans are characterized by higher interest rates and fees than
 prime loans, and are more likely to include prepayment penalties. These
 “predatory lenders” typically offer to refinance an existing loan with one
 that is filled with excessive or unnecessary fees and usually provides no
 tangible benefit to the borrower. These loans also often include
 adjustable rate mortgages with steep built-in rate and payment increases
 and more onerous prepayment penalties – and are usually approved with
 little or no income documentation required.
 Some homeowners are able to emerge from the foreclosure process
 without losing their homes by refinancing, selling the home, or becoming
 current with payments in another way. According to a DataQuick news
 release in April 2007, 40 percent of California homeowners that were
 engaged in the foreclosure process during 2006 lost their homes during
 the first quarter of 2007, up from only 9 percent the year prior. When
 households lose their home through foreclosure it is likely they will seek
 rental housing and this may result in a higher demand for rental units.
 Although, many of these foreclosed homes are being purchased by
 investors as rental properties, with rents that are often less than the
 mortgage payment on predatory loans.
 OVERCROWDING
 Overcrowding occurs when housing costs are so high relative to income
 that families have to live in small units or double up to devote income to
 other basic needs such as food or medical care. However, cultural
 differences also contribute to the overcrowded conditions since some
 cultures tend to have larger household size than others due to a
 preference for living with extended family members. The federal
 government defines an overcrowded household as one with more than
 one person per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and
 porches. Severely overcrowded households are households with greater
 than 1.5 persons per room. By these definitions, approximately 25
 percent of households in Adelanto live in overcrowded conditions in
 2010. Generally, low-income families are disproportionately affected by
 overcrowding. Overcrowding is also more prevalent among renters than
 among owners.          Adelanto households in renter-occupied units
                   Page 30

                              City of Adelanto Housing Element
experienced overcrowding and severe overcrowding at a significantly
higher proportion than households in owner-occupied units. (see Table
21).

HOUSING COST BURDEN
State and federal standards specify that a household experiences a
housing cost burden if it pays 30 percent or more of its gross income on
housing. Housing cost burden typically is linked to income levels and
occurs when housing costs increase faster than income.
In Adelanto, housing cost burden is more prevalent among renters than
owners. In 2010, the Census estimated that approximately three-quarters
(73 percent) of renter households paid 30 percent or more of their gross
income on housing. In owner-occupied housing units, cost burden was
experienced by 55 percent of the households. Again, this burden was
more often felt by lower-income households, with approximately three-
quarters (73 percent) of households with incomes less than $35,000
paying more than 30% of their income on housing.
Low-income households are those that make less than 80 percent of the
median income. The median income for a family of four in San
Bernardino County is $59,200. As such, households (with four members)
making less than $47,350 per year are considered lower income. Table 22
below reveals that lower income households are significantly more likely
to experience housing cost burden than higher income households.
Overall, approximately 960 renter households and over 840 owner
households experienced housing cost burden in 2010. According to the
HUD Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (2010), almost all
rental households (810 households) experiencing housing cost burden
were lower income (0-80% MFI), and over 700 lower income owners paid
more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs.

  Source: US Census 2007-2011 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates *Notes:
  State and federal standards specify that a household experiences a housing cost burden if
     it pays 30 percent or more of its gross income on housing. Renter-Households not
           computed are 9%; Owner-Households not computed are less than 1%.
 SUBSTANDARD HOUSING CONDITIONS
 A variety of housing conditions can cause a home to be considered
 substandard. These homes often require extensive renovation to make a
 home safe. The number of homes that are likely to need major
 renovations can be estimated by looking at the percentage of older
 housing units and Census reports of residents regarding their housing
 conditions.
 Because over 1,200 units (23 percent) will be more than 30 years old by
 2012, rehabilitation needs may be more likely. The older residential
 neighborhoods in Adelanto are likely to require the most significant
 rehabilitation, including seismic reinforcement in addition to
 maintenance and repairs. Additionally, the likelihood of homes with lead
 paint hazards increases for those built before 1980, especially in lower
 income households.
 In regards to substandard housing, the City of Adelanto’s code
 enforcement identified two multi-family complexes that are substandard.
 The first is located at 11200 Vintage Road, and is an 18-unit complex. The
 second complex located at 18414 Jonathan Street, is a 30-unit

development (Desert View Apartments). A private entity has applied for
Government Bonds to purchase and rehabilitate the Desert View
Apartments. The project was completed in 2011.
OWNERSHIP HOUSING COST
Over 60 percent of households in Adelanto live in owner-occupied
dwellings, with 73 percent of the housing units being single-family
residential units. The Adelanto median home price between July of 2013
was $128,000, which is 57 percent lower than in 2007. The median home
price for the neighboring cities of Apple Valley, Hesperia and Victorville
were $145,000, $151,750, and $153,000 respectively.

RENTAL HOUSING COST
Several Multi Family Residential units are available for rent. A survey of
the ten apartment properties within the City was prepared in September
of 2013. Of those apartments with available units, the median rent for a
three-bedroom apartment was $685. Median rents for two-bedroom units
were $624 and one-bedroom units were $537.

 MOBILE HOMES
 Mobile homes are manufactured off-site and installed on either a
 residential lot or in a rented location such as a mobile home park. This
 type of housing typically provides an alternative to higher cost housing
 types. However, the cost is often difficult to quantify, as sales are not
 often recorded in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS). According to the
 U.S. Commerce Department’s Census Bureau, the average cost for a new
 manufactured home in the United States in 2008 was $62,100. The data
 was further separated by region, and in the Western United States, the
 average price for a new mobile home was $84,400. This does not
 accurately represent the mobile home market, as the transfer of older
 mobile homes happens frequently and prices can range as low as $10,000
 (based on listings dated April 15, 2009).

HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
Income Levels and Affordable Housing Payments
Housing affordability levels are determined by the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) and divided into the
following categories:
    Extremely Low Income = income less than 30 percent of area
     Median Family Income (MFI)
    Very Low Income = income greater than 30 percent, and less than 50
     percent MFI
    Lower Income = income greater than 50 percent, and less than 80
     percent MFI
    Moderate Income = income greater than 80 percent, and less than
     120 percent MFI
The California Health and Safety Code section 50052.5, provides the
following definition of affordable housing cost based on income level:
                                Table 25

 Very Low (31-50% MFI)             30% of 50% AMI      30% of 50% AMI
 Lower (51-80% MFI)                30% of 70% AMI      30% of 60% AMI
 Moderate Income (81-120% MFI)     35% of 110% AMI     30% of 110% AMI
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
conducts an annual household survey to determine MFI and related
income amounts for low-income groups. Housing affordability for
various levels of income can be determined by estimating the costs of
owning or renting a home, including utilities, applicable taxes or
insurance, in addition to the monthly payment on a mortgage or to a
landlord (see Table 26).

 HOUSING AFFORDABILITY INDEX
 The citywide median home price of $128,000 (July 2013) puts affordable
 homeownership in reach for all low and some very low-income
 households. Of the 172 homes sold between September 1st, 2008 and
 March 1st, 2009, 75 homes were sold below the price of $101,270. This
 equates to 44% of the homes sold at market rate are within reach of very-
 low income families.
 ASSISTED HOUSING IN ADELANTO AT RISK OF
 CONVERSION TO MARKET RATE HOUSING
 State housing law requires an inventory and analysis of government-
 assisted dwellings units eligible for conversion from lower income
 housing to market rate housing during the next ten years. Reasons for
 this conversion may include expiration of subsidies, mortgage
                         Page 36
                            City of Adelanto Housing Element
prepayments or pay-offs, and concurrent expiration of affordability
restrictions.
A review of the assisted housing inventory maintained by HUD indicated
that no assisted units subject to expiration of affordability restrictions are
located within the City of Adelanto. Consequently, no analysis of costs
and programs for preserving such units is necessary.
There are two affordable housing developments located within the City:
1) Desert Gardens Apartments, located at 1125 Lee Avenue, and 2) Oasis
Village Apartments.
The Desert Gardens Apartments provides a total of 81 affordable units; 56
units are set aside as very low-income units (31 – 50 percent MFI) and 25
units are low income (51 – 80 percent MFI). Financing for the project
includes Low Income Tax Credits, which places an affordability
restriction on the property for a total of 30 years from the project’s
completion date, 2004, which means that the project will remain
affordable for another 25 years. Further, the property is owned and
operated by a non-profit organization, lowering the risk that it would be
converted to market rate at a later date.
Oasis Village Apartments provides a total of 81 units, 17 units are set
aside as low-income units (51 – 80 percent MFI). Financing for the project
includes Low Income Tax Credits, which places an affordability
restriction on the property for a total of 30 years from the project’s
completion date, 2007. The project is operated under the Affordable
Housing Program under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Therefore, prospective renters must adhere to criteria and income
guidelines in order to qualify for residence. Applicants with Section 8
vouchers may also apply for residence.
ESTIMATES OF HOUSING NEED
Several factors influence the degree of demand, or "need," for housing in
Adelanto. The four major needs categories considered in this element as
shown in Table 27, include:
    Housing needs resulting from population growth, both in the City
      and the surrounding region;
    Housing needs resulting from the overcrowding of units;
    Housing needs that result when households pay more than they can
      afford for housing; and
                                             Page 37

City of Adelanto Housing Element
     Housing needs of "special needs groups" such as elderly, large
      families, female-headed households, households with a disabled
      person, farm workers, and the homeless.

 PROJECTED HOUSING NEED
 The California Department of Housing and Community Development
 (HCD) determined that the projected housing need for the Southern
 California region (including the Counties of Los Angeles, Orange,
 Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, and Imperial) was 412,137 new
 housing units. The Southern California Association of Governments
 (SCAG) allocated this projected growth to the various cities and
                   Page 38

                               City of Adelanto Housing Element
unincorporated county areas within the SCAG region, creating the
Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). The RHNA is divided
into four categories: very low, low, moderate, and above moderate
income. As determined by SCAG, the City of Adelanto’s fair share
allocation is 2,841 new housing units during this planning cycle, 2014-
2021 (see Table 28). To calculate Adelanto’s projected housing needs, the
City assumed 50 percent of its allocation of housing units for very low-
income households should be affordable to extremely low-income
households. As a result, from the very low-income need of 633 units, the
City has a projected need of 317 units for extremely low-income
households.

3. HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Pursuant to State law, each jurisdiction is responsible for a share of the
region’s projected housing needs. To meet these needs, the jurisdiction
ensures that it addresses local constraints that may impede the
development, improvement, and conservation of housing for persons of
all income levels and for persons with special needs (such as the
homeless, disabled, and elderly). Should constraints be identified, the
jurisdiction must demonstrate its efforts in removing or mitigating the
constraints, where appropriate and legally possible.
MARKET CONSTRAINTS
The production and availability of housing may be constrained by
government regulations and by non-governmental factors, such as the
costs of construction and interest rates on home mortgages.
                                                  Page 39

 DEVELOPMENT COSTS
 Typically high development costs in Southern California can affect
 potential affordable housing developments. These costs are attributed to
 several factors, including a high growth rate, housing demand, and
 limited land availability. Adelanto, however, has a substantial supply of
 relatively low cost land suitable for development. When developed, land
 values are reflected in home prices.
 One significant cost factor associated with residential construction is the
 cost of building materials, which can comprise a significant portion of the
 sales price of a home. An indicator of construction costs is Building
 Valuation Data compiled by the International Code Council (ICC). The
 unit costs compiled by the ICC include structural, electrical, plumbing,
 and mechanical work, in addition to interior finish and normal site
 preparation. The data is national and does not take into account regional
 differences, nor does the data include the price of the land upon which
 the buildings are built. The national averages for costs per square foot
 unit of apartments and single-family homes are as follows:
     Type I or II, Multi-Family: $111.73 to $126.43 per sq. ft.
     Type V Wood Frame, Multi-Family: $86.28 to $90.83 per sq. ft.
     Type V Wood Frame, One and Two Family Dwelling: $94.06 to
       $99.79 per sq. ft.
     Residential Care Facilities: $109 to $150 per sq. ft.
 While these costs have minimal flexibility, other costs of development
 including land and soft costs, such as entitlements, and permits are lower
 in Adelanto when compared to surrounding cities.
 Manufactured housing (including both mobile homes and modular
 housing) may provide for lower priced housing by reducing construction
 and labor costs. The cost per square foot of a mobile home ranges from
 $45 to $55.       A modular single family dwelling typically costs
 approximately 85 percent of what a typical wood-frame dwelling would
 cost.
 The price of land can also be a significant component of housing
 development costs. Land costs may vary depending on whether the site
 is vacant or has an existing use that must be removed. Similarly, site
 constraints such as environmental issues (steep slopes, soil stability,
 seismic hazards, or flooding) all factor into the cost of land. The City of
 Adelanto does not have the constraints of other cities in Southern
 California. The geography of the land is typically flat, with a gentle slope
                   Page 40

                            City of Adelanto Housing Element
downward in the northeasterly direction. Additionally, the City has
developed only 10% of their land inventory, showing that land
constraints are not an issue as they are in many other Southern California
cities. Current land costs in Adelanto are consistent with land costs in the
neighboring cities of Victorville, Hesperia and Apple Valley (see Table
29).

 LAND AVAILABILITY
 The cost of land directly influences the cost of housing. In general, land
 prices in San Bernardino County are more affordable than the Los
 Angeles and Orange County markets; in fact, the lack of inexpensive
 residential land in Los Angeles and Orange Counties is a major impetus
 for development in the High Desert. Accordingly, Adelanto, along with
 other cities within San Bernardino County, are providing affordable
 housing for workers in Orange County and Los Angeles County.
 Within the San Bernardino County market, there are also significant
 differences in land prices. Cities closer to Los Angeles County such as
 Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga and Upland generally garnered
 considerably higher residential land prices than communities in the
 Victor Valley Area.
 CONSTRUCTION COSTS
 Construction costs are the total costs to developers exclusive of profit, but
 including fees, materials, labor and financing. Construction costs for
 housing can vary significantly, depending on the type of housing, such as
 single-family detached homes, townhomes, and multiple-family
 apartments.        However, even within a particular building type,
 construction costs vary by unit size and amenities. Furthermore,
 neighborhood resistance to some developments lengthens development
 time, driving up the holding costs. The difficulty of developing awkward
 infill sites can also add to costs. The permitted residential uses within the
 SF residential zoning districts are primarily low-density single-family
 detached units.        Development Plan approval for higher density
 development may also add to costs.
 The cost of labor is based on a number of factors, including housing
 demand, the number of contractors in an area and the unionization of
 workers, but it is generally two to three times the cost of materials. Thus,
 the cost of labor represents an estimated 17% to 20% of the cost of
 building a unit, which is a substantial portion of the overall cost of
 construction.
 In the State of California, all projects utilizing public funds must pay
 prevailing wages to all workers employed on the project. This includes
 any residential or commercial project that is funded federal funds or
 assisted residential projects controlled or carried out by an awarding
 body. The prevailing wage rate is the basic hourly rate paid on publicly
 funded projects to a majority of workers engaged in a particular craft,
                     Page 42
                            City of Adelanto Housing Element
classification, or type of work within the locality and in the nearest labor
market area.
Twice a year, prevailing wage rates are determined by the director of the
California Department of Industrial Relations. A prevailing wage ensures
that the ability to get a publicly funded contract is not based on paying
lower wage rates than a competitor, and requires that all bidders use the
same wage rates when bidding on a publicly funded project. The
California Department of Industrial Relations provides link to the current
prevailing wages for a journeyman craft or classification for each county
in California. Prevailing wages may constrain construction of affordable
housing because they are often higher than normal wages.
INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL
Residential construction cost estimates established by the International
Code Council (ICC) in January 2013 indicate average costs of labor and
materials between $97.29 and $145.89 per square foot for multifamily
residential depending on the type of construction.             Single-family
residential costs range between $107.08 and $137.67 per square foot,
depending on the type of construction. Construction costs may vary
based on the type of material used, location of development, structural
features present, and other factors.
The data indicates that construction costs in the Adelanto vicinity can
constitute approximately 40% of the cost of a single-family detached
housing unit. These figures are even more noteworthy considering that
the cost of raw land constitutes only four to 14% of the cost of a housing
unit. Typically, in the private sector market, the development of
residential units is a business and investment venture. Therefore,
developers seek the greatest return for their investment. As with most
businesses, a constraining factor in the area of profitability continues to
be the market place where developers sell their products. To a great
extent, the market place sets the upper end of the profit margin with
overhead costs for construction constituting the lower parameter of
profit.
The construction cost of housing affects the affordability of new housing
and can be a constraint to the creation of affordable housing in the City
and greater San Bernardino County region. Particularly with the
tightening of mortgage lending standards and increases in current rates,
homebuilders may be slowing down on the construction of new homes,
which could potentially affect the provision of affordable housing. A
reduction in construction costs can be brought about in several ways.
One such method involves a reduction in amenities and quality of
                                             Page 43
City of Adelanto Housing Element
 building materials in new homes (still above the minimum acceptability
 for health, safety and adequate performance), which may result in lower
 sales prices. State Housing Law provides that local building departments
 can authorize the use of materials and construction methods if the
 proposed design is found to be satisfactory and the materials or methods
 are at least equivalent to that prescribed by the applicable State building
 codes.
 AVAILABILITY OF MORTGAGE AND REHABILITATION
 FINANCING
 The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or
 improve a home; the cost of borrowing money for residential
 development is incorporated directly into the sales price or rent. Interest
 rates are determined by national policies and economic conditions, and
 there is virtually nothing a local government can do to affect these rates.
 Jurisdictions can, however, offer interest rate write-downs to extend
 home purchasing opportunities to a broader economic segment of the
 population. In addition, government-insured loan programs are an
 option available to some households to reduce mortgage requirements.
 Under the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending
 institutions are required to disclose information on the disposition of loan
 applications and the income, gender, and race of loan applicants. The
 availability of financing for a home greatly affects a person’s ability to
 purchase a home or invest in repairs and improvements.
 As shown in Table 30, a total of nearly 28,760 households applied for
 conventional mortgage loans to purchase homes in the Riverside-San
 Bernardino-Ontario MSA during 2011, of which Adelanto is a part. The
 data includes purchases of one- to four-bedroom homes, as well as
 manufactured homes. Close to 52 percent of the loan applications were
 received from households that reported their income as above moderate
 income (earning greater than 120 percent of Median Family Income
 [MFI]). Moderate-income households (80 to 120 percent of MFI) and
 lower-income households (less than 80 percent MFI) accounted for 21
 percent and 24 percent, respectively. More than half of the applications
 were originated (approved by lenders and accepted by applicants) and
 nearly 14 percent were denied, with the remaining 21 percent of the
 applications withdrawn, closed for incompleteness, or not accepted by
 the applicants (see Table 30). As expected, the denial rate was lowest for
 the moderate- and upper-income groups.

Origination rates can be expected to contract further, as a recent national
survey conducted by the Federal Reserve found that 60 percent of banks
responding reported they had tightened their lending standards or
eliminated subprime mortgages. Additionally, 40 percent of responding
banks said they had tightened lending standards for prime mortgages for
people with the best credit records, while none reported easing
standards.
Government-backed lending represents a significant, although
underutilized, alternate financing option for Adelanto residents. Only
35,720 Riverside/San Bernardino-area households applied for
government-backed lending in 2011 (see Table 31). Surprisingly, many
lower-income households took advantage of government-backed lending
such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the denial rate for low-income
applicant households was higher than that for moderate- and upper-
income applicants. Usually, low-income households have a much better
chance of getting a government-assisted loan than a conventional loan.
However, the recent lending market offered other loan options such as
zero percent down, interest-only, and adjustable loans. As a result,
government-backed loans have been a less attractive option for many
households.

 Interest rates substantially affect home construction, purchase, and
 improvement costs. A fluctuation in rates of just 2.5 percent can make a
 drastic difference in the annual income needed to qualify for a loan. In
 the recent past, Adelanto and the country as a whole have experienced
 interest rates at historically low levels, enabling many households to
 purchase a home. These rates have risen over the past few years, and
 many households – particularly households with adjustable rate
 mortgages - have realized that they are unable to pay new mortgage
 rates. However, as the Federal Reserve lowered rates in late 2007/early
 2008, refinancing is again becoming an option. Even so, the availability
 and cost of capital required for pre-development costs for new housing,
 such as land purchase option money and project design and entitlement
 processing, as well as uncertainty in the larger housing market, remain a
 deterrent to development in general and of affordable housing in
 particular.
 GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
 Local policies and regulations can affect the price and availability of
 housing and in particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use
 controls, site improvement requirements, fees and exactions, permit
 processing procedures, and other factors can constrain the maintenance,
 development, and improvement of housing.
 State and Federal regulations, which the City has no control over, also
 affect the availability of land for housing and the cost of producing
                     Page 46

                              City of Adelanto Housing Element
housing. Regulations related to environmental protection, building
codes, and other topics have significant, often adverse, impacts on
housing cost and availability. While constraints may exist at other levels
of government, this section emphasizes policies and regulations that can
be controlled by the City.
LAND USE CONTROLS
The Adelanto General Plan goals and policies guide residential
development. The Land Use Element has the most direct influence on
residential development by specifying the amount, location, type and
density of residential development. The zoning ordinance reinforces the
objectives of the Land Use Element by regulating development densities,
housing types, and development standards in residential zones.

City of Adelanto Housing Element
  The City currently operates on a “one-map system”, in which the General
  Plan Land Use Map serves as the zoning map as well. Therefore, the land
  use zoning districts shown in Table 32 directly conform to the respective
  land use designations.
  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
  The City of Adelanto Zoning Code sets forth regulations that determine
  the size, type, density, and scale of residential development. Such
  regulations are designed to promote the health, safety, and general
  welfare of residents; preserve the character and integrity of
  neighborhoods; and implement General Plan goals and policies. State
  law has also focused increasingly on how residential development
  standards affect the feasibility of the building market rate and affordable
  housing. Table 33 describes the established standards for developing
  new housing, including density ranges, building heights, yards, and open
  space.

  The residential development standards are considered standard for a
  suburban community. They are not identified as a constraint to the
  development of affordable, market rate or housing for special needs
  groups. While these densities and development standards in more urban
  communities may not accommodate development typical of most
  affordable housing, due to the lower sales price for homes in the City and
                       Page 48

     the availability of land for development, compared to the region as a
     whole, affordable housing can be accommodated at these lower densities.
     With the creation of the new High Density Residential and Mixed Use
     zones, the City will be able to provide additional opportunities for the
     development of affordable housing. Given that the current development
     standards for existing lower density zones do not constrain affordable
     housing development, it is not expected that the new higher density
     zones will have development standards that create constraints.
     Table 34 lists the allowed location of specific uses. Key provisions
     include:
         Single-family homes are permitted by right in all residential zones,
           excluding the Mobile Home Park (MHP) zone.
         Multiple family dwellings are only permitted by right in the R3-8
           and R3-30 zones.
         Mobile home Parks are allowed in the MHP zones, and are
           conditionally permitted in the Desert Living zones.
         Residential Care facilities (with 6 or fewer people) are permitted by
           right in all residential zones.
         Large Residential Care facilities are conditionally permitted uses in
           all residential zones.

    Manufactured housing is permitted by right on all lots which permit
    single-family houses, pursuant to State law. The City will revise their
    Land Use Matrix to be consistent with State Law.
    PARKING
For many jurisdictions, particularly urban areas, parking requirements is
often a constraint to the development of affordable housing. The City’s
parking standards typically require a two-car garage or other covered
parking for each residential unit, ranging from single-family units to multi-
family units, condominiums, and townhouses. The standards require
parking based on the type of unit, in addition to guest parking requirements
(multi-family and Mobile home Park uses) (see Table 35). The provision of
parking consistent with City regulations has not historically constrained the
development of affordable housing due to low land costs. However, the
current parking standards do not specifically address residential uses for
special needs groups and seniors. To address these unique groups, the City
will offer alternative parking standards, such as a reduction in the number of
requirement spaces, when appropriate to ensure that the development of
residential units is not constrained.
To encourage affordable housing, reduced parking requirements consistent
with State law can be achieved through the density bonus process.
According to California Government Code Section 65915, if a project qualifies
for a density bonus, because it is a senior project or provides affordable
housing, a local jurisdiction—at the request of a developer—may reduce the
required parking for the entire project, including the market rate units, to the
following:
         Zero to one bedroom – one on-site parking space
         Two or three bedrooms – two on-site parking spaces
         Four or more bedrooms – two and one-half on-site parking spaces.

 Adelanto’s location in the High Desert has historically dictated that all
 housing units must provide garages as the exposure to sun and wind is
 difficult on vehicles. Developers have expressed to the City that
 financially providing garage spaces in comparison to carports or
 alternative types of parking spaces is not cost prohibitive and makes
 housing more desirable to households of any income level. While the
 City’s parking requirements could be viewed as a constraint to the
 construction of multifamily affordable housing, the City offers developers
 the option to utilize a density bonus which provides for deviations to the
 parking standards. The City is also willing to work with developers to
 promote the development of affordable units through the modification of
 development standards. The City of Adelanto is determined and
 historically has been successful in addressing specific development
 constraints and has created Program 12 to ensure that any residential
 development standards that may constrain the future development of
 affordable housing are removed.
 OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS
 To improve the living environment of residential neighborhoods,
 communities typically require housing to have a certain amount of open
 space, such as yards, common space, and landscaping. For a single
 family home, open space is reflected in setbacks, yard sizes, and lot
 coverage requirements.           Multi-family developments (duplexes,
 condominiums, townhouses, and apartments) are also required to have
 dedicated open space in lieu of private yards.
 Multi-family developments with 10 or more dwelling units must provide
 a minimum of 500 square feet of a combination of private and common
 usable open space per unit. Private open space, including private patios,
 decks, or balconies can be determined to contribute to the required
 recreational and leisure areas and must meet the following dimensions:
                                                 Page 51

City of Adelanto Housing Element
      A minimum of 350 square feet of common open space per unit
      A minimum of 150 square feet of private open space per unit
 Minimum open space requirements are considered standard for suburban
 communities in Southern California and do not act as a constraint in
 housing development. The maximum density for a residential zone is
 thirty (30) units per acre. At this density the open space requirement can
 still be achieved, and should not be a constraint to development.
 SITE IMPROVEMENTS
 Development in Adelanto requires site improvements that vary by size
 and location. For new development on unimproved sites, the City
 requires the developer to construct on-site improvements and contribute
 to its fair share of off-site improvements. These improvements may
 include, but are not limited to, reservation of sites for public parks and
 trails, landscaping, irrigation, exterior lighting, storm water drainage,
 streets and roads and vehicle and pedestrian access including curb cuts.
 Site improvements are required to ensure that there is adequate structure
 and access to a site. Site improvements also help in making the project
 more compatible with surrounding neighborhoods.
 On- and off-site improvements are generally provided directly by
 developers when building a new subdivision and are regulated by the
 Subdivisions Ordinance (Title 16) of the Municipal Code. Specifically,
 Chapter 16.04.060 specifies the improvement requirements to be
 performed and fees to be collected prior to approval of the final map.
 Typical requirements include:
         City standard street widths (curb-to-curb): Local Street – 44-60
          feet; Collector Street – 44-60 feet; Major Collector – 64-80 feet;
          Major Arterial– 86-100 feet
         Streetlights, traffic signals and street trees
         Drainage and water system facilities
 The local street and local collector street classifications are the typical
 requirement for housing development in the City. Most of the City’s on-
 and off-site improvements are provided through the payment of fees,
 which have been accounted for under development fees. Outside of
 subdivision development, new development under established zones
 pays its prorated share for on/off-site improvements, if found to be
 required, as a part of the standard fee schedule.
                    Page 52

                            City of Adelanto Housing Element
The City recognizes that improvements can create barriers to the
development of affordable housing. When possible, the City has
indicated that they will grant money or other available funding, when
available, to offset the cost of on- and off-site improvements in order to
assist affordable housing developers in the production of units. The City
will also consider deviations to these standards, including the narrowing
of streets within planned communities. Site improvements currently
required by the City are necessary and have not been determined to
constrain the development of affordable housing.
DENSITY BONUS
Consistent with State law, developers in Adelanto can receive density
bonuses of 20 to 35 percent, depending on the amount and type of
affordable housing provided, and concessions or exceptions from
normally applicable zoning and other development standards (See Table
36). Two projects have used the City’s density bonus provision. The
Desert Garden Apartments located at the northwest corner of Lee Avenue
and Bellflower Street was completed in 2004, and provides a total of 81
very low and low-income units. Oasis Village located at the northeast
corner of Lee Avenue and Bellflower Street, completed in 2008, provides
a total of 17 low-income units.
                                 Table 36
                        Density Bonus Opportunities
                                         Minimum % of
                                           Affordable
                  Group                        Units      Bonus Granted
  Very Low-Income                                5%             20%
  Lower-Income                                  10%             20%
  Senior Citizen Housing Development           N/A              20%
Developers can receive a density bonus with additional incentives, which
include concessions, or exceptions from normally applicable zoning or
other development standards such as the reduction of site development
standards or zoning code requirements, direct financial assistance, or
other regulatory incentives. Developers can also receive equivalent
financial incentives; i.e. monetary contributions based upon a land cost
per dwelling unit value equal to a density bonus and an additional
incentive, or a density bonus, where an additional incentive is not
requested or is determined to be unnecessary.
MULTIPLE FAMILY UNITS
In previous years, single-family residences have been permitted in multi-
family residential zones at a lower density. Some of the land zoned for
multi-family use may not be developed to its full potential.
                                             Page 53

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 In order to encourage affordable multi-family ownership housing, the
 City has a condominium conversion provision that establishes criteria for
 the conversion of multi-family rental units to ownership units. The City
 has established standards and criteria for converting multi-family
 dwellings, including dwelling units in a rental manufactured housing
 park, to residential condominium, stock cooperative, and community
 apartment types of ownership. The standards and criteria promote
 affordable housing and design quality.
 SECOND UNITS
 Second units are permitted by right in all residential zones that permit
 single-family homes as consistent with State law.
 EMERGENCY AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING
 An emergency shelter is a facility that provides temporary shelter for the
 homeless, for up to six months. Transitional housing facilitates the
 movement of homeless individuals and families to permanent housing.
 Typically, transitional housing provides for up to two years of stay and is
 combined with supportive services that help the residents gain
 independent living skills.
 Allowable locations for emergency and transitional housing are based on
 the residential use of the facility, not the population these developments
 serve. To facilitate the development of emergency housing and comply
 with State law, the City’s development code has been amended
 concurrently with this Housing Element to permit Group Homes,
 Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing, and Homeless Shelters by
 right in the DL zoning District and ensures that a proposed shelter is
 subject to only the same development standards required for other uses
 permitted in the zone. The DL zone consists of DL 2.5, DL 5, and DL 9
 and encompasses approximately 3,300 vacant acres within the City
 boundary. DL 2.5 allows for single-family dwelling units on a minimum
 of 2.5 acres. DL 5 allows for single-family dwelling units on a minimum
 of 5 acre lots and DL 9 allows for single-family dwelling units on a
 minimum of 9 acre lots. These zones allow for residential use and can
 accommodate larger facilities such as Group Homes, Emergency Shelters,
 Transitional Housing and Homeless Shelters and their related service
 facilities. Larger lots allow for adequate parking, service facilities, animal
 keeping, agriculture, and numerous other uses that can be used to train,
 educated and service the occupants of these types of facilities. Other
 services such as, water, sewer, electricity roads and transit can be
 provided upon development.
                    Page 54

                            City of Adelanto Housing Element
Group Homes, Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing, and Homeless
Shelters can also be located in the Light Manufacturing and
Manufacturing Industrial zones with a conditional use permit. Figure 4
indicates the potential sites in the city that could accommodate an
emergency shelter if one is proposed.
The Light Manufacturing and Manufacturing Industrial zones are
appropriate to accommodate emergency shelters as they are typically
located along major arterial roadways with access to employment centers
and near stores and other services.
State law allows for small transitional housing serving six or fewer people
to be considered a regular residential use and permitted in all zones
where residential uses are permitted. The City allows Transitional
Housing of six or fewer people in all residential zones. Transitional
housing for more than seven people and operated as a residential care
facility can be conditionally permitted in residential zones. The City has
amended their zoning code to address transitional housing serving seven
(7) or more individuals.

 COMMUNITY RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES AND HOUSING WITH
 SUPPORTIVE SERVICES
 Pursuant to State law, Adelanto’s residential care facilities for elderly and
 group homes serving six or fewer persons are considered a permitted
 residential use in all residential districts. The City’s Land Use Matrix is
 consistent with state law.
 In a supportive housing development, housing is coupled with social
 services such as job training, alcohol and drug abuse programs, and case
 management for populations in need of assistance, such as the homeless,
 those suffering from mental illness or substance abuse problems, and the
 elderly or medically frail.
 FARM WORKER HOUSING
 As indicated in the Community Needs Assessment (page 16), only 0.30%
 of Adelanto residents hold “farming, forestry, and fishing” occupations,
 according the 2010 Census. The City does not have an agriculture zone.
 The Zoning Code permits Caretaker’s Residence uses in the MHP
 residential districts. This use is defined as “a dwelling unit accessory to
 the principal use on a site which is intended for occupancy by a caretaker,
 security guard, worker, or similar person generally requiring residence
 on the site”. This complies with the State Employee Housing Act (Section
 1700 of the Health and Safety Code) that allows employee/farm worker
 housing in zones that allow agricultural uses.
 DEVELOPMENT FEES AND EXACTIONS
 Adelanto charges planning fees to process and review plans for
 residential projects and also charges development impact fees to ensure
 that infrastructure and facilities are in place to serve the projects.
 Development fees that apply to residential development in Adelanto are
 substantially low relative to most areas in southern California. The City
 has designed its fees to recoup City costs associated with review and
 approval of proposed projects while not unduly constraining the financial
 feasibility and development of market rate and affordable housing. In
 addition, to Development Services Department fees, the San Bernardino
 County Fire Department also requires development review fees.
 A comparative analysis shows that Adelanto has planning review fees
 comparable to and in some cases lower than neighboring jurisdictions
 (Certificate of Compliance, Minor Variance, and Planned Unit
 Development – Modifications Only applications). Adelanto’s planning

      The City has also adopted development impact fees for the improvement
      of infrastructure and public facilities. These fees are shown in Table 38.

      The full extent of required planning and impact fees are listed above and
      provide a worst case scenario for new single and multifamily
      development. The maximum amount a developer would pay in
      development impact fees for a single family home is around $18,000 and
      $15,500 for a multifamily unit. This may be higher than some jurisdictions
      where infrastructure is more readily available however, due to the City’s
      location in San Bernardino County, the low cost of land, materials and
      labor help to offset the cost of any development impact fees.
      There is little difference in the impact fees for single family versus
      multifamily units due to the amount of vacant land, the availability of
      infrastructure, and the current low cost of housing in the City.
      Developers have expressed to City Staff that based on the low cost of land
      and materials in the High Desert it is as cost effective to construct single
      family homes, which are more desirable and easier to sell/rent over a
      multifamily complex. Because City fees are lower than actual costs and
      lower than many other San Bernardino County cities, they do not act as a
      constraint to development.

DEVELOPMENT REVIEW AND PERMIT PROCESSING
Development review and permit processing are necessary steps to ensure
that residential construction proceeds in an orderly manner. However,
the time and cost of permit processing and review can be a constraint to
housing development if they place an undue burden on the developer.
For major entitlement applications, including tentative tract and parcel
maps,) planned unit developments, specific plans, conditional use
permits, zone change or General Plan amendments—the development
review process can typically take between approximately 4 – 5 months to
complete, including Planning Commission and City Council public
hearings. Minor development review cases typically take less than 30
days for review and approval. Although no constraints have been
identified, the City will continue to assess policies, procedures, and fees
to ensure that unnecessary delays or expenses to projects do not occur.
A typical review process for a single-family home requires only a $305
Single Family Home development fee and is a streamlined process that is
typically complete within 30 days.
For a multifamily residential project the permitting procedure can be
more complex and consequently can result in longer and more variable
processing times. For a multifamily development with six or more units
the development review process requires approval by the Planning
Commission. Upon submitting an application and development plans,
the project is reviewed by the Development Review Committee (DRC)
initially for completeness and then to determine if any conditions of
approval including required improvements are necessary to complete the
project. Conditions of approval typically protect the health, safety and
welfare of the public and ensure a project’s consistency with established
architectural design guidelines.
Upon completing their review any conditions of approval are sent to the
applicant. At the applicant’s request a meeting can be scheduled to
discuss the conditions of approval if necessary. If the applicant
understands and accepts the DRC’s findings and conditions the project is
sent as a public hearing item before the Planning Commission. Findings
and conditions do not exceed the limits and requirements of the State
law. Any finding or conditions are provided primarily to ensure that the
project is consistent with the City’s General Plan, the Zoning Code and
Health and Safety codes. Typical findings for multi-family housing
projects include; analysis of street improvements, fire suppression, and
water quality. In most cases a project would then be approved by the
Planning Commission and permits would be issued soon after. These
review times are typical of surrounding jurisdictions and are designed to
                                            Page 59

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 accommodate development. The City’s development review and
 permitting process, as well as their processing times, have not been
 identified as a constraint to the development of affordable housing.
 As noted in Program 12 the City will continue to monitor the permitting
 process and address procedures to ensure that they do not become a
 constraint to the development of affordable housing. The City will
 continue to offer a stream lined permitting process on a case by case basis
 for projects that promote the development of affordable units. Projects
 that accommodate units for extremely low income households and very
 low households will be prioritized to receive this form of development
 concession from the City.
 LAND USE REVIEW
 Projects such as a General Plan Amendments, Zone Changes, and Specific
 Plans are subject to discretionary approval by the City, and require a
 public hearing and review by the Planning Commission and a public
 hearing and review by the City Council.
 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
 Uses requiring a conditional use permit (CUP) are required to
 substantiate the following findings:
     1. That the proposed Conditional Use is consistent with the General
         Plan;
     2. That the nature, condition, and development of adjacent uses,
         buildings, and structures have been considered, and that the use
         will not adversely affect or be materially detrimental to these
         adjacent uses, buildings, or structures;
     3. That the site for the proposed conditional use is of adequate size
         and shape to accommodate the use and buildings proposed;
     4. That the proposed conditional use complies with all applicable
         development standards of the zoning district; and
     5. That the proposed conditional use observes the spirit and intent of
         this Zoning Code.
 These requirements are the same for all uses subject to CUP approval.

                             City of Adelanto Housing Element
SITE REVIEW
Normally a site plan is required before construction can take place. In
order to obtain approval, preliminary plans are submitted to determine
the discretionary action necessary. Site plan approval is required
whenever a new residential structure is proposed. Prior to the approval,
formal plans are submitted and routed to various City departments to
determine the necessary conditions for approval for on- and off-site
improvements. Improvements are discussed in more detail later in the
development process on a project-by-project basis. Once approved by a
public hearing body, construction drawings are required prior to building
permit issuance. Once permits are issued, inspections are conducted by
appointment at the request of the applicant.
BUILDING CODE AND ENFORCEMENT
The City of Adelanto uses several uniform codes as the basis for its
building standards, including the 2010 California Building Code, the
Uniform Fire Code, and the 2010 California Electrical Code. No
restrictions or amendments have been adopted that would constrain the
development of housing. Enforcement of building code standards does
not constrain the production or improvement of housing in Adelanto, but
instead serves to maintain the safety and condition of the City’s
structures and neighborhoods.
The City utilizes its code compliance powers in a manner that does not
constrain housing development or improvement. The Code Compliance
Divisions’ mission is to proactively and reactively inspect low and
moderate-income housing throughout the City of Adelanto. The officers
inspect electrical, plumbing, mechanical, weather protection, trash and
debris, fire protection equipment, overall property maintenance, and
other habitability standards. These inspections will assist in preserving
housing stock for low and moderate-income within the City of Adelanto.
The officers will also maintain the clean-up of blighted and graffiti areas,
working in conjunction with the local law enforcement agency to improve
the quality of life within the City.
HOUSING FOR DISABLED PERSONS
State law requires localities to analyze the potential and actual constraints
upon housing for persons with disabilities, demonstrate efforts to remove
governmental constraints, and include programs to accommodate
housing designed for people with disabilities. The City has no special
                                              Page 61

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 zoning or land use restrictions that regulate the siting of housing for
 persons with disabilities.
 In accordance with State law, cities must permit state-licensed residential
 care facilities serving six or fewer persons in all of its residential zoning
 districts by right. In Adelanto, small family day care homes, serving 6 or
 less individuals are permitted in all residential districts. The following
 housing types for persons with disabilities are conditional uses, requiring
 a CUP:
     Residential Care Facilities serving 7 or more are conditionally
       permitted in the Desert Living (DL-2.5, DL-5, and DL-9), Medium
       Density Residential (R3-8), Airport Park (AP), General Commercial
       (C), Card Room (CR2), Commercial Restricted (CR), and Public
       Facility (PF) districts; and are subject to California Department of
       Social Services.
     State-licensed large family day care homes (serving nine or more
       persons) are conditionally permitted in all residential districts.
     Group homes are conditionally permitted in the MI and LM zoning
       districts and permitted in the DL zoning district.
 To accommodate disabled persons in public facilities, the City defers to
 Title 24 of the California Handicap Accessibility Code. As stated
 previously, the City has adopted the 2010 California Building Code,
 which is consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act. No local
 amendments that would constrain accessibility or increase the cost of
 housing for persons with disabilities have been adopted.
 DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
 A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss
 the housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. As defined
 by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic
 disability of an individual that:
        Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination
         of mental and physical impairments;
        Is manifested before the individual attains age 18;
        Is likely to continue indefinitely;
        Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the
         following areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and
         expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f)
         capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency;
                    Page 62

                             City of Adelanto Housing Element
       Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of
        special, interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized
        supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or
        extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the
U.S. Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate
of the percentage of the population that can be defined as
developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. This equates to 476 persons in
the City of Adelanto with developmental disabilities, based on the 2010
Census population.
According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services, as of
November 2013, at least 284 Adelanto Residents with developmental
disabilities were being assisted at the Developmental Center and
Regional Center. Most of these individuals were residing in a private
home with their parent or guardian and 157 of these persons with
developmental disabilities were under the age of 18.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work
independently within a conventional housing environment. More
severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where
supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may
require an institutional environment where medical attention and
physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist
before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living
situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
Resources
The most obvious housing need for persons with disabilities is housing
that is adapted to their needs. Most single-family homes are inaccessible
to people with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing may not be
adaptable to widened doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger
bathrooms, lowered countertops, and other features necessary for
accessibility. Location of housing is also an important factor for many
persons with disabilities, as they often rely upon public transportation to
travel to necessary services and shops. “Barrier free design” housing,
accessibility modifications, proximity to services and transit, and group
living opportunities are important in serving this group. Incorporating
barrier-free design in all new multi-family housing is especially
important to provide the widest range of choices for the disabled.
State and federal legislation mandate that a specified number of units in
new or rehabilitated multi-family apartment complexes be accessible to
                                             Page 63

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 individuals with limited physical mobility. The City offers flexibility in
 development standards for projects proposing housing affordable to
 seniors and persons with disabilities. In addition, a number of residential
 care facilities are located in Adelanto to accommodate persons with
 disabilities (see Table 12)
 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
 The Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, requires that cities and
 counties provide reasonable accommodation to rules, policies, practices,
 and procedures where such accommodation may be necessary to afford
 individuals with disabilities equal housing opportunities. While fair
 housing laws intend that all people have equal access to housing, the law
 also recognizes that people with disabilities may need extra tools to
 achieve equality. Reasonable accommodation is one of the tools intended
 to further housing opportunities for people with disabilities. For
 developers and providers of housing for people with disabilities who are
 often confronted with siting or use restrictions, reasonable
 accommodation provides a means of requesting from the local
 government flexibility in the application of land use and zoning
 regulations or, in some instances, even a waiver of certain restrictions or
 requirements because it is necessary to achieve equal access to housing.
 Cities and counties are required to consider requests for accommodations
 related to housing for people with disabilities and provide the
 accommodation when it is determined to be “reasonable” based on fair
 housing laws and the case law interpreting the statutes.
 State law allows for a statutorily based four-part analysis to be used in
 evaluating requests for reasonable accommodation related to land use
 and zoning matters and can be incorporated into reasonable
 accommodation procedures.         This analysis gives great weight to
 furthering the housing needs of people with disabilities and also
 considers the impact or effect of providing the requested accommodation
 on the City and its overall zoning scheme. Developers and providers of
 housing for people with disabilities must be ready to address each
 element of the following four-part analysis:
     The housing that is the subject of the request for reasonable
       accommodation is for people with disabilities as defined in federal
       or state fair housing laws;
     The reasonable accommodation requested is necessary to make
       specific housing available to people with disabilities who are
       protected under fair housing laws;
                    Page 64

                              City of Adelanto Housing Element
    The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial
      or administrative burden on the local government; and
    The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental
      alteration in the local zoning code.
Adelanto does have a process for making requests for reasonable
accommodation to land use and zoning decisions at this time. The Fair
Housing Act, as amended in 1988, requires that cities and counties
provide reasonable accommodation to rules, policies, practices and
procedures where such accommodation may be necessary to afford
individuals with disabilities equal housing opportunities. The process for
making requests for reasonable accommodation to land use and zoning
decisions and procedures regulating the siting, development and use of
housing for people with disabilities falls under the authority of the
Planning Director. The Planning Director or designee can allow
projections into setback areas for ramps, lifts and the like for disabled
persons. These projects can be approved over the counter and only
require the applicants to obtain building permits. Funding may be
available through County, State or Federal resources.
PROVIDING FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING TYPES
Title 17 of the City’s Municipal Code is the Adelanto Zoning Ordinance,
which contains the basic standards that allow for the development of a
variety of housing types. Title 17 development standards are considered
standard for suburban communities in San Bernardino County and
Southern California and do not impede the ability to develop housing at
appropriate densities. The Permitted Use Table lists the allowed location
of specific uses. To better facilitate the understanding of housing types
permitted in zones in the City, a matrix of approved uses in residential
zones was incorporated, September 25, 2013 into the comprehensively
updated Title 17.
SENIOR CITIZEN HOUSING
The City of Adelanto does not have any specific regulations for the
development of senior citizen housing. At this time, senior citizen
housing is subject to the same regulations and process as any residential
development. Per State law (Government Code Section 65915), density
bonuses are provided for senior citizen housing developments.
                                            Page 65

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 SINGLE-ROOM OCCUPANCY FACILITIES
 Single-room occupancy (SRO) buildings house people in single rooms,
 with tenants often sharing bathrooms and kitchens. SROs are not
 specifically identified in Title 17, the Adelanto Zoning Ordinance. To
 comply with State law the City will amend their Zoning Ordinance to
 address SROs.
 SUPPORTIVE HOUSING
 In a supportive housing development, housing can be coupled with social
 services such as job training, alcohol and drug abuse programs, and case
 management for populations in need of assistance, such as the homeless,
 those suffering from mental illness or substance abuse problems, and the
 elderly or medically frail. A supportive housing development in the form
 of a residential care facility serving six or fewer persons is treated as a
 residential use, consistent with State law. Current regulations in Title 17,
 the Adelanto Zoning Ordinance, do address supportive housing. To
 comply with State law the City has amended their Zoning Ordinance to
 comply with State law.
 INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
 The lack of necessary infrastructure or public services can constrain
 residential development in a community by increasing costs and reducing
 the amount of land suitable for housing. There is a lack of adequate
 infrastructure—namely roads, sewer, and water—in certain portions of
 Adelanto that may serve as a constraint to the development of housing.
 As demonstrated in the Existing Sewer Facilities map in the Public
 Facilities Element of the General Plan, sewer and water facilities are
 generally available within the central and southern portions of the City.
 The City has identified housing sites in areas that are anticipated to
 become new growth corridors along future major roadways, including
 Highway 395, El Mirage Road and Palmdale Road. As these roadways are
 established the City anticipates the development of infrastructure to
 occur simultaneously. The City has also identified a core growth area to
 serve, essentially as a growth boundary to ensure that development
 occurs in a responsible and feasible manner and that infrastructure can be
 developed to support new housing and commercial development. It is
 not anticipated that infrastructure will be a constraint to the development
 of affordable housing units.

DRAINAGE
The City of Adelanto is affected by two major drainage areas, of which,
the Baldy Mesa Drainage area is the most significant, affecting the most
densely populated area of the City. It encompasses 86 square miles
immediately south of the City and about 75 percent of the existing and
incorporated City limits and sphere of influence area.
At present, the City does not have an extensive drainage system in place.
Drainage improvements are constructed on a project-by-project basis
according to the approved 1985 Master Plan and 1994 General Plan.
Scattered development in the City has created a somewhat piecemeal
drainage system. As development occurs within the City, the drainage
system will be completed through the utilization of development impact
fees, thus, eliminating any gaps that may exist and reducing any potential
drainage problems. There are currently drainage facilities available to
serve the Housing Opportunity sites. It is not anticipated that drainage
facilities will be a constraint to the development of affordable housing.
SEWER SERVICES (WASTEWATER)
 The City of Adelanto is currently the owner and operator of their own
sewer treatment plant and associated sewer pipeline facilities. The
facility has the capacity to treat up to 4 million gallons a day (MGD) of
effluent. Current flow estimates indicate that existing development
within the City generates 2.1 MGD of effluent. The City has currently
completed a 2.5 million gallons per day upgrade that has increased
wastewater treatment capabilities to 4.0 million gallons per day which
can accommodate the City’s combined RHNA allocation. It is not
anticipated that sewer/wastewater facilities will be a constraint to the
development of affordable housing.
WATER
The current water demand for the City of Adelanto based upon the
consumption for 2013 is 2,004,000,000 gallons of water. The City
currently has the ability to produce approximately 2.25 billion gallons of
water per year based upon yields from their current water sources.
The Water Department must adhere to strict water quality requirements
established and enforced by the California Department of Public Health
(CDPH) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
                                              Page 67

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 The Adelanto Water Department is committed to providing a high
 quality, safe, and adequate supply of water to meet current and future
 expected demands. The Water Department Master Plan is updated
 periodically and includes strategies for the future. Since approximately
 99% of the residents receive their water from the public water supply, the
 Master Plan is a crucial tool to ensure a safe and adequate water supply
 for the next ten years and beyond. The plan outlines activities such as the
 identification and development of future well sites, rehabilitation and
 upgrades to the existing system to maximize operations, and supporting
 water resource conservation and protection initiatives. The 1994 General
 Plan indicates that the City has the capacity to more than accommodate
 the combined RHNA allocation and in many areas infrastructure either
 exists or could be extended. Other on-going programs include a fire
 hydrant flushing program and water meter replacement program. It is
 not anticipated that the provision of water will be a constraint to the
 development of affordable housing.
 SOLID WASTE
 The City of Adelanto has adopted the San Bernardino County Solid
 Waste Management Plan. This is in accordance with Section 65302 of the
 California Government Code that requires solid waste management to be
 addressed in a City’s adopted General Plan and that it must be consistent
 with the goals of the adopted San Bernardino County Waste Management
 Plan. It is not anticipated that the disposal of solid waste will be a
 constraint to the development of affordable housing.
 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
 Environmental factors can constrain residential development in a
 community by increasing costs and reducing the amount of land suitable
 for housing construction. Environmental constraints to residential
 development typically relate to the presences of sensitive biological
 resource habitat or geological hazards.
 FLOODING
 The Safety Element in the 1994 General Plan identifies those areas of the
 City that are subject to periodic flooding. The Federal Emergency
 Management Agency (FEMA) has prepared Flood Insurance Rate Maps
 (FIRM) for the City of Adelanto and the unincorporated areas. In order to
                   Page 68

                             City of Adelanto Housing Element
mitigate potential flooding the City refers to the San Bernardino County
Flood Control District Master Drainage Plan and requires private
development to design drainage systems according to this plan.
The most costly constraint tied to flooding is the requirement to get a
permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, or California State Department
of Fish and Game if the property is adjacent to or modifying a drainage
wash which is deemed to be under the definition of “waters of the United
States.” This permit can take months to process from each department. In
addition, the entire project may need to be altered to prevent the loss or
damage of the drainage area. None of the potential affordable housing
sites identified in Figure 5 are located in a designated floodplain.
GEOLOGY, SOILS, AND SEISMICITY
Like the entire Southern California region, Adelanto is located in an area
of high seismic activity. The probability of a major earthquake from the
San Andreas, Helendale, and the San Jacinto Faults is possible. No faults
or fault traces are known or suspected to exist within the planning area
and, as a result, no Alquist-Priolo Special Housing Studies Zones are
located within the planning area. However, because of the high
probability of seismic activity, consistent with Seismic Safety Zone IV of
the California Code, new development is required to employ design and
construction techniques that will reduce the potential for loss of life,
injury, and property damage in the event of a major earthquake. These
requirements add to the cost of building residential structures. None of
the potential affordable housing sites identified in Figure 5 are located
near identified faults in special seismic study zones.
BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Alluvial fans and floodplains support distinctive scrub vegetation within
Adelanto, containing an assortment of plants characteristic of Mojave
creosote bush scrub, Mojave wash scrub, and Joshua tree woodland
communities. Such areas are known habitat for a variety of wildlife,
including the desert tortoise and Mojave ground squirrel. Mojave
riparian forest habitat is found along the Mojave River, as well as in some
of the natural drainage courses throughout the City. A variety of animal
species may use the stream courses as a movement corridor.
The City of Adelanto is within the California Desert Conservation Area,
which is managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). A portion
of the northernmost part of Adelanto is within the Desert Conservation
Area Plan’s “Western Mojave Desert” critical habitat area. The City of
                                               Page 69

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 Adelanto is also subject to the California Desert Native Plant Act
 (CDNPA; California Flood and Agriculture Code, 1986).                   The
 identification of these resources within the City are not considered to be a
 constraint to the development of affordable housing as the City has
 plenty of land outside of the California Desert Conservation Area that is
 vacant and available for development.
 OTHER CONSTRAINTS
 DISADVANTAGED UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES
 According to SB 244 Cities and Counties are required to determine if they
 have disadvantaged island or fringe communities within their sphere of
 influence. If no island or fringe communities are present, no further
 review is required.
 The City of Adelanto has several unincorporated areas within its sphere
 of influence which could be considered disadvantaged communities if
 there were 10 or more dwellings units in close proximity to one another.
 None of the three unincorporated sphere of influence areas have
 communities with 10 or more dwellings in close proximity to one
 another. Although the areas are inhabited; dwellings are scattered
 throughout. No further review is required.

4. HOUSING RESOURCES AND
   OPPORTUNITIES
   This section summarizes the land, financial, and administrative resources
   available for the development and preservation of housing in Adelanto.
   The analysis includes an evaluation of the availability of land resources
   for future housing development; the City’s ability to satisfy its share of
   the region’s future housing needs, the financial resources available to
   support housing activities, and the administrative resources available to
   assist in implementing the City’s housing programs and policies.
   REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
   (RHNA)
   The fair share allocation process begins with the State Department of
   Finance’s projection of statewide housing demand for a five year period,
   which is then apportioned by HCD among each of the State’s official
   regions. The regions are represented by an agency typically termed a
   Council of Government (COG). In the six county southern California
   region, which includes Adelanto and all other incorporated cities and
   unincorporated areas of San Bernardino County, the agency responsible
   for assigning these fair share housing goals to each jurisdiction is the
   Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).
   A local jurisdiction’s “fair share” of regional housing need is the number
   of additional dwelling units that will need to be accommodated during a
   given eight-year planning period. SCAG estimates each jurisdiction's
   future housing need in terms of four factors:
            1) The number of units needed to accommodate forecasted
               household growth;
            2) The number of units needed to replace demolitions due to
               attrition in the housing stock (i.e., fire damage, obsolescence,
               redevelopment and conversions to non-housing uses);
            3) Maintaining an ideal vacancy rate for a well-functioning
               housing market; and
            4) An adjustment to avoid an over-concentration of lower-
               income households in any one jurisdiction.
                                                Page 71

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 The new construction need must be allocated to four household income
 categories used in Federal and State programs: very low, low, moderate,
 and above moderate income, defined operationally as households earning
 up to 50% , 80% , 120%, and more than 120% of the San Bernardino
 County median income, respectively. The allocations are further adjusted
 to avoid an over-concentration of lower income households in any one
 jurisdiction. The fair share allocation must also consider the existing
 “deficit” of housing resulting from lower income households that pay
 more than 30% of their incomes for housing costs. As discussed earlier,
 this is the threshold used by HUD to determine housing affordability.
 The 2014-2021 Regional Housing Needs Assessment for the City of
 Adelanto is 2,841 housing units, including 663 units for very low-income
 households, 459 units for low-income households, 513 units for moderate-
 income households, and 1,236 units for above moderate-income
 households.
 Adelanto adopted an updated element for the 2008-2014 planning period,
 and has a remaining 3,663 low and very low income opportunity sites to
 address from the previous housing element cycle, with this Housing
 Element. That is, the remaining deficit in housing units from the 2008-
 2014 RHNA is being accommodated concurrently with this Housing
 Element. The remaining RHNA allocation for Adelanto for the 2008-2014
 planning period was 3,663 units including 2,166 for very low, 1,497 for
 low. (Table 39). Adelanto’s last adopted Housing Element addressed
 housing conditions between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2008.
                                Table 39

 PROGRESS TOWARDS THE RHNA
 The RHNA allocation process establishes January 1, 2014 as the baseline
 for growth projections for the Housing Element planning period of 2014-
 2021, jurisdictions may count toward the RHNA any new units built or
 approved since January 1, 2014.
                  Page 72

                            City of Adelanto Housing Element
During the previous Housing Element cycle there was adequate
construction of Moderate and Above Moderate housing; therefore, there
is no remaining Moderate and Above Moderate housing units to
accommodate for in that planning period. Since there is a remaining 3,663
Low and Very Low income units to provide for in the last planning
period and 1,092 Low and Very Low income units to provide for in this
planning period, all units are accommodated concurrent with the
adoption of this Housing Element. Additionally, all Moderate and Above
Moderate income units can be accommodated in our existing Single-
Family Residential (R1) zone as identified in figure 6. 450 acres of land
have been identified which could accommodate a total of 1,800 units at
four units per acre. Figure 14 shows a map of the identified sites and
Table       48       list     the      properties       and       acreage.
CALCULATING AFFORDABILITY LEVELS
Based on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), homes sold in Adelanto July
2013 had a median sales price of $128,000, a decrease of 55 percent since
January of 2008. Housing prices declined even further in 2009. Merrill
Lynch forecasted a 10 percent drop in 2009, which was followed by
additional depreciation in 2010. The maximum affordable price of a
home for an average family household in the City of Adelanto within the
low income and very low income category is $180,525 and $101,270,
respectively. Based on MLS home sales July 2013, 75 of the 172 homes
sold (44%) are within the affordable range for very low income families,
and almost all homes sold (98%) within that time period are within the
affordable range for low-income families. Consequently, all the identified
homes approved or constructed since 2013 are, based on sales price,
affordable to moderate-income households and will continue to be for
years to come based on historic and current sales data.
Based on this data, RHNA credits have been calculated assuming that,
with the continued housing market downturn, the median home sales
price will be affordable to most homebuyers. As these units are currently
not deed or covenant restricted the units can be credited toward the
City’s moderate and above-moderate income RHNA allocation only.
These can be easily accommodated in our current R1 zoning district
shown in Figure 14 (Opportunity Site 9).
REMAINING RHNA
A majority of the housing units constructed and approved in the City of
Adelanto between January 2008 and the present are considered affordable
to low income households at market rate; however these properties do
not currently have covenants restricting long-term affordability.
Although current housing prices are very low and many homes have
                                           Page 73

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 been sold at levels affordable to even very-low income households, the
 City has credited all residential units approved and constructed between
 January 1, 2008 and the present toward their moderate and above-
 moderate income RHNA allocation. Including the credits, as shown in
 Table 40, the City is more than capable of meeting its moderate and
 above-moderate RHNA allocation, but has a remaining RHNA of 3,663
 very low- and low-income-housing units (see Table 40). The remaining
 very low- and low-income RHNA is anticipated to be accommodated
 through rezoning as discussed in the following section.

 AVAILABILITY OF SITES FOR HOUSING
 IDENTIFYING ADEQUATE SITES
 State law requires that a community provide an adequate number of sites
 to allow for and facilitate production of the City’s regional share of
 housing.      To determine whether the City has sufficient land to
 accommodate its share of regional housing needs for all income groups,
 the City must identify “adequate sites.” Under State law (California
 Government Code Section 65583.c.1), adequate sites are those with
 appropriate zoning and development standards, with services and
 facilities, needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a variety
 of housing for all income levels. According to State Law, land considered
 suitable for residential development includes:
     Vacant residentially zoned sites
     Vacant non-residentially zoned sites that allow residential uses
       (such as mixed-use)
     Underutilized residentially zoned sites that are capable of being
       developed at a higher density or with greater intensity
                   Page 74

                              City of Adelanto Housing Element
     Non-residential zoned sites that can be redeveloped for, and/or
      rezoned for, residential use (via program actions)
An important component of the Adelanto Housing Element is the
identification of remaining sites and future housing development
opportunities in the 2014-2021 planning period. Since Adelanto has a
sufficient amount of undeveloped land, all of the housing opportunity
sites identified in the Sites Inventory section are on vacant residentially or
non-residentially zoned land.
After analyzing the vacant land available in the City, Adelanto has
determined that in order to accommodate their remaining RHNA
allocation they have created a, new, high density zone and propose a
new Mixed Use zone. Both zones are outlined in the Housing Plan and
will allow for a density of 30 dwelling units per acre. In addition, to
creating the new zone, the City has identified eight sites that have been
rezoned to accommodate the City’s remaining allocation of 3,663 for the
2008-2014 planning period and new allocation of 1,092 very low and low-
income units for the 2014-2021 planning period. These sites are described
in detail in the following pages and will accommodate a total of 4,818
units which is greater than the 1,092 units needed for the current
planning period.
In identifying areas available to accommodate their remaining units, the
City wants to ensure that multifamily units are not concentrated in any
one area of the City. Consequently, the sites selected are scattered
throughout the jurisdiction near existing residential uses, along major
existing or future arterial roadways, or near services/employment centers
appropriate to support new development. Figure 5, Housing Opportunity
Sites, is a citywide map illustrating the location of the nine proposed high
density residential and low density residential sites selected to
accommodate the City’s remaining very low, low, moderate and above
moderate income RHNA allocation.
REALISTIC CAPACITY
To accommodate the City’s remaining RHNA nine sites have been
selected as opportunity sites with potential for the development of
affordable housing. Seven of the nine sites have been rezoned as High
Density Residential, which allows for a minimum density of 30 dwelling
units per acre. The proposed Mixed Use zone is not used in this Element
cycle as the City is in the process of preparing a new Sustainability Plan
that identifies Mixed Use zones near the Town Center and Entertainment
Center. All but one of the eight sites identified in the 2008-2014 Housing
Element cycle are now rezoned to High Density Residential, (R3-30) as
                                              Page 75

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 identified in the following maps. Site one, eight and a part of site four
 have been rezoned to R3-30 concurrent with this Element. Portions of
 sites five and six and all of sites two and three have been previously
 rezoned in the past 18 months. Site seven is not part of this Housing
 Element Cycle but has been identified for future rezoning. Site nine is
 already zoned R1 and will accommodate 1,800 moderate and above
 moderate income RHNA requirements for the new planning period. The
 following map is used to identify sites. It shows High Density, Low
 Density and Mixed Use zones. All rezoning for this cycle is being done as
 stated above. There is no Mixed Use rezoning proposed with this
 Housing Element Cycle.
 All of the Moderate Income (513) and Above Moderate Income (1,236)
 units required of the 2014-2021 Housing Element can be accommodated
 on existing R1 Zoned land as demonstrated in Figure 14 and Table 48.
 The City has identified 450 acres of land that can accommodate 1,800
 Moderate and Above Moderate Income units. This existing R1 zone has
 adequate access to and from the site via Cactus Road to HWY 395 which
 connects to the rest of the City’s services. Water and Sewer are nearby as
 they are provided to developed residential development in the area.
 All opportunity sites identified in the following pages are located outside
 of any potential flood or earthquake fault zones.

SITE 1 – EL MIRAGE HIGH DENSITY
Site 1 is located in the northern half of the City to the west and adjacent to Interstate-395. The
site is split by El Mirage Road and includes 5 vacant, square and rectangular, parcels totaling
59.9 acres. The site is bordered on the north by Avalon Avenue, on the east by Larkspur Road
with no formal existing southern or western boundaries. Currently, 4 of the 5 parcels are
designated General Commercial while the southern half of the larger rectangular south of El
Mirage Road is zoned Medium Density Residential (8 du/ac).
Following a zone change, all five parcels have been rezoned to High Density allowing for 30
dwelling units per acre. Site 1 could potentially yield 1,797 new units. While Site 1, and much
of the surrounding area, is currently vacant, this site is an appropriate area to rezone, as the
adjacent parcels are zoned Medium Density Residential and General Commercial. Currently,
there are a number of entitled residential and commercial projects to the south of the site that
will extend services, jobs, and infrastructure within close proximity of the site.
Through their planning efforts, Adelanto has identified El Mirage as a key east-west corridor in
the City and plans to develop higher intensity uses that are compatible with and would provide
needed jobs and services to lower income households. The City envisions that commercial uses
will be developed along Highway-395 and along El Mirage and finally into high and medium
density residential uses in the outlying areas. The development of higher density housing and
commercial businesses in this area would help to establish a balanced mix of uses in the area.
Infrastructure for the site would be provided as El Mirage Road is improved.
To encourage the development of affordable units, the City will offer a density bonus incentive,
development concessions, site improvement assistance, fast track processing, and RDA and/or
HOME funding when available. Funding opportunities and development incentive
opportunities will be prioritized for projects that include units for extremely low- and very-low
income households.

SITE 2 – AUBURN AVENUE HIGH DENSITY
Site 2 is located near the center of the City, approximately one mile west of HWY-395. The site
includes 5 vacant, square parcels totaling 20.24 acres. The site is bordered on the north by
Auburn Avenue, on the south by Vintage Road, on the west by Rhode Island Street with no
formal eastern boundary. Currently, all 5 parcels are zoned Medium Density Residential.
Following a zone change, all five parcels have been rezoned to High Density Residential
allowing 30 dwelling units per acre. If developed to its full potential and the maximum
allowable density, Site 2 could accommodate up to 607 new affordable units. While Site 2, and
much of the surrounding area, is currently vacant, this site is an appropriate area to rezone, as
the adjacent parcels are zoned for Medium Density Residential.
Located just south of the El Mirage corridor, there are a number of entitled residential and
commercial projects adjacent to and surrounding Site 2. A majority of the entitled projects are
located to the west of the site and will extend services, jobs, and infrastructure within close
proximity of the site. There are plans for residential development which has been approved to
the east. The City envisions that this site will further be supported by commercial and mixed
use development along HWY-395 and El Mirage with direct access to jobs and services. The
development of higher density housing and commercial businesses in this area would also help
transition the historic downtown into areas with higher intensity development. Infrastructure
for the site would be provided on a project by project basis; however the entitlement of
surrounding properties is likely to make it less costly for infrastructure to be developed.
To encourage the development of affordable units, the City will offer a density bonus incentive,
development concessions, site improvement assistance, fast track processing, and RDA and/or
HOME funding when available. Funding opportunities and development incentive
opportunities will be prioritized for projects that include units for extremely low- and very-low
income households.

SITE 3 – VINTAGE ROAD RESIDENTIAL
Located just south and east of Site 2, Site 3 is also located in the center of the City, roughly half a
mile west of HWY-395. The site includes 4 vacant, rectangular parcels of varying sizes that total
19.9 acres. Site 3 is bordered on the north by Vintage Road, on the south by Chamberlaine Way,
on the west by Verbena Road and on the east by Hermosa Road. Currently, the entire site is
zoned Medium Density Residential.
Following a zone change, all of Site 3 has been rezoned to High Density Residential allowing for
30 dwelling units per acre. If developed to its full potential and the maximum allowable
density, Site 3 could accommodate up to 598 new affordable units. While Site 3, and much of
the surrounding area, is currently vacant, this site is an appropriate area to rezone, as the
adjacent parcels are zoned for a mix of Single Family Residential and Medium Density
Residential.
Similar to Site 2, Site 3 has easy access to HWY-395, El Mirage Road and the historic downtown.
While a significant number of residential projects have been entitled to the west of the site, a
new commercial project has also been entitled on the property to the south. The City envisions
that residents living on this site will access jobs and services via HWY-395 and El Mirage Road.
The development of higher density housing and commercial businesses in this area would also
help transition the historic downtown into areas with higher intensity development.
Infrastructure for the site would be provided on a project by project basis; however
development on adjacent and surrounding properties is likely to make it less costly for
infrastructure to be developed.
To encourage the development of affordable units, the City will offer a density bonus incentive,
development concessions, site improvement assistance, fast track processing, and RDA and/or

                        SITE 4 – CHAMBERLAINE WAY HIGH DENSITY
Located in the center of the City, Site 4 is situated roughly a quarter of a mile west of HWY-395.
The site includes a total of 37.3 acres of land, and 17 parcels of varying sizes allowing for a
variety of development scenarios and increasing the likelihood that a cohesive development
will occur. Site 4 is bordered on the north by Chamberlaine Way, on the south by Lee Avenue,
with no formal boundaries to the east or west. Currently, the entire site is zoned Medium
Density Residential.
The total acreage of the site is approximately 37.3 acres with at least 22.3 acres of vacant,
undeveloped land and 15 acres of underutilized land. The actual amount of vacant land is,
however, much greater than 22.3 acres as many of the underutilized parcels included in this site
contain older single family ranch-style homes on a small portion of the parcel surrounded by
significant areas of open, undeveloped land. According to assessor’s parcel data these homes
were constructed in the 1950’s and from recent aerials and a recent visual survey, are in need of
rehabilitation.
All of the parcels identified as part of Site 4 are currently zoned Medium Density Residential,
which allows up to 8 dwelling units per acre. The eastern half of the site, including 7 parcels
totaling 22.05 acres has been rezoned to High Density Residential. If developed to its full
potential and the maximum allowable density, this residential zoned portion of Site 4 could
accommodate up to 662 new affordable units. Site 4 is an appropriate location for a number of
new housing units as the site is located near existing residential development and has easy
access to HWY-395, El Mirage and the historic downtown. While much of the surrounding area
is currently vacant, this site is also an appropriate area to rezone, as the adjacent parcels are
zoned for Medium Density Residential. A significant number of residential projects have been
entitled to the west of the site. The development of higher density housing and commercial
businesses in this area would also help transition the historic downtown into areas with higher
intensity development. Infrastructure is more readily available in the area surrounding Site 4 as
there are a number of single family developments in existence. It is likely that infrastructure
upgrades may be necessary to support a higher density project; however available capacity
would be evaluated as projects are proposed.
To encourage the development of affordable units, the City will offer a density bonus incentive,
development concessions, site improvement assistance, fast track processing, and RDA and/or
HOME funding when available. Funding opportunities and development incentive
opportunities will be prioritized for projects that include units for extremely low- and very-low
income households.

SITE 5 – LUPIN ROAD HIGH DENSITY
Site 5 is located in the southern half of the City, adjacent to HWY-395. The site includes 1
vacant, rectangular parcel that is approximately 17.4 acres in size. Site 5 is bordered on the
south by Lupin Road, on the west by Pearmain Street, on the east by HWY-395 with no formal
boundary to the north. Currently the entire site is zoned General Commercial.
Following a zone change, half of Site 5 (9.0 acres) has been rezoned to High Density allowing for
30 dwelling units per acre. The High Density portion of Site 5 (9.0 acres) could potentially yield
270 new units and has been rezoned concurrently with the adoption of the 2008-2014 Housing
Element. There are a number of entitled commercial projects along HWY-395 as well as a
number of existing residential neighborhoods to the west.
This site is an appropriate area to rezone, as the adjacent parcels are zoned for General
Commercial and there is a significant amount of existing residential development in the area.
Currently, there are also a number of entitled residential and commercial projects to the south
that will also extend services, jobs, and infrastructure within close proximity of the site. The
City envisions that commercial uses will be developed along the HWY-395 transitioning to high
density residential and finally into high and medium density residential uses in the outlying
areas. The development of higher density housing and commercial businesses in this area
would help to establish a balanced mix of uses in the area. It is likely that infrastructure
upgrades may be necessary to support a higher density project; however available capacity
would be evaluated as projects are proposed.
To encourage the development of affordable units, the City will offer a density bonus incentive,

SITE 6 – VILLA STREET HIGH DENSITY
Site 6 is located in the southern half of the City, adjacent to HWY-395. The site includes 6
vacant, rectangular parcels that total approximately 29.1 acres. Site 6 is bordered on the north
by Villa Street, on the west by Pearmain Street, on the east by HWY-395 with no formal
boundary to the north. Currently the entire site is zoned General Commercial.
Following a zone change, Site 6 has been rezoned to High Density allowing for a minimum 30
dwelling units per acre. The High Density portion of the site (9.4 acres) could potentially yield
283 new units, and was rezoned with the adoption of the previous Housing Element. In
rezoning the area from commercial to High Density the City wants to encourage the
development of higher intensity uses along the highway. It is likely that commercial uses
adjacent to the site would be developed fronting the highway with higher density residential
transitioning into existing single family homes to the west of the site. There are a number of
entitled commercial projects along HWY-395 as well as a number of existing residential
neighborhoods to the west.
Similar to Site 5, this site is an appropriate area to rezone, as the adjacent parcels are zoned for
General Commercial and there is a significant amount of existing residential development in the
area. Currently, there are also a number of entitled residential and commercial projects to the
south that will also extend services, jobs, and infrastructure within close proximity of the site.
The development of higher density housing and commercial businesses in this area would help
to establish a balanced mix of uses in the area. It is likely that infrastructure upgrades may be
necessary to support a higher density project; however available capacity would be evaluated as
projects are proposed.
To encourage the development of affordable units, the City will offer a density bonus incentive,
development concessions, site improvement assistance, fast track processing, and RDA and/or
HOME funding when available. Funding opportunities and development incentive
opportunities will be prioritized for projects that include units for extremely low- and very-low
income households.

SITE 7 – PEARMAIN & BEGONIA MIXED USE
Site 7 is located in the southern corner of the City, at the intersection of HWY-395 and Palmdale
Road (State Highway 18). The site includes 2 vacant, parcels totaling 22.0 acres. Site 7 is
bordered on the south by Palmdale Road, on the west by Pearmain Street, on the east by HWY-
395 and would be located south of Begonia Road if it extended through to HWY-395. Currently
the entire site is zoned General Commercial.
Site 7 is not part of this Housing Element but is discussed as it was part of the 2008-2014
Housing Element. Following a zone change, Site 7, which is 22 acres, will be rezoned to Mixed
Use Residential allowing for 30 dwelling units per acre. Given that for mixed use sites, 50% of
the developable area can be counted toward the RHNA, this site could potentially yield 330
new units. In rezoning the area from commercial to mixed use the City wants to encourage the
development of higher intensity uses at a crucial intersection serving as a major gateway into
the City. There is an existing commercial retail center including a grocery store and other retail
and commercial uses currently operating on the area adjacent to the site. The addition of new
commercial uses and higher density residential development would be compatible with the
existing surrounding development. There are also a number of entitled commercial projects
along HWY-395 and Palmdale Road, in addition to existing and proposed residential
development to the north.
This site is an appropriate area to rezone, as the adjacent parcels are zoned for General
Commercial and there is a significant amount of existing residential development in the area.
The entitled residential and commercial projects in the surrounding area will extend services,
jobs, and infrastructure within close proximity of the site. The development of higher density
housing and commercial businesses in this area would help to establish a balanced mix of uses
in the area and provide residents with new housing options in the southern portion of the City.
It is likely that infrastructure upgrades may be necessary to support a higher density project;
however available capacity would be evaluated as projects are proposed.
To encourage the development of affordable units, the City will offer a density bonus incentive,
development concessions, site improvement assistance, fast track processing, and RDA and/or
HOME funding when available. Funding opportunities and development incentive
opportunities will be prioritized for projects that include units for extremely low- and very-low
income households.

SITE 8 – PALMDALE ROAD HIGH DENSITY
Site 8 is located along the southern boundary of the City, along Palmdale Road (State Highway
18). The site includes 2 vacant, parcels totaling 20.07 acres. Site 8 is loosely bordered by Begonia
Road on the north, Palmdale Road on the south, with no formal boundary to the east or west.
Generally, the site is situated east of Bellflower Street and west of Jonathon Street. Currently the
parcel on the west is zoned General Commercial while the parcel on the east is zoned both
General Commercial and Single Family Residential.
Following a zone change, Site 8 has been rezoned to High Density allowing for 30 dwelling
units per acre. Given that for high density use sites, 100% of the developable area can be
counted toward the RHNA, this site could potentially yield 602 new units. There are a number
of entitled commercial projects along Palmdale Road as well as a number of existing residential
neighborhoods to the north. In rezoning the area from commercial to high density the City
wants to encourage higher intensity development to complement the proposed and existing
commercial development in the area.
This site is an appropriate area to rezone, as the adjacent parcels are zoned for or are developed
with a mix of residential and commercial uses. Currently, there are entitled commercial projects
adjacent to the western edge of the site that will provide services, jobs, and infrastructure to
support future development on the site. The City envisions that commercial uses will be
developed along the Palmdale Road transitioning to high density residential and finally into
high and medium density residential uses in the outlying areas. The development of higher
density housing and commercial businesses in this area would help to establish a balanced mix
of uses in the area. It is likely that infrastructure upgrades may be necessary to support a higher
density project; however available capacity would be evaluated as projects are proposed.
To encourage the development of affordable units, the City will offer a density bonus incentive,
development concessions, site improvement assistance, fast track processing, and RDA and/or
HOME funding when available. Funding opportunities and development incentive
opportunities will be prioritized for projects that include units for extremely low- and very-low
income households.

SITE 9 – CACTUS STREET SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL
Site 9 is located in the middle of the City, adjacent to Cactus Street. The site includes 81 vacant,
rectangular parcels that total approximately 450.24 acres. Site 9 is bordered on the north by
Holly Road, on the west by Raccoon Avenue, on the south by Cactus Road with no formal
boundary to the east. Currently the entire site is zoned Single-Family Residential (R1).
Site 9, is zoned R1 allowing for a maximum of 4 dwelling units per acre. The site (450.24 acres)
could potentially yield 1,800 new moderate and above moderate income units. The site is
located adjacent to Cactus Road and is near HWY 395 to the east. It is likely that commercial
uses would be developed fronting the highway with higher density residential transitioning
into single family homes at this site. There are a number of entitled commercial projects along
HWY-395 as well as a number of existing residential neighborhoods in the area.
Site nine has great potential to accommodate moderate and above moderate income RHNA
allocations as it is already zoned for low density residential allowing for four units per acre with
a minimum lot size of 7,200 square feet. There is adequate circulation provided by an east west
corridor, Cactus Road that connects with HWY 395 to the east and a north south corridor
provided by Bellflower Street that connects with HWY 18 to the south.

 SUMMARY OF AVAILABLE SITES
 As outlined in the previous section, the City had a total combined RHNA
 allocation of 3,663 low and very low income units remaining for the 2008-
 2014 planning period. The City has a remaining RHNA need from the
 previous planning period of 2,166 very low income units and 1,497 low
 income units, totaling 3,663 units. The remaining 3,663 very low- and
 low-income units are accommodated as shown in the sites inventory by
 rezoning sites to allow for higher density projects to be developed. Table
 49 provides detailed site information showing how the housing
 opportunity sites can accommodate the City’s remaining RHNA
 allocation.
 For the new planning period, 2014-2021 the 633 very low and 459 low
 income units are also accommodated by the rezoned sites that allow for
 higher density projects to be developed. Table 49 provides detailed site
 information showing how the housing opportunity sites can
 accommodate          the    City’s     current      RHNA        allocation.

In accordance with Program 20 of the Housing Plan sites 1, 8 and parts of
site 4 identified in the inventory have been rezoned from their existing
zoning to High Density Residential zones, which allow for densities of 30
dwelling units per acre. Following the implementation of Program 20 and
including the sites previously rezoned, approximately 4,819 lower income
units can be accommodated. Table 49 shows by site the City’s efforts to
accommodate their total RHNA allocation for the 2008-2013 and 2014-
2021 planning periods for very low, low, moderate and above moderate
income units, including the acreage and realistic unit capacity for each
site. Based on Table 50, shown below, the City is more than able to
accommodate their remaining RHNA as Program 20 of the Housing Plan
is implemented and seven of the eight sites identified above are rezoned
to their proposed density.

 *Moderate and above moderate housing units are accommodated in current R1 zoned land
 The City anticipates that with higher density zones, the development of
 affordable housing may be more easily facilitated. Allowing for a variety
 of developments in various areas of the City at different densities is
 crucial to ensuring that affordable units are not concentrated in one
 specific area. It is also necessary to ensure that units of varying sizes,
 product types and styles can be developed. Based on the City’s past
 housing development, the current economic climate that has allowed
 even very low and low income households to purchase single family
 units and the housing opportunity sites identified in this section, the City
 can more than accommodate the production of affordable housing to
 meet their combined RHNA allocation.
 OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
 Conventional building construction, use and demolition along with the
 manufacturing of building materials have multiple impacts on our
 environment. In the United States, the building industry accounts for:
         65 % of electricity consumption
         30 % of greenhouse gas emissions
         30 % of raw materials use
         30 % of landfill waste
         12 % of potable water consumption
 Interest in addressing these impacts at all levels of government has been
 growing. In 2004, the State of California adopted legislation requiring
 LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification for
 new and renovated public buildings. Some local jurisdictions have not
 only adopted similar standards for their public buildings, but have also
                       Page 98

                            City of Adelanto Housing Element
recently required LEED certification for larger commercial and residential
developments.
LEED certification building standards are one piece of a coordinated
green building program. Why would a city adopt a green building
program? Most local building standards already consider energy and
storm water issues. In addition, many jurisdictions have programs related
to energy, recycling, water conservation, storm water management, land
use, and public health. However, these programs are often overlapping
and uncoordinated. One of the primary goals behind establishing a green
building program is to create a holistic, integrated design approach to
green building.
A green building program considers a broad range of issues including
community and site design, energy efficiency, water conservation,
resource-efficient material selection, indoor environmental quality,
construction management, and building maintenance. The end result will
be buildings that minimize the use of resources, are healthier for people,
and reduce harm to the environment.
Bothe the public and private sectors currently offer grants, refunds, and
other funding for green building. In addition, developments built to
green standards assist both the owners and tenants with energy and
maintenance costs over time.
Other efforts by cities related to energy conservation include: providing
information regarding energy efficient techniques for rehabilitation;
referrals for residents and businesses to energy conservation programs;
and local incentives for building green.
The following presents a variety of ways in which Adelanto can promote
energy conservation:
       Advertise utility rebate programs and energy audits available
        through Edison and Southern California Gas, particularly
        connected to housing rehabilitation programs. Lower-income
        households are also eligible for State Sponsored energy and
        weatherization programs.
       Develop green (energy-efficient and environmentally-sensitive0
        building standards for public buildings.
       Provide incentives, such as expedited plan checks, for private
        developments that are building green.
       Support the elimination of contamination in older buildings (lead-
        based paint, asbestos, etc.) during rehabilitation and code
        inspections.
                                            Page 99

City of Adelanto Housing Element
       Allow higher densities and mixed use development within
        walking distance of commercial, thereby reducing vehicular trips
        and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
       Promote funding opportunities for private green buildings,
        including available rebates.
       Encourage alternative energy solutions for residential
        development.
       Promote financial resources available through the California
        Energy Commission for use of solar panels.
       Provide resource materials and training opportunities regarding
        green building and energy conservation.
       Apply green building criteria t rehabilitation of single and multi-
        family buildings.
 Southern California Edison (SCE) offers a variety of energy conservation
 services under Customer Assistance Programs (CAP). These services are
 designed to help low-income households, senior citizens, permanently
 disabled, and non-English speaking customers control their energy use.
 All CAP participants must meet the federally-established income
 guidelines. Most services are available free of charge.
 The Southern California Gas Company offers an energy conservation
 service known as the Community Involvement Program (CIP). This
 service provides weatherization for the homes or apartment of low-
 income families, provided they meet the federally-established income
 guidelines. These services are provided to the low-income families free of
 charge while later being reimbursed by the Gas Company.

HOUSING SITE CONSTRAINTS
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Locations identified in the Sites Inventory were compared with all
hazards maps included in the City’s Safety Element; none were found to
be within areas that have development restrictions due to risk of damage
from disasters (such as floods, wildfires, or seismic events). The sites
inventoried have a land use designation which was determined based on
surrounding land uses and has already examined potential
environmental constraints. Aside from the constraints mentioned above,
there are few if any additional constraints that would impede the
development of new housing units in the future on the identified sites.
INFRASTRUCTURE
The City’s five year Capital Improvement Plan has identified
expenditures of City funds used for public improvement projects,
including infrastructure. The City understands that improvements can be
achieved with a comprehensive approach that includes reviewing
infrastructure plans for each application for discretionary approval of
General Plan amendments, tentative parcel or tentative tract maps, or
development proposals that includes extension of an existing street or
construction of a new street. The City requires that project applications
for new development be reviewed for adequate infrastructure.
Applications are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure there is the
capacity to service new developments. Infrastructure requirements and
costs are also discussed in the Non-Governmental Constraints Section of
the Housing Element.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOURCES
ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
Primary responsibility for the implementation of the City’s housing
programs and activities lies with the City Manager, the Planning
Department, and the Building and Safety Department.

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 CITY OF ADELANTO PLANNING DEPARTMENT
 The primary responsibilities of the Planning Division include the overall
 implementation of the City’s General Plan goals and policies through the
 application of the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances and adoption of
 specific plans. In addition, the Planning Division is responsible for the
 long-range planning and physical development of the City. The
 department ensures the City’s viability through enforcement of land use,
 construction, health, safety, and environmental regulations.
 CITY OF ADELANTO REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
 As previously discussed, the City of Adelanto had limited
 Redevelopment Agency set aside funds available during the 2008-2014
 planning period. In 1993, Adelanto sold $46.8 million of tax allocation
 bonds secured by tax increment revenue projected to have a six percent
 increase for the first four years; however, the bonds valuation decreased
 14.6 percent the next fiscal year, and in following years, the valuation
 never met its projections. The Redevelopment Agency has continued to
 borrow sufficient funds annually to make up the difference between net
 tax increment revenues and its semi-annual debt service payment
 obligations. As a result, the Agency is severely restricted in its ability to
 provide programs (Adelanto RDA 2009-2014 Implementation Plan).
 In 2002, the City merged the existing two redevelopment project areas
 and adopted a new redevelopment area known as Project No. 3. While
 the merged areas are still obligated to service the City’s outstanding debt
 and are not able to contribute to the housing set-aside fund, the new
 Project Area No. 3 is able to both service the debt and contribute to the
 set-aside fund. This new area is the sole source of revenue contributing to
 the City’s housing set-aside fund, but provides the City with a limited
 amount of money for the development of affordable housing.
 As required by State law, twenty percent of Agency tax increment funds
 are set-aside for affordable housing activities within the Redevelopment
 Area. The City has project the set-aside fund accruals for each fiscal year
 through 2014 to include:
 o   Fiscal Year 2009/2010: $119,446
 o   Fiscal Year 2010/2011: $88,485
 o   Fiscal Year 2011/2012: $88,485
 o   Fiscal Year 2012/2013: $91,725
 o   Fiscal Year 2013/2014: $95,030
                  Page 102

                            City of Adelanto Housing Element
By the end of the planning period, the redevelopment housing set-aside
fund is estimated to total approximately $483,171. As limited funding is
available in the housing set-aside fund for this RHNA cycle, the Housing
Plan focuses primarily on education and awareness of other funding
opportunities available to homeowners from other sources. Funding
efforts required for most programs are minimal (i.e. providing
information about services and programs on the City’s website) in order
to preserve funding for programs that can assist in the development of
actual affordable housing units. When funds are available the City will
utilize this money to provide fee waivers, on/off-site improvements, fast
track processing, and other incentives to affordable housing developers
as projects are presented. As mentioned in the Housing Plan and Housing
Resources section funding opportunities will be prioritized for extremely
low and low income unit development.
Since the Governor has discontinued all Redevelopment Agencies and
funding, RDA funds are no longer available.
IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS
A variety of federal, State and local programs are available for housing
activities. These programs are also available to other jurisdictions for
potential acquisition, subsidy, or replacement of units at-risk. Table 52
summarizes financial resources available to the City and private and non-
profit parties to preserve/create housing.

                      5. Evaluation of 2008-2013 Housing Element
                      State law (California Government Code Section 65588[a]) requires
                      jurisdictions to review their housing elements to evaluate:
                            The appropriateness of housing goals, objectives, and policies in
                              contributing to the attainment of the state housing goal;
                            The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the
                              community’s housing goals and objectives; and
                            The progress in implementation of the housing element.
                      The evaluation helps a jurisdiction identify the extent to which adopted
                      programs have been successful in achieving stated objectives and
                      addressing local needs, and how such programs continue to be relevant
                      in addressing current and future housing needs. The evaluation provides
                      the basis for recommended modifications to policies and programs in the
                      updated element, and provides meaningful guidance for establishing
                      new objectives.
                      This section summarizes Adelanto’s accomplishments toward
                      implementing the Housing Element adopted in 2012 that covers the
                      planning period of 2008-2013. Table 52 summarizes the quantified
                      objectives contained in the City’s 2008-2014 Housing Element, and
                      evaluates the progress toward fulfilling these objectives. A program-by-
                      program review is presented in Table 53.

6. HOUSING PLAN
The Housing Plan sets forth the City’s overall housing goals in the form of Goals,
Policies, and Programs.
While most General Plan element programs are located in Appendix A, programs for the
Housing Element are contained within the Element. This format will facilitate the
periodic update (every eight years) of the Housing Element, as required by State Law.
This Plan identifies goals, policies, and programs that guide housing policy for the City
for 2014-2021. The goals, policies, and programs are consistent with the direction of the
other General Plan elements, specifically the Land Use Element.
ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES – BACKGROUND TO
AVAILABLE HOUSING FUNDS
               As previously discussed, the City of Adelanto does not have any
               Redevelopment Agency Set Aside Funds due to previous debt and
               obligations with the County of San Bernardino. In 1993, Adelanto sold
               $46.8 million of tax allocation bonds secured by tax increment revenue
               projected to have a six percent increase for the first four years; however,
               the bonds valuation decreased 14.6 percent the next fiscal year, and in
               following years, the valuation never met its projections.              The
               Redevelopment Agency has continued to borrow sufficient funds
               annually to make up the difference between net tax increment revenues
               and its semi-annual debt service payment obligations. As a result, the
               Agency is severely restricted in its ability to provide programs.
                                                                  Page 112

                           City of Adelanto Housing Element
Housing Goals
Adelanto’s housing goals, policies, and programs address the following
five major areas:
H.1. Conserve, preserve, and improve the condition of the existing
affordable housing stock.
H.2.   Assist in the development of affordable housing.
H.3. Address and where appropriate, and legally possible, remove
governmental constraints to housing development.
H.4.   Promote equal housing opportunity
H.5. Provide adequate sites to achieve housing variety and meet the
2008-2013 and 2014-2021 RHNA.
These goals are required by and delineated in State Law (California Code
Section 65583 [c][1]).

 GOAL H.1: PRESERVE AND IMPROVE THE
 HOUSING STOCK
 Maintaining and improving the quality of the existing housing and
 residential neighborhoods in Adelanto is a high priority. Continued
 maintenance of the existing housing stock ensures high-quality
 neighborhoods. Housing activities that help achieve these goals include
 rehabilitation of single- and multi-family housing units and preservation
 of assisted housing units.
                           Encourage the maintenance and enhancement of

 Program 1: Neighborhood Rehabilitation Program
 The Neighborhood Rehabilitation Program is focused on rehabilitating
 rental and ownership housing units within the City of Adelanto. The
 program will be facilitated by the City, with support from local
 community groups. The program will target units in need of minor
 rehabilitation, painting, and other exterior improvements primarily in the
 northern portion of the City (north of Air Expressway) as this area
 consists of older homes in need of regabilitation. As the population of the
 City grows, the CDBG entitlement through the County of San Bernardino
 will also grow and these allocated funds will be used to supplement and
 support the program. Senior citizen and handicapped households will be
 given high priority. The City will also investigate the possibility of
 purchasing distressed apartments and rehabilitating them for low- and
 very low-income households.
 Action:
     Encourage rehabilitation of 100 rental and owner occupied housing
       units within the City during the planning period through
       development of a public outreach program, which could consist of
                   Page 114

                            City of Adelanto Housing Element
      community workshops, volunteer workdays, and informational
      brochures.
Time Frame:                Program will be established within one year of
                           Housing Element adoption, administration of
                           the program will be ongoing, including the
                           cultivation of community volunteer contacts,
                           potential site identification, distribution of
                           informational brochures and posting on the city
                           website. Community workshops will be held
                           annually to determine which projects are to be
                           selected and completed within the year
                           depending upon available funding and
                           volunteer support.
Responsible Agency:        Planning Division
Funding Source:            County Funding through CDBG and HOME
Program 2: Home Weatherization Program
The City will review ordinances and recommend changes where
necessary to encourage energy efficient housing design and practices that
are consistent with state regulations. The City will periodically distribute
literature or post information on their website regarding energy
conservation and weatherization programs, and encourage homeowners
and landlords to apply for funding through these programs to upgrade
their properties.    When possible the City will encourage energy
conservation devices including, but not limited to lighting, water heater
treatments, and solar energy systems for all residential projects.
Currently there are two programs available for homeowners in Adelanto
including:
Action:
     County of San Bernardino – Low Income Energy Efficiency
      Weatherization Program
     Southern California Edison – CARE/FERA Rate Programs; Energy

 Program 3: Energy Efficient Design
 During the planning period the City will review ordinances and
 recommend changes where necessary to encourage energy efficient
 housing design and practices that are consistent with state regulations.
 The City will periodically distribute literature or post information on
 their website regarding energy conservation, including solar power,
 energy efficient insulation, building orientation, energy efficient
 appliances, and subsidies available from utility companies, and
 encourage homeowners and landlords to incorporate these features into
 construction and remodeling projects. When possible the City will
 encourage energy conservation devices including, but not limited to
 lighting, water heater treatments, and solar energy systems for all
 residential projects. The Planning and Housing divisions will encourage
 maximum utilization of Federal, State, and local government programs
 that assist homeowners in providing energy conservation measures.
 In addition the City of Adelanto is in the process of implementing the,
 “Adelanto North 2035 Sustainable Community Plan,” which is the result
 of the State of California Sustainable Communities Planning Grant and
 Incentives Program. The Adelanto North 2035 Sustainable Community
 Plan will propose a new paradigm for desert communities in San
 Bernardino County. This planning process creates a framework
 facilitating collaboration between public and private entities to promote
 sustainable development approaches, protect environmental resources,
 and forge a strong physical and economic connection between Southern
 California Logistic Airport (SCLA) jobs center and new mixed-use
 neighborhoods in North Adelanto. The Sustainable Community Plan will
 establish land use, transportation, infrastructure, economic development,
 and resource protection strategies that promote sustainable development
 approaches, particularly by reducing automobile usage and fuel
 consumption, and requiring cluster development approaches that protect
 and respect the sensitive desert environment. It is anticipated that the
 Sustainable Community Plan will be based on the concept of activity
                   Page 116

                             City of Adelanto Housing Element
centers surrounded by residential neighborhoods linked to the adjacent
jobs/business centers. Activity centers would create new dynamic focal
points and transit hubs. These would allow for community events to take
place, such as farmers’ markets, craft shows, and cultural performances.
In addition, “smart growth: and “healthy Community” concepts are
anticipated to be keystones in the Sustainable Community Plan.
Action:
    In conjunction with Program 16, Public Information, the City will
      provide workshops and/or other information on how to utilize
      programs to address energy conservation objectives.
    Revise the Zoning Code to create a new mixed use zone to develop
      jobs, services and housing within a walkable area within 18 months.
    Implement the North Adelanto 2035 Sustainable Community Plan.
Timeframe:              Workshops are held annually to provide
                        information on available programs to residents and
                        Developers on Energy Efficiency Design;
                        Informational brochures are also available in public
                        places and on the City website on energy
                        conservation      objectives    and      programs.
                        Additionally, the North Adelanto 2035 Sustainable
                        Community Plan will be implemented throughout
                        the coming year which will include revisions to the
                        Zoning Code and the creation of a new Mixed Use
                        zone.

Program 4: Energy Conservation
Title 24 of the California Administrative Code mandates uniform energy
conservation standards for new construction.            Minimum energy
conservation standards implemented through Title 24 may increase initial
construction costs throughout the State, but reduce operating expenses
and expenditure of natural resources over the long run and contribute to
the abatement of global warming. In addition to Title 24 the City of
Adelanto has instituted a number of water and energy saving measures.
In recent years Adelanto completed a Zoning Code update allowing
                                            Page 117

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 homeowners to more easily apply to implement solar panels in
 residential zones. The City also operates a “cash for grass” program
 where homeowners can sell their yards to be converted to California
 friendly fauna as well as a program offering water saving faucets and
 shower heads.
 In addition to City run programs, Southern California Edison offers a
 program available to income-qualified households. Under the Energy
 Management Assistance Program, Southern California Edison pays all the
 costs associated with purchasing and installing energy-efficient
 appliances and equipment. The City will continue to market the
 availability of this program to eligible customers.
 Action:
      Continue the Cash for Grass and water efficiency programs to
       provide services to at least 30 homes annually
      Educate homeowners on available energy management programs
       via flyers and City website.

 Program 5: Code Enforcement
 The City’s Code Enforcement program will encourage the identification
 of housing units in need of rehabilitation in the City. The objective of the
 City’s Code Enforcement Program is to bring substandard units into
 compliance with City Code. The City’s code enforcement officers work
 closely with the Planning Division, Redevelopment Agency, and public to
 identify units in need of housing assistance. This program usually
 involves absentee landowners who have neglected their properties.
 These efforts are intended to result in the improved maintenance of
 housing units throughout the City.
 Property owners are also informed of any rehabilitation loans or grants
 for which he/she may be eligible to assist in correcting the code violation.
 Action:
      Encourage rehabilitation of at least 10 rental and owner occupied
       housing units annually within the City by enforcing and informing
                   Page 118

                             City of Adelanto Housing Element

GOAL H.2: HOUSING TO MEET THE NEEDS
OF ALL INCOME LEVELS
Adelanto encourages the development of housing units affordable to all
segments of the population.
                          Explore approaches to residential development
 Policy H.2.1             that decrease the cost of housing and increase the
                          opportunity for affordable homeownership.
                          Encourage development of affordable rental
 Policy H.2.2             units for low-income and very low-income
                          households.
Program 6: Home Ownership
The Homeownership Program encourages renters to purchase affordable
housing scattered throughout the City. Given the low interest rates and
affordable housing prices available, the City will encourage renters to
purchase available homes located in the City. This program will target all
households with an emphasis on large family households and female-
headed households. As additional CDBG Funds become available
through the County, they may be used, to supplement this program.
Funding will be prioritized to assist extremely low- and very low-income
households. The City will also investigate the availability of Federal
HOME funds allocated by the County of San Bernardino.
Action:
    Continue to encourage renters to purchase affordable housing
      scattered throughout the City and set a goal of reducing the rental
      housing stock by 10 units annually.
    Investigate supplemental down payment assistance options

 Program 7: County Partnership Program
 As a means of further leveraging housing assistance, the City will
 cooperate with the County of San Bernardino Community Development
 and Housing Department to promote resident awareness and application
 for County run housing assistance programs. These programs include:
     Home Ownership Assistance Program (HAP)
     Community Development Block Grant Programs
            o  The Fair Housing Program
            o  The Single Family Home Improvement Loan Program
            o  The Senior Home Repair Program
     Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) Programs
     The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP)
 The County offers a variety of housing assistance programs that can
 supplement the City’s current housing programs. As the City has little
 control over how the County’s programs are administered, the City will
 be responsible for providing program information on the City’s website,
 and at City Hall.
 Action:
     Provide information and increase awareness of housing programs
      offered by the County on the City’s website and City Hall.
     Direct qualified residents, when applicable to the County’s
      programs for assistance.

Program 8: Density Bonus
State law requires cities to offer density bonuses to homebuilders and
developers as a means of encouraging the development of affordable
housing units for extremely low, very low, low, and moderate-income
households. Density bonuses and financial incentives or regulatory
concessions are granted when a developer proposes to construct
affordable housing.
Consistent with State law, developers in Adelanto can apply for a density
bonus of 20 to 35 percent, depending on the number, size and type of
affordable units provided. Concessions or exceptions to the City’s
development standards will also be offered as a means of further
facilitating the development of new housing units. The City will
encourage use of the density bonus provisions of State Law by providing
information on their website and at the public counter. In addition to the
density bonus incentive the City will offer development concessions, site
improvement assistance, RDA and/or HOME funding when available
and fast track processing to encourage the development of affordable
units. Funding opportunities and development incentive opportunities
will be prioritized for projects that include units for extremely low- and
very-low income households.
Action:
    Continue to encourage homebuilders and developers to use the
      density bonus provisions of State Law by providing advertising of
      the program at the public counter and on the City website. Set a goal
      of gaining 100 affordable units within the planning period

Program 9: Single Family Residential Development
The Single Family Residential Development Program is intended to
facilitate the development of fifty (50) new residential units in the City.
These units are anticipated to meet the City’s need for single-family
homes, manufactured housing, and mobile home units available to
residents to purchase for ownership. This program will focus on
facilitating public-private partnerships between housing developers and
                                            Page 121

 the City. The City will offer a density bonus incentive, development
 concessions, site improvement assistance, RDA and/or HOME funding
 when available and fast track processing to encourage the development
 of affordable units. Funding opportunities and development incentive
 opportunities will be prioritized for projects that include units for
 extremely low- and very-low income households. The City has
 determined that there is available vacant land and existing infrastructure
 capacity to meet this goal.
 Action:
     Continue to encourage developers to construct affordable housing
       by providing information about incentives and land availability on
       the City’s website and at the public counter.
 Time Frame:                Information will be added in public places
                            within a year of Housing Element adoption and
                            continually updated as necessary to encourage

 Program 10: Multi-Family Residential Development
 The Multi-Family Residential Development Program will provide ten (10)
 new multi-family units in the City. The City anticipates that two (2) units
 will be for low-income qualified residents and eight (8) units will be very
 low-income qualified residents. As land prices are currently inexpensive
 and development costs low in Adelanto, developers are able to build
 units affordable to low income and very low-income households that are
 considered to be “market-rate”.         To encourage new multi-family
 development the City will offer a density bonus incentive, development
 concessions, site improvement assistance, RDA and/or HOME funding
 when available and fast track processing to encourage the development
 of affordable units. Funding opportunities and development incentive
 opportunities will be prioritized for projects that include units for
 extremely low- and very-low income households. The City will
 encourage developers to build rental housing to meet the needs of this
 program.

Program 11: Section 8 Assistance
The Housing Choice Voucher Program helps extremely-low/very low-
income families, elderly, and the disabled afford safe, decent, and
sanitary housing in the private market. The program is funded by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Tenant
and property owners enter into a lease agreement, in which the tenant
pays no more than 40 percent of his or her adjusted income directly to the
property owner as rent. In a separate agreement, the San Bernardino
County Housing Authority pays the remaining portion of the contract
rent directly to the property owner. Participants are able to select any
housing that meets the requirements of the program, and is not limited to
units located in subsidized housing projects.
Action:
    Continually support the San Bernardino County Housing Authority
     efforts to maintain, and possibly increase, the current level of Section
     8 rental assistance to fund housing assistance for extremely low,
     very low-, and low-income households.
    Direct eligible households to the program through direct referrals
     and the City website.
    Provide information and referrals to landlords regarding
     participation in the Section 8 Rental Assistance Program.

 Goal H.3: Removal of Governmental
 Constraints
 Market and governmental factors pose constraints to the provision of
 adequate and affordable housing.                 These factors tend to
 disproportionately impact lower and moderate-income households due
 to their limited resources for absorbing the costs. The City is committed
 to removing governmental constraints that hinder the production of
 housing. In addition to the density bonuses and flexible development
 standards already in place, the City proposes revisions to the Zoning
 Ordinance to encourage housing opportunities for extremely low-income
 households and special needs persons.
                          Periodically review City regulations, ordinances,
                          permitting processes, and residential fees to
 Policy H.3.1
                          ensure that they do not constrain housing
                          development and are consistent with State law.
 Program 12: Residential Development Standards
 This program requires the City to annually review their development
 standards, development and permitting process and required on and off-
 site improvements and seek input from affordable housing developers to
 identify requirements that may constrain the development of affordable
 housing, market rate housing or housing for disabled residents. City
 Staff, when reviewing their standards, will focus on how development
 standards, conditions, and policies shall be applied to facilitate and
 accommodate development at the density permitted on the site and
 proposed by the development as per subdivision (f) of Section 65589.5 of
 the Government Code. The City currently exercises flexibility when
 evaluating housing proposals and is committed to working with
 developers to build new residential units which may result in
 modifications to or deviations from existing development standards. The
 City will continue to, on a case by case basis, identify ways that standards
 can be relaxed if it is determined that such requirements are in any way
 impeding the development or redevelopment of housing. The City will
 also continue to provide development standard modifications, fast track
 processing for applications related to the creation of affordable housing
 and will offer fee modifications for projects including affordable units.

                             City of Adelanto Housing Element
Incentives for extremely low income housing will be encouraged to
prioritize the development of units for this income group.
Action:
    Review annually, the City’s development standards, permit process
     and times, and required on and off-site improvements to identify
     constraints that should be removed or offset.
    As parking standards are a common constraint to the development
     of affordable housing, as part of the annual evaluation, Staff will
     specifically review, closely monitor and discuss with developers the
     City’s parking requirements for multi-family development. Based on
     the annual evaluation, the City will modify or remove constraints
     within 1 year, as necessary, to encourage multifamily development.
    Continue fast track processing, fee modifications and development
     standard modifications, on a case by case basis, when feasible.

Program 13: Extremely Low Income and Special Needs
Housing
Extremely low-income households and households with special needs
often have limited housing options in San Bernardino County. Housing
types appropriate for these groups include emergency shelters,
transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy
(SRO) units. To encourage the development of affordable units, the City
will offer a density bonus incentive, development concessions, site
improvement assistance, fast track processing, and RDA and/or HOME
funding when available. Funding opportunities and development
incentive opportunities will be prioritized for projects that include units
for extremely low- and very-low income households. The development
standards for emergency shelters are intended to encourage and facilitate
the use and only subject shelters to the development and management
standards that apply to other allowed uses with the Light
Manufacturing/Manufacturing Industrial zones. Additionally, as part of
the Governmental Constraints analysis, the following revisions to the
City of Adelanto Zoning Code, as required by State law, are identified as
appropriate to better facilitate the provision of a variety of housing types:
                                             Page 125

City of Adelanto Housing Element
 Actions:
     Amend the Zoning Code to facilitate housing opportunities for
      extremely low-income persons by establishing definitions,
      performance standards, and siting regulations for transitional and
      supportive housing development and single-room occupancy
      developments (SRO).
     The Zoning Code has been amended concurrently with the adoption
      of this Housing Element to allow transitional and supportive
      housing as a residential use.
     The Zoning Code has been amended to provide for emergency
      homeless shelters as a conditional use in the Light
      Manufacturing/Manufacturing Industrial zones. Adelanto has
      approximately 700 acres of available Light Manufacturing land and
      9,900 acres of vacant Manufacturing Industrial land. Figure 4
      identifies possible parcels between 2-5 acres that could
      accommodate an emergency homeless shelter with approximate 20
      beds. These zones are appropriate to accommodate emergency
      shelters as they are typically located along major arterial roadways
      with access to employment centers and near stores and other
      services.
     Develop additional objective standards for emergency shelters to
      regulate the following, as permitted in SB2 within the planning
      period:
            o The maximum number of beds/persons permitted to be
                served nightly;
            o Off-street parking based on demonstrated need, but not to
                exceed parking requirements for other residential or
                commercial uses in the same zone;
            o The size/location of exterior and interior onsite waiting
                and client intake areas;
            o The provision of onsite management;
            o The proximity of other emergency shelters, provided that
                emergency shelters are not required to be more than 300
                feet apart;
            o The length of stay;
            o Lighting and Security during hours that the emergency
                shelter is in operation.

Program 15: Flood Management
In accordance with Government Code Section 65302, the City shall review
and revise where appropriate the Conservation and Safety Elements to
consider flood risks when making land use decisions. Specifically, the
City shall upon the next revision of the housing element on or after
January 1, 2014, the Conservation Element shall identify rivers, creeks,
streams, flood corridors, riparian habitats, and land that may
accommodate floodwater for purposes of groundwater recharge and
storm water management.
Upon the next revision of the housing element on or after January 1, 2014,
the Safety Element shall identify information regarding flood hazards,
including, but not limited to flood hazard zones, National Flood
Insurance Program maps published by FEMA, information about flood
hazards, designated floodway maps, dam failure inundation maps, areas
subject to inundation in the event of the failure of levees or floodwalls,
etc. as listed in Section 65302(g)(2) and establish a set of comprehensive
goals, policies, and objectives for the protection of the community from
the unreasonable risks of flooding.

 Goal H.4: Promote Equal Housing
 Opportunity
 To fully meet the community’s housing needs, the City must assure that
 housing is accessible to all residents, regardless of race, religion, family
 status, age, or physical disability.
 Program 16: Reasonable Accommodation
 The Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, requires that cities and
 counties provide reasonable accommodation to rules, policies, practices,
 and procedures where such accommodation may be necessary to afford
 individuals with disabilities equal housing opportunities. While fair
 housing laws intend for all people have equal access to housing, the law
 also recognizes that people with disabilities may need extra tools to
 achieve equality. Reasonable accommodation provides a means of
 requesting from the local government flexibility in the application of land
 use and zoning regulations or, in some instances, even a waiver of certain
 restrictions or requirements because it is necessary to achieve equal access
 to housing. Cities and counties are required to consider requests for
 accommodations related to housing for people with disabilities and
 provide the accommodation when it is determined to be “reasonable”
 based on fair housing laws and case law interpreting the statues.
 Action:
     Create a process for making requests for reasonable accommodation
       to land use and zoning decisions and procedures regulating the
       siting, funding, development and use of housing for people with
       disabilities.
     Provide information to residents on reasonable accommodation
       procedures via public counters and the City website

Fair housing information is provided through the County of San
Bernardino’s Housing Authority. To assist in education and awareness of
fair housing protections the City of Adelanto will provide available
information from the County’s Housing Authority to interested residents.
The City will also revise the definition of family in the Zoning Code to
comply with federal and State housing laws. The definition shall not
distinguish between related and unrelated persons and not impose
numerical limitations on the number of persons that may constitute a
family. The City will ensure that information about specific rights is
available to all City residents by providing information on the City’s
website, at City Hall and in other public places.
Action:
    Continue to abide by and enforce fair housing laws.
    Continue to provide information to help increase awareness of fair
      housing protections
    Provide referral and assistance to people who claim to be victims of
      housing discrimination
    Establish an updated definition of family within the City’s
      Municipal Code.

Program 18: Public Information Program
The City will provide information on the housing programs to interested
residents. Information can be distributed through a variety of methods
including public discussion at City Council meetings, public hearings on
the Housing Element and General Plan Update, press releases to the local
newspapers, and/or bi-annual inserts in the water billings-informing
owners and renters of the housing programs that are available.
Information on the housing programs will also be available to residents at
the public counter at City Hall and from City Planning Staff.

 Program 19: Foreclosure Prevention
 Like most southern California communities, Adelanto is experiencing an
 increase in foreclosures in the community. To mediate the situation, the
 City directs residents to the San Bernardino County Neighborhood
 Stabilization Program which is designed to help residents purchase and
 rehabilitate affordable, foreclosed homes in eligible areas. When HOME
 and General Funds are available the City will provide foreclosure
 counseling and mediation services. Information on foreclosure assistance
 will be made available at City Hall, at the library and other public places
 The City’s partnership with the County has also led to discussions of how
 CDBG funds may be used to create additional services to prevent
 additional foreclosures.
 Action:
     Provide information on the City’s website, at City Hall and in other
      public places regarding organizations and programs that address
      how to prevent and address foreclosure if it does occur.
 Timeframe:                 Information will be added in public places
                            within a year of Housing Element adoption and
                            continually updated as necessary.

Goal H.5: Provide Adequate Sites to
achieve housing variety
Meeting the housing needs of all residents of the community requires the
identification of adequate sites for all types of housing.
                        Provide a range of different housing types and
Policy H.1.1
                        unit sizes for varying income ranges and lifestyles.
                        Encourage the provision of housing to meet the
Policy H.1.2
                        needs of Adelanto families.
Program 20: Adequate Sites
Based on units developed and approved, the City has met a portion of its
RHNA, with a remaining RHNA of 2,841 housing units, including 633
units for very low income households, 459 units for low income
households, 513 units for moderate income and 1,236 units for above
moderate income. To accommodate their remaining RHNA allocation the
City of Adelanto has identified nine housing opportunity sites totaling
approximately 610 acres that have been rezoned or are already rezoned as
identified in the Housing Resources section. The City has created two
new zones known as the High Density Residential and the Mixed Use
zone, both with a minimum density of 30 units per acre. All of the parcels
identified in the sites inventory have been rezoned, allowing for an
appropriate density to accommodate all the housing needs.
The City has identified Sites one through six and sites eight and nine in
the land inventory that exclusively accommodate residential uses. Sites
one through six and site eight allow for 30 units per acre. Rezoned sites
have been selected from the parcel listings in detailed sites tables
provided in the Housing Resources section, and will be available for
development in the planning period where water and sewer can be
provided. The City shall follow the requirements of subdivision (h) of
Section 65583.2 of the Government Code and shall ensure that owner-
occupied and rental multifamily residential development is allowed by
right in accordance with subdivision (f) of Section 65589.5 of the
Government Code.
The City will report on the progress of this rezone in its annual progress
reports required pursuant to Government Code Section 65400 and due on
                                             Page 131

 April 1st of each year. As the City must also accommodate for very low
 and low income units from the 2008-2013 and 2014-2021 planning
 periods, all inventory sites have been rezoned.
 Action:
     Continue to provide appropriate land use designations and
      maintain an inventory of suitable sites for residential development.
     Provide technical assistance and information on available parcels
      upon developer request.
     To maintain compliance with subdivision (f) of Section 65589.5 of
      the Government Code the City will ensure, through Program 13,
      that constraints to the development of affordable housing, market
      rate housing and housing for special needs groups, including
      emergency shelters are addressed and removed as necessary.
     Implement the North Adelanto 2035 Sustainable Community Plan
      within the next 18 months amending the Development Code and
      General Plan to include a new Mixed Use Zone.

 Program 21: Large Sites Program
 Most assisted housing developments utilizing State or federal financial
 resources include 50 to 150 units on parcels ranging from 3-7 acres in size.
 To facilitate the subdivision of larger parcels (>15 acres) the City will
 provide incentives and technical assistance to facilitate and encourage
 development of a variety of housing types and affordability consistent
 with typical developments affordable to lower income households. The
 City will offer on a case-by-case basis the following incentives for the
 development of affordable housing including but not limited to: priority
 processing for subdivision maps that include affordable housing units,
 expedited review for the subdivision of larger sites into buildable lots
 where the development application can be found consistent with the
 General Plan, applicable Specific Plan and master environmental impact
 report, financial assistance (based on availability of federal, State, local
 foundations, and private housing funds, and modification of
 development requirements, such as reduced parking standards for
 seniors, assisted care and special needs housing. To determine the

effectiveness of this program monitor the number of large sites available
to be developed for a variety of income groups the City will monitor this
program and assess its effectiveness on a bi-annual basis.
Action:
     The City will promote the program at City Hall, on its website and
      will evaluate requests for funding on a case by case basis. Monitor
      the program bi-annually.
     Provide technical assistance and information on available parcels
      upon developer request.

Summary of Quantified Objectives
California Housing Element Law requires jurisdictions to estimate the
number of affordable housing opportunities that will be created over the
planning period. The quantified objectives for the 2014-2021 Housing
Element presents the anticipated and potential affordable housing
development for the planning period starting on 2014 and ending 2021.
It is important to note that while the goal of the quantified objective
section is to show how the City will meet its remaining RHNA allocation,
and based on the premise that the City intends to make every effort to
achieve these goals, Adelanto cannot guarantee that these needs will be
met given limited financial and staff resources, and the increasing gap in
affordability of housing resources and incomes. Satisfaction of the City’s
regional housing needs will partially depend on the cooperation of
private funding sources and resources of the State, Federal and County
programs that are used to support the needs of the extremely low-, very
low--, low-, and moderate-income households. Additionally, outside
economic forces heavily influence the housing market. State law
recognizes that a locality may not be able to accommodate its regional fair
share housing need Table 54 presents the City’s quantified objectives in
three categories: construction of new affordable units, program assistance
and the conservation of affordable housing.
