INTRODUCTION
City of Arvin
The City of Arvin was incorporated in 1960, and is located in the southern-most portion of
California's Central Valley. The City, known as “The Garden in the Sun,” is situated in one of
the most fertile and productive agricultural areas of the nation. As a city of approximately
five square miles in size, it is surrounded by farmland and is economically dependent on
agricultural activities. The City is home to approximately 19,850 residents, and since the
1970’s, has grown by roughly 30 percent each decade. Currently, Arvin is the seventh largest
city in population of the 11 cities in Kern County — larger than the City of Shafter, but
smaller than Wasco. Figure I-1 illustrates the location of Arvin in the Kern County.
The benefits that growth and development bring to the City’s housing supply, economic well-
being and tax base are complicated by the equally important concerns of environmental
quality and natural resource protection. Arvin already faces enormous challenges pertaining
to air quality and safe drinking water; while the causes of these problems are regional in
scope and, therefore, largely outside of the City’s control, increased development will make
these issues harder to address. In addition, the level of development required to
accommodate future growth will necessitate encroachment on the agricultural areas that
support businesses that employ nearly half of all working-age Arvin residents. A balance
must exist between these priorities if the City is to grow in a healthy and sustainable manner,
and the General Plan seeks to achieve that balance.
Purpose of the General Plan
Every city and county in California is required by State law to
prepare and maintain a comprehensive planning document
                                                                     The general plan serves to:
called a general plan. The general plan is the long-range
“blueprint” for a jurisdiction and guides development                  ▪   Articulate a 15-20 year vision for the
                                                                           future growth of the City;
decisions, identifies long-term objectives for the next 15-20
years and contains policies and actions to help achieve                ▪   Identify the City’s land use, circulation,
                                                                           housing, environmental, economic, and
community goals over that period of time. The general plan                 social goals, policies and actions; and
addresses all aspects of development and community
                                                                       ▪   Provide direction in the planning and
enhancement.                                                               evaluation of future development and
                                                                           resource allocation decisions.
This General Plan will provide direction to the administrative
and legislative functions within the City and help provide
guidance to effectively determine desired development and
revitalization. In addition, the General Plan will aid in
prioritizing needed infrastructure projects in the City.

Planning Area
California State law requires that all general plans cover the area within the boundaries of
the adopting city or county and “any land outside its boundaries which in the planning
agency’s judgment bears relation to its planning.” The boundaries of the City are illustrated
in Figure I-2. In addition, each city should consider its sphere of influence adopted by the
Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) into the planning area.
The sphere of influence designates the physical boundaries and services area of a city. Each
county’s LAFCO is responsible for establishing a sphere for each city and special district in the
county. The purpose of the sphere is to act as a benchmark for future annexation decisions.
Cities cannot establish their own sphere of influence. LAFCO has sole responsibility for doing
this determination. However, a city may request that the LAFCO amends its sphere. Figure I-
2 also illustrates Arvin’s sphere of influence, which are located adjacent to the northeastern
boundaries of the city limits along Tejon Highway.
Key Supporting Documents, Other Plans and
Planning Tools
Assembly Bill 32
The State of California passed The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32).
This act commits the state to reducing ggreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 1990 levels by
2020, and to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The California Environmental Quality Act
(Public Resources Code §21000 et seq.) (CEQA) requires feasible mitigation of significant
environmental impacts arising from a city’s land use policies and development projects. The
legislation aims to reduce GHG emission through transportation and land use planning. AB 32
requires the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to adopt regulations requiring the
reporting and verification of statewide GHG emissions and to monitor and enforce
compliance. The bill requires ARB to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to
achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective GHG emission reduction.
AB 32 authorizes ARB to adopt market-based compliance mechanisms that meet certain
requirements. ARB is responsible for monitoring compliance with and enforcing any rule,
regulation, order, emission limitation, emissions reduction measure, or market-based
compliance mechanism it adopts.

Senate Bill 375
In 2008, California passed the companion bill SB 375, the Sustainable Communities Planning
Act, which provided the implementation policies to reach the GHG emission reduction goals
through integration of transportation and land use planning. It requires metropolitan
planning organizations to create a Sustainable Communities Strategy to reduce GHG
emissions and requires that funding decisions for regional transportation projects be
internally consistent with the strategy. SB 375 ties state transportation funding decisions to
land use and links regional planning efforts, such as the Kern Regional Blueprint Program
which intregrates transportation, housing, land use, economic development and
environmental planning.
As part of SB 375, the Strategic Growth Council (SGC), a state cabinet level committee
created to coordinate the sustainable planning activities of state agencies, developed the
following 12 guiding principles of sustainability:
     1.    Improve air and water quality
     2.    Promote public health
     3.    Promote equity
     4.    Increase housing affordability
     5.    Promote infill and compact development
     6.    Revitalize urban and community centers
     7.    Protect natural resources and agricultural lands
     8.    Reduce automobile usage and fuel consumption
     9.    Improve infrastructure systems
     10.   Promote water conservation
     11.   Promote energy efficiency and conservation
     12.   Strengthen the economy
In addition, the California Air Resources Board Guidance on Planning to Reduce Greenhouse
Gas Emissions provides assistance to local governments on meeting the targets for GHG
emissions. Some of the key principles include:
        Aggressive land use and transportation planning policies, including more compact,
         mixed-use development with higher residential and employment densities served by
         transit.
        Increased opportunities for more affordable and workforce housing strategically
         located in mixed-use sites near employment or public transportation.

       Programs to reduce vehicle trips, like employee transit incentives, telework
        programs, car-sharing, parking policies, public education programs and other
        strategies.
       Creation of complete neighborhoods with local services within walking distance.
       Congestion pricing strategies to provide a method of efficiently managing traffic
        demand while raising funds for needed transit, bike and pedestrian infrastructure
        investment.
       Changes in travel and land development likely to result from passenger rail
        expansion.
       Promotion of energy and water efficient buildings (LEED) through green building
        ordinances, project timing prioritization and other implementing tools.
       Promotion of green procurement and alternative fuel vehicle use through municipal
        mandates and voluntary bid incentives.
       Support for urban forestry through tree planting requirements and programs.
Kern Regional Blueprint Program
The Kern Regional Blueprint Program (“Blueprint Program”), developed by Kern Council of
Governments (KernCOG) and adopted in 2008, addresses the future of the County. KernCOG
is a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), that addresses regional transportation issues
and facilitates orderly development and growth within Kern County and its 11 incorporated
cities. The Blueprint Program is part of a larger eight-county San Joaquin Valley process,
which is designed to help regions plan for future growth and quality of life through the
integration of transportation, housing, land use, economic development and environmental
protection. The Blueprint Program calls for more compact, efficient development and the
need for multi-modal transportation improvements to reduce vehicle miles traveled and
improve quality of life. The Blueprint Program also recognizes the need to protect Kern
County’s diverse ecological spectrum which includes mountains, deserts, valleys, extensive
watersheds and agricultural domains. Elected officials from each city and county throughout
the Valley will determine how their jurisdictions will accommodate the regional vision.

Arvin Municipal Code
As required by State law, the Arvin Municipal Code
serves as the primary tool for implementing the
goals and policies of the General Plan. Title 17 of
the Municipal Code comprises the Zoning
Ordinance, which specifies permitted uses and
development standards for each zone, such as
density, minimum lot size, building heights and
setbacks, parking requirements and other
standards. The Land Use Element of the General
Plan defines the land use policies and the Zoning
Ordinance provides the detailed and specific
regulations and standards for all development
projects within the City.                                              Arvin City Hall
The development standards within the Zoning Ordinance will be updated subsequent to the
adoption of the Land Use Element. The updated Zoning Ordinance will reflect "green"
concepts, including sustainable development and energy efficiency standards and
regulations.
                                                                          Figure I-3
Enterprise Zone                                                       ENTERPRISE ZONE
In 2008, an Enterprise Zone totaling 1,116 acres was
established in Arvin. This Enterprise Zone is a specific
area targeted by the State of California for economic
revitalization, in partnership with the City and private
businesses. As part of the partnership, the State
grants incentives and benefits to businesses in the
Enterprise Zones to encourage economic growth and
job creation by offering tax advantages and incentives
to businesses locating within the zones’ boundaries.
As shown in Figure I-3, the Enterprise Zone is located
along Bear Mountain Boulevard, Sycamore Road, and
the industrial areas on Comanche Drive as well as to
the east of Derby Street. Under State law, all
development applications, including applications
within the Enterprise Zone, must be consistent with
the General Plan and comply with the development
standards of the Zoning Ordinance.

California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the State legislature in 1970
to require thorough environmental analysis of any project that might affect the environment.
Under CEQA, most projects that require discretionary approval by a public agency must first
be reviewed to determine related environmental effects.
As part of the adoption process, CEQA requires an environmental assessment of the General
Plan Update. An environmental Initial Study was prepared and the City, as the lead agency,
prepared a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) to meet the CEQA requirements.
Existing Conditions Report
As part of the General Plan update process, the City prepare the Existing Conditions Report
which examined the nature and extend of key land use, air quality and health-related issues
facing Arvin. Based on a basic understanding of these issue, goals, policies and action
programs were developed and incorporated into the General Plan. The four sections of the
Existing Conditions Report included information on: 1) the community profiles; 2) the local
and regional air quality conditions, 3) the community health; and 4) the indictors and the
built environment. The Existing Conditions Report is included in the technical appendix to
the General Plan.
Contents of the General Plan
State law requires that each general plan address seven topics: land use, housing, circulation,
open space, conservation, safety and noise. In addition, all local jurisdictions in the San
Joaquin Valley Air Basin, including Arvin, are required under AB 170 to include an air quality
element in the general plan. While a city is required to address the mandatory topics or
elements, State law offers considerable flexibility to cities and allows other topics that are
relevant to the community. California Government Code Section 65303 enables a city to
adopt “any other elements or address any other subjects, which, in the judgment of the
legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.” Once adopted, an
optional element carries the same legal weight as any of the seven mandatory elements and
must be consistent with the General Plan elements. The City of Arvin has chosen to include,
as part of the General Plan Update, the optional Community Health Element. The optional
Economic Development Element, along with the mandated Noise and Safety Elements of the
General Plan remain unchanged from the General Plan adopted in 1988. State law also
prescribes the content for each element, but allows a general plan format that best fits the
unique circumstances of the city.
The City of Arvin General Plan includes the seven mandated Elements, Air Quality Element
and the two optional Elements. Each element is briefly describe below:

Land Use Element
The Land Use Element has been updated. The Element designates the type and intensity of
uses, and general distribution of the land for residential, commercial, industrial, education,
parks, and other public uses. The Land Use Element promotes a better quality of life for its
residents and business community through policies and action programs that create
compatible uses in an attractive built environment.
Conservation and Open Space Element
This Conservation and Open Space Element, which has been updated, focuses policies on the
conservation, preservation and utilization of the City's natural resources including open
space, water resources, and sensitive environmental areas, and the enhancement of
recreational opportunities, such as neighborhood parks and recreational programs.
Housing Element
The Housing Element assesses the current and projected housing needs for all residents of
the City. In addition, it includes policies and program for maintaining and preserving
affordable housing, removing constraints in the production of new housing, providing
adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of housing, and promoting equal housing
opportunities for residents. The Housing Element is required by State law to be updated
approximately every five years. In March 2012, the Arvin City Council adopted the Housing
Element, which was subsequently certified by the State Department of Housing and
Community Development.
Circulation Element
The Circulation Element identifies the general location and extent of existing and future
major thoroughfares, transportation routes, bicycle routes and other local public utilities and
facilities. Goals and policies address issues related to improving the operation and
maintenance of citywide transportation facilities and services through the year 2030. This
Element has been updated and supersedes the Circulation Element adopted in 1988.
Safety Element
The Safety Element establishes goals, policies and measures to protect the community and
its residents from geologic, flooding and fire-related hazards. The Safety Element was
adopted in 1988.

Noise Element
The Noise Element identifies and appraises Arvin’s noise environment and establishes
acceptable noise level standards, goals and policies for different types of land uses within the
City. The Noise Element was adopted in 1988.
Air Quality Element
The Air Quality Element describes the local air quality conditions and local, regional, state
and federal air quality regulations and standards. This Element's goal is to improve the air
quality and protect the community from risks associated with chronic exposure to air
pollutants. The Air Quality Element is new to the General Plan
Community Health Element
The Community Health Element assesses the current health needs of the City. Policies
ranging from clean air, physical activity, to access to health foods promotes a healthy
environment for residents to live, work, and play.
Economic Development Element
The Economic Development Element was adopted in 1988. The key goal of this Element is to
improve the economic climate of the City by increasing employment opportunities, attracting
and retaining commercial and industrial businesses, and promoting efficient use of natural
resources while encouraging economic development in the City.
Community Participation
To accurately address community needs and values, it
is important to receive input and feedback from all
segments of the community. Community participation
in the General Plan update process included residents,
businesses and representatives from community
organizations who contributed their insight and vision
into the planning effort and helped develop the goals
and policies contained in the General Plan.
Additionally, the community participation program
provided information on the state of the City in terms
of existing conditions, recent trends and areas of need.

Community Workshops and Design Charrette
The City of Arvin, with the assistance of the Dolores Huerta Foundation and the Committee
for a Better Arvin, conducted a community workshop for the development of the Land Use,
Conservation and Open Space, Air Quality and Community Health Elements of the Arvin
General Plan. The purpose of the meeting was to hear the community's key concerns and
suggestions on addressing the issues facing the City. This meeting was held in January 2012
at the Arvin Veterans Hall. To ensure that everyone understood the planning process and
was heard, the community workshoop was conducted in Spanish and interpreted to English.
In May 2012, a four-day design charrette was conducted in the City. The design charrette
was focused on designing livable and healthy neighborhoods at two key opportunity sites
within the City. The sites included the vacant land north of Bear Mountain Boulevard
between Comanche Drive and Campus Drive and the 72-acre vacant site at Sycamore Road
and Meyer Street.
 General Plan Advisory Group
A General Plan Advisory Group was formed with key representatives of community
organizations and local agencies. The Advisory Group provided valuable social, economic,
health information and insight on issues facing the City. The Advisory Group met on a
monthly basis from October 2011 through July 2012. Goals and policies in the Land Use,
Conservation and Open Space, Air Quality and Community Health Elements were discussed
with the Advisory Group.

LAND USE ELEMENT
Introduction
The City of Arvin, a small rural town
located in the heart of California, has the
building blocks to establish itself as a
great community as it grows. However,
the City also faces significant social and
economic challenges as it looks to the
future.      The City's population has
expanded by roughly 30 percent each
decade since the 1970s, a trend that is
likely to continue at a similar rate into
the foreseeable future. This growth
should be celebrated as a sign of
increasing prosperity, as the City and its
surrounding area provide employment
opportunities and lifestyles that make                        Adriana Chavez, Sierra Vista Elementary School
Arvin a desirable place to live.
At the same time, growth and development bring challenges to the City by requiring
additional public services and infrastructure such as parks and schools, police and fire
protection, affordable housing, as well as the need to protect the environment and the
area’s productive agricultural lands. A balance must exist between these priorities if the City
is to grow in a healthy and sustainable manner, and this Land Use Element seeks to achieve
that balance.
Authority
The Land Use Element is one of the seven general plan elements the State of California has
mandated, requiring that city and county governments adopt a General Plan. Government
Code Section 65302(a) requires a land use element as part of the general plan and reads as
follows:
      “A land use element which designates the proposed general distribution and general
      location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open
      space, including agriculture, natural resources, recreation and enjoyment of scenic
      beauty, education, public buildings and grounds, and other categories of public and
      private uses of the land. The land use element shall include a statement of the
                                     City of Arvin General Plan
                                                LU-1

                                                     Land Use Element                  2012
     standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the various
     districts and other territory covered by the plan which are subject to flooding and
     shall be reviewed annually with respect to such areas.”
Purpose
The purpose of the Land Use Element is to establish the community’s vision for the future
and outline a clear but flexible policy framework for translating that vision into reality. Its
goal is to provide informed guidance for long-term decision-making that will determine the
form and extent of the City as it grows and evolves over time. In service of this goal, it
includes a set of policies and action programs that collectively form an integrated strategy to
ensure a sustainable and prosperous future for the community. These policies and actions
are anticipated to guide the City in terms of how it accommodates for physical and economic
development, and how it preserves and manages the community's precious resources.
Furthermore, the Land Use Element policies reflect the principals of sustainable communities
and SB 375, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through integrated
transportation and land use planning.
Relationship with Other Elements, Plans and
Planning Tools
Assembly Bill 32
The State of California passed AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, the
landmark climate change legislation of 2006. This act commits the state to reducing
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and to 80 percent below 1990 levels
by 2050. The California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code §21000 et seq.)
(CEQA) requires feasible mitigation of significant environmental impacts arising from a city’s
land use policies and development projects. The legislation aims to reduce GHG emission in
these two areas:
        Land Use. Land use is a significant contributor of GHG emissions, and local
         governments must make decisions regarding land use with AB 32’s goals in mind.
        General Plans. Local governments must incorporate AB 32 analysis into their general
         plans, specific plans, and other planning and design documents.
Senate Bill 375
In 2008, California passed the companion bill SB 375, which provides the implementation
policies to reach the GHG emission reduction goals through transportation and land use
planning. It requires metropolitan planning organizations to create a Sustainable
                                     City of Arvin General Plan
                                                LU-2

                                                    Land Use Element                 2012
Communities Strategy to reduce GHG emissions and requires that funding decisions for
regional transportation projects be internally consistent with the strategy. SB 375 ties state
transportation funding decisions to land use and links regional planning efforts, such as the
Kern Regional Blueprint Program for transportation and housing. The California Air
Resources Board (ARB) Guidance on Planning to Reduce GHG Emissions provides guidance
for local governments on meeting the targets for GHG emissions. Details of SB 375 are
described in the Introduction chapter of the General Plan.
Kern Regional Blueprint Program
The Kern Regional Blueprint Program (“Blueprint Program”), adopted in 2008 by Kern Council
of Governments (KernCOG), articulates a long-term vision for development and growth
within Kern County and its 11 incorporated cities. The Blueprint Program is part of a larger
eight-county San Joaquin Valley-wide process. The Blueprint Program is designed to help
member cities plan for future growth and improve the quality of life through the integration
of transportation, housing, land use, economic development and environmental protection.
The following are the guiding principles for the Blueprint Program:
       Conserve energy and natural resources, and develop alternatives.
       Provide adequate and equitable services.
       Enhance economic vitality.
       Provide a variety of housing choices.
       Use and improve existing community assets and infrastructure.
       Use compact, efficient development and/or mixed land uses where appropriate.
       Provide a variety of transportation choices.
       Conserve undeveloped land and spaces.
       Increase civic and public engagement.
Arvin Municipal Code
As required by the State law, the Arvin Municipal Code serves as the primary tool for
implementing the goals and policies of the General Plan’s Land Use policies. Title 17 of the
Municipal Code comprises the Zoning Ordinance. It specifies permitted uses and
development standards for each zone, such as density, minimum lot size, building heights
and setbacks, parking standards and others.
Community Health and Air Quality Elements
An important consideration in developing the land use policies contained in this element is
the effect they will have on Arvin’s public health and air quality, two topics that are
addressed in detail in the Community Health and Air Quality Elements of the General Plan.
Land use policies contribute to improvements in these two areas by shaping the built

environment — the physical, human-made surroundings that provide the setting in which we
live, work and play. Residents’ ability to choose whether or not to drive a car, to obtain
healthy food, and to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines are influenced by
three important characteristics of the built environment: development patterns, site and
building design, and the design of streets and public spaces.
     ▪   Development patterns that incorporate a variety of housing types and locate jobs
         and services close to neighborhoods can contribute to healthier lifestyles and reduce
         reliance on automobile travel by enabling more residents to live within walking or
         bicycling distance of neighborhood services.
     ▪   Good site design --the placement of buildings on their lots and their relationship to
         the street and sidewalk-- can contribute to the ease of non-automobile travel by
         offering safe pedestrian access and making public spaces more inviting.
     ▪   The design of streets and public spaces can make it easier for residents to get
         around without a car by including safe, pleasant sidewalks, crosswalks and bicycle
         paths, and can serve as a resource for residents to engage in physical activity and
         gather with their neighbors.
These design concepts and principles are identified in the Existing Conditions Report,
Appendix of the General Plan as areas where the City could potentially improve. Thus,
included in the Land Use Element are policies to encourage “infill” development on vacant
parcels within the City’s existing built-up area; to incorporate complementary land uses (i.e.,
residences, small groceries, public services, etc.) within new development; to require safe
and convenient pedestrian access to new buildings; and to require major new development
to incorporate innovative street designs that encourage safe driving, accommodate walking
and bicycling, and allow for sociability between neighbors. These and other policies are
intended to more effectively place Arvin on a path to improved quality of life, cleaner air, and
healthier living.
Planning for Physical and Economic Development
The City’s strategy for land use is to designate the general distribution, location, and extent
of the uses of land for residential, commercial, and industrial activities, and public uses such
government buildings, schools and parks, and other categories of public and private land
uses identified in the planning process. One of the goals in planning for physical
development is to accommodate future growth in the most sustainable and logical manner,
as well as to provide for the health and safety of its residents.
This Element is aimed to set development standards to ensure separation between
incompatible uses, and to maintain the high quality of housing and commercial development.
Physical composition not only affects the health and safety of residents, but also affects the
economic vitality of businesses within the City. Designations of land uses, particularly for
commercial development, must allow businesses to be easily accessible and industrial uses

must not only be placed safely away from residential uses, but situated and configured in a
manner that allows them to thrive and expand.
Public Health and Safety
A sustainable approach also requires that a community develop in a way that is harmonious
with its surroundings, takes into account the hazards posed by natural phenomena, and does
not expose present or future residents to excessive risks. In Arvin, such risks mainly take the
form of flooding during the storm season, as most of the City is situated in areas with
moderate probability of significant flooding. The Land Use Element incorporates policies to
guide homes and businesses away from the most flood-prone areas, emphasizing instead
recreational and other uses that can be evacuated more easily in the event of an emergency.

Land Use Designations
Land Use Element identifies how future development will occur in type and intensity and
where it will occur within the City over the next 20 years. This Element separates the city
into 12 distinct designations: Estate Residential, Residential Reserve, Low Density Residential,
Medium Density Residential, High Density Residential, General Commercial, Light Industrial,
Heavy Industrial, Parks, Public Facilities, Schools, and Agricultural. Each land use designation
is described with the type of permitted uses and a quantitative measure of permitted
intensity. The distribution of land uses is presented in Table LU-1.

          Note: Specific Plans are allowed in all land use categories.
Measuring Density and Intensity
State law requires a clear and concise description of land use categories, which includes
specified population and intensity standards. To describe the intensity of use, land use
planners have developed quantitative measures called density and intensity.
Density describes the population and development capacity of residential land. The General
Plan describes density in terms of dwelling units per net acre of land (du/ac), exclusive of
present or planned streets and other public rights-of-way.
Development intensity refers to the extent of development on a parcel of land or lot. The
General Plan’s method of defining intensity is the relationship between the total floor area of
a building and the total area of the lot. This quantification is known as the Floor Area Ratio

(FAR), which is determined by dividing the total building floor area by the total size of the
parcel. For instance, a 10,000 square foot building on a 20,000 square foot lot has an FAR of
0.5. Generally, commercial corridors along arterials are at higher intensities than
neighborhood retail developments along lower-capacity streets, and thus, better able to
accommodate the comings and goings of greater numbers of people.
As illustrated Figure LU-1, buildings with the same FAR can be designed in different ways – as
low rise building covering most of the lot, as mid-size structure with less lot coverage, or as
taller structure with ample surrounding open space.

Description of Land Use Designations
Descriptions of each of the land use designations shown on the Land Use Policy Map are
provided to delineate the general types of uses allowed and their corresponding intensities
or densities. These land use descriptions, types and limitations are defined further as specific
uses within the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
Residential Designations
Estate Residential
(Maximum Density: 1 unit per 1.25 acre)
The Estate Residential land use designation provides
for a development pattern characterized by a single-
family residential unit on a lot sizes as large as 1.25
acres. All residential development in this designation
shall be served by City sewer and water services and
shall have full urban improvements.
This land use is appropriately used when
developments are desired to promote larger-lot
homes and where the overall density of an area
should be limited because of public facility, safety or
aesthetic concerns.                                                     Estate Single Family Housing
Residential Reserve
(Maximum Density: 6 units per acre)
The Residential Reserve land use designation is applied to lands that are being actively
farmed, or have the capacity to be, but are within the planning area and proposed to be
eventually developed. This designation could also be applied to lands that contain
agriculturally-related uses, such as packing houses, cold storage operations or agriculturally-
related businesses. The purpose of this designation is to protect agriculture from urban
encroachment, maintain land in agriculture until the time is appropriate for conversion to
urban uses, and to ensure that conflicts do not arise between agriculture and urban uses.

Low Density Residential
(Maximum Density: 6 units per acre)
The Low Density Residential land use designation
allows traditional single-family homes in the City of
Arvin, with one to six dwelling units per acre. This
type of use is recognized as the backbone of the
community and is the largest land use designation in
the City. Residences in this category consist generally
of single-family detached houses with private yards.
Primary access must be from secondary, collector and
local streets. Access from major streets or major
highways should be considered only when special
design features are included.                                  Low Density Single Family Housing
Medium Density Residential
(Density Range: 7 to 15 units per acre)
The Medium Density Residential land use designation
is established to allow for quality multi-family living
environment. This category typically includes higher
density single-family residential developments or
lower density multi-family units, such as duplexes and
condominium units.
                                                              Medium Density Duplex Housing
High Density Residential
(Density Range: 16 to 24 units per acre)
High Density Residential developments consist
typically of multi-family housing projects such as
apartments and higher density condominiums. Areas
designated High Density Residential are to be
integrated through the community adjacent to
transportation, community services, and commercial
developments.
                                                               High Density Residential Apartments

Commercial Designation
General Commercial
(Maximum FAR 0.5)
The General Commercial land use designation
permits a wide range of retail, wholesale, and
service uses, as well as shopping and office
professional complexes. These commercial types
may include supermarkets, small clothing stores,
drug stores, fast-food and sit-down restaurants,
automobile service and gasoline supply, banks and
savings and loans establishments, professional
offices, medical offices and clinics, motels and
hotels, entertainment facilities, and other similar
functions.
                                                                 Retail Commercial
Industrial Designations
Light Industry
(Maximum 1.0 FAR)
The Light Industry designation allows for low-
intensity industrial use, with emphasis placed on
minimal nuisance or pollution to other uses within
the area and to adjacent districts. Permitted uses
include warehousing and storage, research and
development facilities, limited manufacturing and
other uses that are compatible with nearby
                                                                Manufacturing Facility
residential and commercial development.
Heavy Industry
(Maximum 0.5 FAR)
The Heavy Industry land use designation allows for
intensive and exclusive industrial use. Operations
and activities may be incompatible to surrounding
uses. Heavy Industry is designated in areas having
“non-sensitive” uses.       Heavy screening and
landscaping should be used.
                                                               Heavy Industrial Facility

Open Space and Institutional Designations
Parks
The Parks designation provides for a variety of
diversified recreational interests on public lands,
including parks, sporting facilities, and picnicking
areas. Recreational facilities such as the Arvin
Community Center are also included in this
designation. There are no intensity restrictions that
apply to the Parks category. Small neighborhood
pocket parks are permitted in all of the land use
designations, subject to approval by the City Council.
                                                                 Di Giorgio County Park
Public Facilities
(Maximum FAR 0.5)

facilities other than parks, including but not limited
to, city halls, public libraries, police and fire
departments. The designation also includes quasi-
public facilities such as public utility facilities,
hospitals, water wells, and similar uses.
Schools                                                              Arvin City Hall
The School land use designation allows for
educational institutions, both public and private. Lot
coverage will vary depending on needs of the facility.
Conditional use permits would allow educational
institutions to be in residential and commercial zones
depending on the intensity of use and subject to
approval by the City Council. Educational institutions
in non-school zones are generally private
establishments and include tutoring facilities, day-
care, and preschools.
                                                                  Arvin High School

Agriculture
The Arvin community is situated in the Greater San
Joaquin Valley, which is recognized as one of the most
fertile agricultural regions in the nation. The land
possesses prime soils, which, in combination with a
desirable climate condition and sufficient water
supply, create an almost ideal environment for
agricultural production. Almost one-half of Arvin’s
labor force population is employed in agriculture or
agriculture-related industries.       This designation
includes lands identified as having natural resource
amenities or characteristics.
                                                                            Agricultural Uses
Holding Capacity
Residential Capacity
Holding capacity identifies the anticipated distribution of land use acreage and population
resulting from implementation of the Land Use Element policies. In Arvin, there are
approximately 670 acres of vacant land currently zoned residential and available for
development. Over time, as properties make the transition from one use to another and as
property owners rebuild, land uses and intensities will gradually shift to align with the intent
of the Land Use Element. Table LU-3 summarizes the land use distribution for residential
property, typical level of development anticipated, and the levels of development that can be
expected from full implementation of land use policies established by the updated General
Plan. Arvin’s estimated population and housing capacity, based on the General Plan land use,
is estimated at 40,355 residents and 9,232 housing units.
Non-Residential Capacity
Table LU-4 estimates the potential future development in building square feet of
commercial, industrial and public uses within the City. These estimates are based on
assumptions of future dwelling unit densities and commercial/industrial building intensities.
According to Table LU-4 estimates, there is a potential for approximately 15.7 million square
feet of non-residential building space in the City.

                streets and other public rights-of-way as active transportation and recreation
                spaces through pedestrian-friendly design, shade trees, parkways and other
                enhancements.
Policy LU-5.2   Provide opportunities for residents to obtain healthy food locally and at low
                cost, by supporting grocery markets, farmers markets, community gardens,
                and other sources of fresh and healthy food.
Policy LU-5.3   Ensure that new development incorporates, where feasible, access to parks,
                trails and natural areas, creating a series of green corridors throughout the
                City.

          emissions.
Policy LU-7.1  Locate new medium and high density residential developments within
               walking distance of local retail, services and community facilities.
Policy LU-7.2  Encourage or facilitate the inclusion of complementary land uses not already
               present within a neighborhood district such as grocery markets, daily
               services and parks.
Policy LU-7.3  Incorporate green building practices such as on-site solar energy generation,
               water conservation and environmentally friendly building materials as part of
               new residential development.
Goal 8:   Promote residential design that responds to residents’ needs and incorporates
          amenities that increase the livability of neighborhoods.
Policy LU-8.1  Ensure that new multi-family developments include high-quality residential
               amenities such as open space, recreation, off-street parking, landscaping
               and pedestrian features.
Policy LU-8.2  Ensure site and building design provides access to natural light and air.
Policy LU-8.3  Design pedestrian and bicycle connections that support active and healthy
               living and increase accessibility to daily needs and services.
Policy LU-8.4  Maintain and enhance the value of neighborhood streets as public spaces
               that support community and social interaction through traffic calming and
               pedestrian-oriented design.

CONSERVATION AND
OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Introduction
The City of Arvin is situated in one of
the most fertile and productive
agricultural areas of the nation. The
City's economy is driven by its
agricultural community, however, since
the 1960’s, the number of Arvin
residents has more than tripled and the
demand for housing, jobs and services
have significantly increased. Arvin, like
many communities in Kern County and
the San Joaquin Valley, is struggling to
address many separate, but related,
many environmental issues, such as
water     and     air pollution,       the
preservation and management of                           Joanna Rios, Bear Mountain Elementary School
biological and cultural resources, lack of
parks and open space, maintenance and protection of open space, natural habitats, and
wildlife. Recognizing the need to protect and manage scarce resources, the City has taken a
proactive approach to addressing these issues by developing a Conservation and Open Space
Element for its General Plan.
Authority
The State of California has mandated that city and county governments adopt a General Plan.
The General Plan consists of seven required elements, two of which are addressed in this
document: Conservation and Open Space.
                                     City of Arvin General Plan
                                                CO-1

                   Conservation and Open Space Element                              2012
Purpose
The Conservation and Open Space Element layout detailed goals, policies, and action
programs for the preservation and management of biological and cultural resources, soils,
minerals, energy, air quality, and open space. The purpose of the Conservation and Open
Space Element is to promote the protection, stewardship, and use of the City’s natural
resources and to prevent wastefulness, unsustainable usage, and neglect. Furthermore, all
of the Elements of the General Plan reflect the principles of integration of SB 375, the
Sustainable Communities Planning Act of 2008 which aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions through transportation and land use planning.
Relationship to Other Elements, Plans and Planning
Tools
The inseparable relationship between the Conservation and Open Space and all other
elements in the General Plan is especially true with the mandated Circulation, Land Use and
Housing Elements. Since the City of Arvin’s vision is to ensure a sustainable, prosperous
future for Arvin that will accommodate growth and development while maintaining a
harmonious balance with the land, the City has closely created the Conservation and Open
Space Element and other elements to fulfill the City’s vision. The Conservation and Open
Space Element should serve to promote a balance between and among conflicting forces of
growth and change as represented by the other elements.
The General Plan Law and Guidelines and other laws concerning planning, zoning, and
development govern the scope and content of the Conservation and Open Space Elements
for all California cities (California Government Code §65000 et seq.). Several regional plans
and programs are also considered in the formulation, adoption, and implementation of local
land use policy and they are discussed as follows.
Arvin Municipal Code
As required by the State law, the Arvin Municipal Code serves as the primary tool for
implementing the goals and policies of the General Plan’s Land Use policies. Title 17 of the
Municipal Code comprises the Zoning Ordinance. It specifies permitted uses and
development standards for each zone, such as density, minimum lot size, building heights
and setbacks, parking standards and others.
Section 16.22 of the Arvin Municipal Code establishes a fee on new development as a
method to finance the development, improvement and enhancement of public parks. The
City will collect a park development, improvement and enhancement fee for each new
dwelling unit within City boundaries. Payment of these fees will satisfy City conditions of
                                       City of Arvin General Plan
                                                  CO-2

                 Conservation and Open Space Element                                2012
approval placed on projects with regard to park development, improvement and/or
enhancement which have not previously been satisfied.
The City of Arvin looks to adopt an environmentally focused Low Carbon Green Zoning
Ordinance within the next few years. The Low Carbon Green Zoning Ordinance aims to
promote more compact development patterns; encourage building and site design practices
that facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access and increase energy efficiency; ensure that
adjacent uses are compatible, and provide flexibility to individual development projects in
meeting these standards.
The Quimby Act
The State Subdivision Map Act, Section 66477 (The Quimby Act) allows the legislative body of
a city or county to require that development seeking approval of a final tract map or parcel
map dedicate land or pay in-lieu fees (or a combination of both) for parks and recreation.
Section 16.22 of the Arvin Municipal Code establishes a fee on new development as a
method to finance the development, improvement, and enhancement of public parks.
Federal and State Parks and Open Space Standards
The City’s supply of parks, playgrounds, and open space is subject to various jurisdictional
regulations. On the Federal level, The National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) set
the minimum standard of 2.5 acres of park space per 1,000 residents. On the State level, the
California Department of Parks and Recreation sets forth the standard of 3.0 acres of park
space per 1,000 residents.
Williamson Act
The California Land Conservation Act (Williamson Act) permits land owners of agricultural
properties to sign contracts with Cities or Counties in which the land owner agrees not to
develop their property to urban use for ten (10) year periods in exchange for having their
land assessed on the basis of its productive value rather than its full market value.
Williamson Act contracts are automatically reviewed each year for ten years unless cancelled
by either party. The cancellation thus takes ten years to become effective unless local
government approves a short cancellation. The Williamson act provides tax incentives to
encourage retaining lands in agricultural production.
Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program
The California Department of Conservation administers the Farmland Mapping and
Monitoring Program (FMMP) to monitor the status of agricultural land, particularly those
considered to be important farmland. The FMMP categorizes agricultural land according to
                                   City of Arvin General Plan
                                              CO-3

                  Conservation and Open Space Element                                   2012
soil quality and irrigation status, with the highest quality being designated “Prime Farmland.”
Other FMMP categories include “Unique Farmland,” and “Farmland of Statewide
Importance.”
Kern County Valley Floor Wildlife Habitat Conservation Plan
The Kern County Valley Floor Wildlife Habitat Conservation Plan (VFHCP) is a long-term
program designed to conserve federally protected species, State-protected species, and/or
other species of concern.
Arvin-Edison Water Storage District Program
The Arvin-Edison Water Storage District is a public state agency that relies on groundwater
storage and replenishment to wisely manage water consumption. Available water in excess
of current demand is stored in underground aquifers to be used when future water demand
exceeds availability. This program provides water supplies to District areas covering 132,000
acres of prime agricultural land, which do not have access to surface water.
Master Drainage Plan
The Master Drainage Plan ensures that proper drainage infrastructure is in place to
accommodate atypical storm periods. According to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), the entire City of Arvin and those areas in the immediate vicinity lie within
the 100-year flood zone of Caliente Creek. Located approximately ten miles northeast of
Arvin, Caliente Creek is a major drainage channel which accommodates seasonal water flow.
Caliente Creek occasionally floods the surrounding area typically flooding the southern and
southeastern portions of the City.
San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District
The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (District) is the local agency with
jurisdiction over air quality in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin. The District has adopted rules
and regulations as a means of implementing the air quality plans for the Basin. Relevant
plans include the Eight-Hour Ozone Plan, which contains an exhaustive list of regulatory and
incentive based measures to reduce emissions of ozone and particulate matter precursors in
the Valley. The plan calls for major advancements in pollution control technologies for
mobile and stationary sources of air pollution, and a significant increase in state and federal
funding for incentive-based measures to create adequate reductions in emissions to bring
the entire Valley into attainment with the federal ozone standard. The 2006 Particulate
Matter 10 Attainment Plan is an amalgamation of existing federal (EPA), statewide (ARB) and
regional (District) air quality measures. The 2006 PM10 Plan seeks to limit the impact of

harmful ambient Particulate Matter caused by construction, demolition, excavation,
extraction and agricultural activities.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund Site Cleanup
Brown and Bryant, Inc. (APN 193-130-11) This five-acre site is located in the industrial section
of the City along Derby Street. The site’s soil contains formulated liquid agricultural
chemicals. As a result of poor handling practices by the company and the contamination of
the soil and groundwater with numerous pesticides such as dinoseb, ethylene dibromide and
other fumigants, EPA listed the site in the National Priorities List (NPL) in 1989. This
contaminated site is 1,500 feet from the City of Arvin Well #1 and within three miles of other
public and private wells, which provide drinking water to 7,200 people and irrigate 19,600
acres of cropland.
Residential New Construction Program
Pacific Gas & Electric, Arvin’s utility supplier, has engaged in the Residential New
Construction Program (RNCP) to encourage the construction of energy efficient residential
units. The RNCP relies on design recommendations and market-based solutions to achieve
energy efficiency.
Green Arvin Program
The Green Arvin Program is a pilot project that translates energy conservation into economic
development. The goal of the Green Arvin Program is to demonstrate how small businesses
can save money through smart, sustainable energy consumption. This includes, recycling,
clean energy sourcing and infrastructure improvements.
Source Recovery and Recycling Element — Local Assistance Plan
The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, otherwise known as AB 939 and
administered by CalRecycle (formerly the California Integrated Waste Management Board),
established an integrated waste management program for cities, counties and regional
agencies. The act required the City to adopt an integrated waste management plan, a key
component of which was a Source Recovery and Recycling Element (SRRE) containing a
strategy for increasing recycling and reducing the amount of solid waste the City sends to
landfills. The City was required to divert 50 percent of its solid waste away from landfills by
2000, but has struggled to meet this goal.
The City is now working with CalRecycle in implementing a Local Assistance Plan (LAP) to
bring the City into compliance with AB 939. The LAP requires the City to follow through on a
number of programs in the SRRE, including its construction/demolition debris recycling

ordinance; expansion of green waste and recyclable materials collection programs for homes
and businesses; waste assessments and technical assistance for large waste-generating
businesses; an expanded school outreach effort; and a recycled content procurement policy
for all City offices. The City remains committed to implementing the LAP and other programs
to reduce the amount of materials sent to landfills.
Sphere of Influence
The sphere of influence designates the physical boundaries and services area of a city. Each
county’s Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) is responsible for establishing a
sphere for each city and special district in the county. The purpose of the sphere is to act as
a benchmark for future annexation decisions. Cities cannot establish their own sphere of
influence. LAFCO has sole responsibility for doing this. However, a city may request that the
LAFCO amends its sphere.
Existing Conditions and Policy Concerns
The conservation portion of this Element is distinguished by being primarily oriented toward
the management of natural resources, such as agricultural soils and petroleum. The open
space portion of the Element is primarily focused on preservation of existing open space and
recreational facilities within the City. This Element combines both conservation and open
space due their overlapping nature and approaches planning with a single visions. This
section addresses the following issues:
         Managed production of resources, including agricultural lands and areas containing
          major mineral deposits.
         Preservation of natural resources, including sensitive wildlife habitats and watershed
          lands.
         Public health and safety, including areas which require special management due to
          fault zones, unstable soils, or flooding.
         Outdoor recreation, including parks and recreational facilities.
Conservation and Resource Management
The City recognizes that natural resources must be maintained and managed for their
ecological and economic value, so that future generations can continue to enjoy the bounty
they provide. As stated previously, the City of Arvin is situated in one of the most fertile and
productive agricultural areas of the San Joaquin Valley. At the same time, the number of
Arvin residents has more than tripled since 1960 and the demand for housing, jobs and
services has significantly increased. A key challenge addressed in the Land Use Element is

the need to allow outward development in a phased, logical manner, so that valuable
agricultural land is not developed prematurely and parcels dedicated to farming remain
contiguous with one another.
Petroleum is another important resource; the City lies atop one of the most productive oil
fields in the area, and oil production must be carefully managed and given adequate buffer
space in order to continue contributing to the community’s economic prosperity. Impacts of
development on native plant and animal life, though rare in Arvin's predominantly urban and
agricultural landscape, must be assessed before decisions are made. Finally, clean air and
water are vital to the health and safety of the community and the Conservation Open Space
Element addresses how best to ensure that growth does not adversely affect these
important resources.
Agricultural Land and Soils
Agricultural uses within City limits cover just
over 1,000 acres, or approximately one-third
of the total land area. However, these
agricultural areas are designated and zoned
primarily for residential and industrial uses.
Because these areas are within the city
limits, they are not included in an
agricultural preserve or Williamson Act
contract. Conversion of these lands to urban
uses is likely to occur as the City grows and
development pressures take hold.
Lands outside the City boundary are
                                                               Orchards in the southern portion of the City
dominated by agricultural activities. The
area lies within Agricultural Preserve No. 13.
According to the most current agricultural preserve maps maintained by the Kern County
Planning and Community Development Department, much of the land surrounding the City
are held in agricultural preserve status and/or under a Williamson Act contract for
agricultural production. Crop types around Arvin encompass grape vineyards to the north
and east, irrigated cropland to the west, and orchards to the west and northwest. Much of
the area has been under cultivation for 75 years.
Due to the significance of its productive capability, most of the land within the Arvin area has
been continually retained for agricultural purposes. Williamson Act contracts have been
renewed on a continuous basis, and agricultural zoned land in the area has not significantly
changed. Prime agricultural land is a valuable and irreplaceable resource upon which the
economy of the Arvin area and the State of California is heavily dependent. This realization is
                                    City of Arvin General Plan

                   Conservation and Open Space Element                                   2012
reflected in state legislation encouraging farm owners and local communities to maintain as
much prime agricultural land as possible for agricultural use.
The soils in the Arvin area are well suited for intensive crop production when irrigated. The
Hesperia series soils dominate the Arvin area, particularly the Hesperia loamy fine sand and
the fine sandy loam. Their color ranges from light-grayish brown to light brown. The surface
soils are usually low in organic material and either slightly calcareous or non-calcareous. The
subsoils extend to a depth of 31 to 60 inches and are more calcareous than the surface layer.
The soils in the Arvin area generally have a fair to moderate holding capacity and have very
good drainage. These soils, which are classified as primary I and II soils under Soil
Conservation Services guidelines, are influential in the area’s recognition as a highly
productive agricultural area. The main crops associated with this soil type are cotton,
tomatoes, sugar beets, garlic, onions, grapes, and potatoes. With irrigation water available
for the area, agriculture is the dominant land use surrounding the City.
Danger of erosion of this Hesperia soil is slight, due to the low degree of slope of the land
and to the highly permeable nature of Hesperia loam. The combination of these two
characteristics results in a situation of slight water runoff. Water tends to soak into the
ground before it travels very far down slope, and thus contributes little to erosion. However,
unplanted soils would be susceptible to wind erosion.
Prime agricultural soils are a finite resource and are sensitive to adverse impacts such as
pollution, erosion, compaction and excavation. Every year agriculturally productive soils are
converted to urban uses at which point they can no longer be recovered. Farmland
conversion will reach the threshold where agricultural production can no longer absorb the
loss of land area. California possesses unique productive capabilities due to its soil and
climate conditions. The Arvin area and several other areas in the San Joaquin Valley have the
capacity to produce crops which cannot be grown elsewhere in the world. Therefore,
conservation of agriculturally productive soil is vital to the economic future of California, as
well as the Arvin area.
Agriculturally productive land is valuable not only in quantity, but also in contiguity—that is,
farmland parcels adjacent to yet more farmland parcels, rather than isolated by nonfarm-
related uses. Noncontiguous agricultural parcels lose their economic viability for sustained
agricultural use, and are effectively lost to the regional farmland base. Industrial agricultural
uses are not compatible with urban uses. The noise associated with heavy machinery, the
nuisance and health hazard associated with spraying of fields, large trucks and tractors on
public roads, dust and dirt—all are part of the agricultural use of land. Planning for existing or
proposed residential uses on nearby lands should take such activities into account and
implement way to minimize negative impacts to residents.
Therefore, the City will take care to prevent leapfrog development, as well as the premature,
unnecessary, or rapid conversion of these lands to urban uses. Higher-intensity development
of as-yet undeveloped infill sites within the existing built-up areas of the City will take
                                    City of Arvin General Plan

                   Conservation and Open Space Element                                  2012
precedence over outward growth. This approach is exemplified by the zoning of the Jewett
Square area near the center of town as a mixed-use overlay zone. Where this Element does
allow homes and businesses to encroach onto existing farmland, such expansion will proceed
in a gradual, logical manner, adjacent to existing built-up areas and close to commercial
services. This will enable the City to respond to market realities and the need for growth
without contributing to the premature loss of the agriculturally productive land that allows it
to prosper.
The City will carefully assess the feasibility of future annexations into its jurisdiction. The
benefits and costs of these annexations and future annexation requests must be carefully
weighed by local officials and the local citizenry. The City must consider whether anticipated
revenues will be sufficient to fund the additional services needed, and in terms of whether
the loss of productive farmland will be offset by the social and economic gains to the
community in the form of additional land for homes and businesses. Additionally, as a way
of mitigating the compatibility issues between agricultural and non-agricultural uses, it will
be the policy of the City to encourage organic and/or non-pesticide-using agricultural
operations within one mile of existing and proposed residential uses.
A less significant, but increasingly important, aspect of agricultural use is the small-scale
production of fruits and vegetables for home consumption, in the form of community
gardening. This practice, which involves the cultivation of small plots of land within existing
neighborhoods by groups of residents, can have a number of economic and social benefits. It
provides a way for lower-income families to maximize the value of their food budgets, as
growing produce is often cheaper than acquiring it from a store. Gardens are also
sustainable, as they reduce the need for produce that has been transported long distances
from its place of origin. Additionally, community gardens can become community-building
spaces for neighbors with a common interest in food and educational tools for children who
may not have gardens at home. These spaces can supplement Arvin's existing parks and
community centers as an additional open space resource. The City will support and
encourage small-scale gardening operations in cases where the community desires them,
including facilitating the acquisition or leasing of sites to serve as gardening space.
Groundwater Hydrology
The Arvin area overlies the Tulare Lake Groundwater Basin, which encompasses a significant
portion of the San Joaquin valley. Groundwater movement within the basin is in a south-
southwesterly direction. The local water table lies approximately 210 feet below the ground
surface.
Since 1966, the Arvin-Edison Water Storage District has engaged in a program of
groundwater replenishment. Available water in excess of current demand is percolated to

the Arvin area appear to be benefitting from the groundwater recharge program. Care
should be taken to assure the continued integrity of the groundwater basin.
The ongoing extraction of groundwater, together with oil extraction in the area, has resulted
in some land subsidence. To prevent further lowering of the land, the City of Arvin should
protect the local groundwater body from significant lowering of the water table.
Petroleum Resources
The City of Arvin lies within the boundaries of the Mountain View oil field, the highest
yielding field in the local area. A number of producing, as well as abandoned, wells exist
within the City boundaries. Figure CO-1 shows the location of these oil wells that lay within
the City. These wells, because of their scattered nature, are interspersed with agricultural
and more urbanized uses, including some wells whose property adjoins homes and
businesses.
The State Department of Conservation's Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources
maintains a database of oil wells in the Arvin area, and shows that there are currently 13
active wells within the City limits. Of these, one is located on the Arvin high school property,
another is located behind an apartment complex on Bear Mountain Boulevard, and seven
others are located an undeveloped area between Varsity Avenue and Bear Mountain that is
surrounded by residential and institutional uses. The remaining four wells are located in
outlying, non-urbanized portions of the City.
The petroleum resources in the area must be
managed wisely so as to minimize waste and
potential conflicts. Increased production of
oil resources is expected throughout the
county as the U.S. endeavor to minimize its
dependence on foreign oil. Conservation and
access to this resource for future extraction
is, therefore, critical to the economic welfare
of Arvin as well as the U.S.
Present oil drilling and potential future oil
exploration must be accommodated in land
use planning decisions, but balanced against
the pressing need to accommodate the                            Oil wells located in Jewett Square
logical growth of the City. Potential conflicts
and safety and public nuisance problems exist between oil operations and urbanized uses
such as residential or commercial. Care should be taken to allow for needed development,
while maximizing the production of valuable petroleum resources.

With these concerns in mind, most of the land currently housing active wells has been
designated for urbanized uses on the land use policy map, with the intent being to eventually
phase out oil production in this area. This land includes the nine well sites located in the
northwestern quadrant of the City, which is expected to be developed with more intense
infill uses that will be incompatible with oil production operations, for the reasons described
above. Also included are the two wells on the large lot located south of Bear Mountain on
the eastern edge of the City. This land is located less than one-half mile from the many
community services along the Bear Mountain commercial strip, and is considered a good
location for estate residential development. The remaining two wells sit on land west of
Comanche Drive in the southwestern corner of the City, are outside the existing built-up
area, and are not considered candidates for residential or commercial development during
the planning period. Thus, it is anticipated that oil production will continue on these
properties, which have been designated for heavy industrial use, a category that includes oil
and natural gas production.
For the long term, it is anticipated that the future expansion of the City will create conflicts
between oil production and more urbanized uses that cannot be anticipated on specific sites.
In these cases, it will be the policy of the City to weigh carefully the benefits of each type of
use, and to channel growth around the productive sites, if possible. One element of this
strategy will be to allow temporary recreational uses on productive sites where health and
safety considerations permit.

Natural Resources
Vegetation
The City of Arvin has been largely urbanized or cultivated in row crops. Little remains of the
original native vegetation. No rare or endangered plant species are known to exist within the
City. Presently, vegetation within Arvin consists of yard landscaping plants—such as grasses,
shrubs, and shade, fruit and ornamental trees—agricultural crops and orchards, and City-
maintained trees. These trees, which occur in parkways between sidewalk and curb, were
required by previous subdivision standards. Present City subdivision standards do not
require the planted parkway strip for new developments. Vegetation in developed areas
within the City includes ornamental landscaping maintained by the City of Arvin. Such
landscaping should be encouraged and maintained for future enjoyment of Arvin residents.
Wildlife
As a result of the removal of the area’s native
vegetation due to agricultural activity and the
expansion of urban uses, relatively few
animals native to the region occupy the Arvin
area.     Agricultural land supports some
wildlife, particularly birds, rodents and
reptiles. Two rare and/or endangered animal
species native to the southern San Joaquin
Valley include the Blunt-Nosed Leopard Lizard
(Creotophytus silus) and the San Joaquin Kit
Fox (Vulpes macrotismiticea). No known
population occur with the City of Arvin.
However, representatives of one or both                                 San Joaquin Kit Fox
species may exist within Arvin in agricultural
or open space areas. Due to the dwindling numbers of the San Joaquin Kit Fox and the Blunt-
Nosed Leopard Lizard, their preservation and protection should be of major concern.
The City will make a goal of preserving wildlife and natural habitats and ecosystems where
possible within Arvin. In support of this goal, the City will strive to incorporate areas
identified as having rare or endangered plant or wildlife into protected open space areas,
planted with native valley vegetation, to serve as wildlife habitat and natural laboratory for
public education purposes. If such plants or wildlife exists within areas with either current or
planned urban uses, the City will execute a relocation plan in order to preserve these
important resources.

Public Health and Safety
Groundwater Quality
According to the Arvin Community Services District (ACSD) the water generally complies with
primary and secondary drinking water standard of the State Department of Health.
However, evidence of arsenic and nitrate contamination has recently been detected in some
of the City’s wells at levels that exceed drinking water standards. For example, Well No. 5 in
the ACSD has been identified as having arsenic levels approaching the federal standard limit.
However, as water from all the wells is mixed within the ACSD distribution system, these
localized concentrations are diluted. Moreover, groundwater recharge sources, such as the
Kern River watershed and deliberate recharge activities by the Arvin-Edison Water Storage
District, are of high quality.
The quality of Arvin’s groundwater is of paramount importance. Every effort should be made
to keep the groundwater clean and free of harmful chemicals, so that it is fit for human
consumption and for agricultural use.
Flood Control
No significant natural bodies of water exist in Arvin. However, according to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), substantial flooding risk nonetheless is present
within the City.
The entire City of Arvin and immediately surrounding lands lie within the base flood
elevation of Caliente Creek. Caliente Creek enters the San Joaquin Valley about ten miles
northeast of Arvin. Water flow is only seasonal, but historically has encompassed large
volumes of water over short time periods, causing considerable flood damage in the
southern San Joaquin Valley. Such flooding occurred in Arvin in early 1978 and in 1983.
Other potential flood hazards exist in the form of Lake Isabella and Sycamore and Little
Sycamore Creeks. If the Lake Isabella Dam were to break, for example, as the result of an
earthquake, the ensuing water flow might impinge on the Arvin area. Another potential flood
hazard involves Sycamore and Little Sycamore Creeks. This seasonal drainage emerges from
the Tehachapi Mountains approximately four miles east and southeast, respectively, of the
Arvin community. Obstruction of one of these channels, followed by sudden release of the
collected water, might subject the Arvin area to flooding.
The majority of the developed area of the City falls within the AO flood zone, which is
considered to be high-risk. The AO zone is defined as “a river or stream flood hazard area,
and areas with a one percent or greater chance of shallow flooding each year, usually in the
form of sheet flow, with an average depth ranging from one to three feet. These areas have
a 26 percent chance of flooding over a 30-year period. Average flood depths derived from

detailed analyses are shown within these zones. The City is also under the A zone and X
zone. The A zone also represents areas of one percent annual chance of flooding, but
detailed analyses are not performed and no depths or base flood elevations are available.
The X zone represents areas of moderate flood hazard, usually the area between the limits of
the 100-year and 500-year floods. Figure COS-2 delineates the various flood zones in Arvin.
In order to minimize any potential flooding impacts and pursuant to FEMA requirements, the
Arvin Municipal Code, Chapter 15.32 (Floodplain Management) has established flood-
resistant standards for building anchoring, construction materials and methods, storage of
materials, utilities and land subdivisions. In addition, the ground floor must be raised at least
24 inches above the highest adjacent grade. With these development standards, any
potential flooding risks would be mitigated. According to Arvin’s Building Engineer, grading
fill material costs approximately $5 per square yard. Though grading cost will depend on a
site by site basis, in a typical single family home, the cost for grading would be approximately
$5,000 to $10,000 and less for new housing projects on vacant land.
A Master Drainage Plan for the City of Arvin was adopted in 1986. The plan proposes
drainage improvements to handle peak runoff flows generated within the City by a ten-year
frequency storm. Because of the undetermined base flood elevations associated with
Caliente Creek, it is uncertain whether the planned drainage improvements will be sufficient
to accommodate Caliente Creek's 100-year floodwaters. Further investigation to adequately
respond to these concerns should be performed by City Engineer of State Regulatory
Agencies. Flooding is a major concern in Arvin. Due to the community’s location within the
100-year flood zone of Caliente Creek, flood control measures must be devised and
implemented to protect life and property from damage due to flood.

Recreational/Cultural/Community
A healthy, sustainable community
requires indoor and outdoor public spaces
for people to engage in physical and social
activities. Parks, community centers and
other such facilities provide for the critical
needs (e.g., fresh air and exercise) of
residents of all ages, in addition to serving
as important spaces of interaction and
community-building.         This document
incorporates policies and action programs
that reaffirm the City’s commitment to
maintaining the high quality of its existing
resources — not only in traditional parks
and recreational areas but also on school
properties and along the City’s streets and
sidewalks — and lay out a strategy for
enhancing and expanding these resources

future residents.
Outdoor Recreation
Outdoor recreation is an important open space classification, which is essential to the
continued well being and health of community residents. As a whole, recreation is viewed as
a self rewarding utilization of time for the refreshment and renewal of body and mind. The
Arvin area maintains a variety of activities within its recreation system to accommodate the
diverse needs of the residents. The Arvin community maintains three exiting community
parks with a variety of recreational activities. Special recreational facilities and buildings
provide specialized recreational needs in addition to the outdoor activities at the park sites.
As the population increases in the Arvin area and new housing is constructed, the need for
expanded recreational opportunities becomes more evident. The City of Arvin should
encourage the development of public-owned parks and recreational areas and private
commercial recreation facilities to provide adequate recreational amenities for present and
future residents.

Recreational Open Space
The Arvin area maintains open space
areas identified for recreational
purposes, under the care of three
agencies: the Bear Mountain
Recreation and Park District, the Kern
County Parks and Recreation
Department, and the City of Arvin.
These recreational areas provide
open space amenities for the benefit
and enjoyment of users in an
urbanized setting. Arvin currently
has a park land-to-resident ratio of
2.7 acres per 1,000 residents.
Although the state does not have any
set park ratio standards, the
Statewide Park Development and
Community Revitalization Act of 2008
                                                                  Kovacevich Park
(AB 31) considers communities with
less than three acres per 1,000
residents as a "critically underserved community". Four parks exist in the Arvin area on a
total of approximately 43 acres. These parks include Di Giorgio Park, Kovacevich Park, Di
Giorgio Park, Smotherman Park, and another recently open City park that has not yet been
named. Figure CO-3 illustrates the location of these parks in the context of the City
boundaries and other public services, while Table summarizes the key characteristics of each
park.

AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
Introduction
The Bakersfield metropolitan statistical area
(MSA), which includes Arvin, had some of the
smoggiest air in the nation, according to a
report compiled by Environment California.
The Bakersfield MSA experienced 69 days in
2010 on which at least one monitor in the
area measured an ozone concentration in
excess of the 2008 national primary ozone
standard. This tied the Bakersfield MSA with
Los Angeles-Long Beach for No. 3 on the list
of the smoggiest metropolitan areas in the
                                                             Julianna Sosa, Sierra Vista Elementary School
nation.
Air quality in the Arvin area is a function of several factors. These include geographic
location, regional meteorology, and the type and quantity of air emissions in the Arvin
area. The City is situated at the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin, in
which winds flow predominantly from northwest to southeast toward the Tehachapi
Mountains. This pattern causes air contaminants from the northern portion of the
valley to drift and accumulate in the southern end of the valley. In addition, the
dispersion of air pollutants is often hindered by inversion layers, in which warmer air
layers sit on top of cooler layers, preventing the lower layers from rising and trapping
airborne pollutants.
The air pollution Arvin residents experience is not entirely due to the contaminants
drifting from northern counties to the southern end of the air basin. Local emissions,
especially those produced by mobile sources such as automobiles and trucks, greatly
affect air quality in the Arvin area. Also of significance in the Arvin area are suspended
particulate matter emissions (dust) generated primarily by cultivation of the agricultural
soils.
This means that it is within Arvin’s power to shape its own future. By adopting new and
cleaner technologies, conserving energy in homes and businesses, and providing more
mobility options to its residents besides the automobile, this community can make a
meaningful difference in the breathability of its air and the health of its people and

economy. The Air Quality Element lays out a comprehensive policy approach to achieve
this vision and to ensure that Arvin’s future includes clean air for all.
Authority
Government Code Section 65302.1 requires that each city and county within the San
Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District to amend the appropriate elements of the
general plan to include data and analysis, goals and policies to improve air quality.
Although the air quality element is not one of the seven mandated elements, State
Government Code Section 65303 states that: ”...the general plan may include any other
elements or address any other subjects which, in the judgment of the legislative body,
relate to the physical development of the county or city.“ Therefore, the City of Arvin
includes the Air Quality Element in its General Plan. Additionally, a pertinent State law
is AB 170, which requires information and policies concerning air quality to be
incorporated into the general plans of all cities and counties in the San Joaquin Valley
Air Basin, including Arvin.
Purpose
Besides the legal requirements of AB 170, the City is compelled to address the issue of
air quality due to the impact of air pollution on the health of its residents, particularly
children as they will drive a large part of the region’s future prosperity. Research has
shown that ozone and particulate matter damage lung and other tissues and lead to
increased risk of asthma, heart ailments and cancer. This Element is intended to help
the City to avoid the future adverse effects of air pollution on its social and economic
well-being. The City will accomplish this through an comprehensive policy approach
centered primarily on reducing emissions from mobile sources, as these form the largest
source category over which the City can exert control.
Relationship to Other Plans and Planning Tools
Assembly Bill 32
The State of California passed AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, the
landmark climate change legislation of 2006. This act commits the state to reducing
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and to 80 percent below 1990
levels by 2050. The California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code §21000
et seq.) (CEQA) requires feasible mitigation of significant environmental impacts arising

from a city’s land use policies and development projects. The legislation aims to reduce
GHG emission in these two areas:
       Land Use. Land use is a significant contributor of GHG emissions, and local
        governments must make decisions regarding land use with AB 32’s goals in
        mind.
       General Plans. Local governments must incorporate AB 32 analysis into their
        general plans, specific plans, and other planning and design documents.
Senate Bill 375
In 2008, California passed the companion bill SB 375, which provides the
implementation policies to reach the GHG emission reduction goals through
transportation and land use planning. It requires metropolitan planning organizations
to create a Sustainable Communities Strategy to reduce GHG emissions and requires
that funding decisions for regional transportation projects be internally consistent with
the strategy. SB 375 ties state transportation funding decisions to land use and links
regional planning efforts, such as the Kern Regional Blueprint Program for
transportation and housing. The California Air Resources Board (ARB) Guidance on
Planning to Reduce GHG Emissions provides guidance for local governments on meeting
the targets for GHG emissions. Details of SB 375 are described in the Introduction
chapter of the General Plan.
Kern Regional Blueprint Program
The Kern Regional Blueprint Program (“Blueprint Program”), adopted in 2008 by Kern
Council of Governments (KernCOG), articulates a long-term vision for development and
growth within Kern County and its 11 incorporated cities. The Blueprint Program is part
of a larger eight-county San Joaquin Valley-wide process. The Blueprint Program is
designed to help member cities plan for future growth and improve the quality of life
through the integration of transportation, housing, land use, economic development
and environmental protection. The following are the guiding principles for the Blueprint
Program:
       Conserve energy and natural resources, and develop alternatives.
       Provide adequate and equitable services.
       Enhance economic vitality.
       Provide a variety of housing choices.
       Use and improve existing community assets and infrastructure.
       Use compact, efficient development and/or mixed land uses where appropriate.
       Provide a variety of transportation choices.

        Conserve undeveloped land and spaces.
        Increase civic and public engagement.
San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District
The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (District) is the local agency with
jurisdiction over air quality in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin. The District has adopted
rules and regulations as a means of implementing the air quality plans for the Basin.
Relevant plans include the Eight-Hour Ozone Plan, which contains an exhaustive list of
regulatory and incentive based measures to reduce emissions of ozone and particulate
matter precursors in the Valley. The plan calls for major advancements in pollution
control technologies for mobile and stationary sources of air pollution, and a significant
increase in state and federal funding for incentive-based measures to create adequate
reductions in emissions to bring the entire Valley into attainment with the federal ozone
standard. The 2006 Particulate Matter 10 Attainment Plan is an amalgamation of
existing federal (EPA), statewide (ARB) and regional (District) air quality measures. The
2006 Particulate Matter Plan seeks to limit the impact of harmful ambient particulate
matter caused by construction, demolition, excavation, extraction and agricultural
activities.
Green Arvin Program
The Green Arvin Program is a pilot project that translates energy conservation into
economic development. The goal of the Green Arvin Program is to demonstrate how
small businesses can save money through smart, sustainable energy consumption. This
includes, recycling, clean energy sourcing and infrastructure improvements.
Infrastructure improvements are encouraged through a variety of utility, state and other
incentives as well as Valley CAN grants.
Air Quality Issues
Geography and Climate
The City of Arvin lies within the southern portion of the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin
(“Basin”). Air quality has been a serious issue in the San Joaquin Valley because of its
topography, climate, and growing population.
The physiography of the southern San Joaquin Valley is a significant factor in the air
basin’s limited ability to dilute and disperse air contaminants. For the majority of the
                                   City of Arvin General Plan
                                              AQ-4

                                            Air Quality Element                 2012
Basin, air movement is restricted by the hills and mountains surrounding it. Although
marine air flows into the basin from the Delta, the Coast Range hinders wind movement
into the Basin from the west, the Tehachapi Mountains prevent the southerly passage of
airflow, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains are a significant wind barrier to the east.
These topographic features create a weak airflow pattern that becomes blocked
vertically by high barometric pressure over the Basin. As a result, the majority of the
Basin is highly susceptible to pollutant accumulation over time.
Air Pollutants in the San Joaquin Valley
The following section summarizes the pollutants of greatest importance in the San
Joaquin Valley. It provides a description of the pollutants’ physical properties, health
effects, sources and the extent of the problems.
In general, primary pollutants are directly emitted into the atmosphere, and secondary
pollutants are formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Air pollution in the
Valley results from emissions generated in the Valley as well as from emissions and
secondary pollutants transported into the Valley. It is thought that the bulk of the
Valley’s summer and winter air pollution is caused by locally generated emissions. Due
to the Valley’s meteorology, topography, and the chemical composition of the air
pollutants, NOx is the primary culprit in the formation of both ozone and PM2.5.
Ozone – Ozone (O3) and particulate matter are the two pollutants that are responsible
for the bulk of the Valley’s air quality problems. Ozone is the major component of the
Valley’s summertime “smog,” and it affects human health and vegetation. Ozone is not
emitted directly into the air, but is created by a series of chemical reactions between
reactive organic gases (ROG) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) that take place in the
presence of sunlight. ROG and NOx are emitted from fuel combustion, agricultural
processes, and industrial processes that are widespread throughout the Valley as well as
from natural sources. Studies have also linked urban areas with both higher regional
temperatures and higher ozone levels (a phenomenon known as the “urban heat island
effect”).
High concentrations of ground level ozone can adversely affect the human respiratory
system and aggravate cardiovascular disease and many respiratory ailments. Ozone
also damages natural ecosystems such as forests and foothill communities, agricultural
crops and some man-made materials, such as rubber, paint and plastics.
Reactive Organic Gases – Reactive organic gases (ROG), also known as volatile organic
compounds (VOC), are photochemically reactive hydrocarbons that are important for
ozone formation. The primary sources of ROG are petroleum transfer and storage, oil
and gas production, mobile sources, organic solvent use, farming operations, and
                                  City of Arvin General Plan
                                             AQ-5

                                            Air Quality Element                  2012
miscellaneous processes. No separate health standards exist for ROG as a group.
Because some compounds that make up ROG are also toxic, like the carcinogen
benzene, they are often evaluated as part of a toxic risk assessment.
Oxides of Nitrogen – Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) are a family of gaseous nitrogen
compounds and are precursors to the formation of ozone and particulate matter. The
major component of NOx, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), is a reddish-brown gas that is toxic at
high concentrations. NOx results primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels under
high temperature and pressure. On-road and off-road motor vehicles and fuel
combustion are the major sources of this air pollutant.
Particulate Matter – Particulate matter (PM) is any material except pure water that
exists in the solid or liquid state in the atmosphere. Suspended particulate matter
(airborne dust) consists of particles small enough to remain suspended in the air for long
periods. Respirable particulate matter consists of particles small enough to be inhaled,
pass through the respiratory system, and lodge in the lungs with resultant health
effects. Respirable particulate matter includes “inhalable coarse particles,” with
diameters larger than 2.5 micrometers and smaller than 10 micrometers (PM10), and
“fine particles,” with diameters that are 2.5 micrometers and smaller (PM2.5).
PM10 and PM2.5 are primary pollutants (emitted directly to the atmosphere) and
secondary pollutants (formed in the atmosphere by chemical reactions among
precursors. Generally speaking, PM2.5 sources tend to be combustion sources like
vehicles, power generation, industrial processes, and wood burning, while PM10
sources include these same sources plus roads and farming activities. Fugitive
windblown dust and other area sources also represent a source of airborne dust in the
Valley.
Acute and chronic health effects associated with high particulate levels include the
aggravation of chronic respiratory diseases, heart and lung disease, and coughing,
bronchitis, and respiratory illnesses in children.
Carbon Monoxide – Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that is highly
toxic. It is formed by the incomplete combustion of fuels and is emitted directly into the
air (unlike ozone). The main source of CO in the San Joaquin Valley is on-road motor
vehicles. Other CO sources in the Valley include other mobile sources, industrial
processes such as metallurgy, and fuel combustion from stationary sources.
Because of the local nature of CO problems, the ARB and EPA designate urban areas as
CO nonattainment areas instead of the entire basin as with ozone and PM10. Motor
vehicles are by far the largest source of CO emissions. Emissions from motor vehicles
have been declining since 1985, despite increases in vehicle miles traveled (VMT), with
the introduction of new automotive emission controls and fleet turnover.

Other airborne pollutants in the Basin include sulfur dioxide and lead. Emissions of
these pollutants, which are mainly a product of fuel combustion in on-road vehicles,
have lessened over time as their use in fuels has been phased out. Neither pollutant is
currently considered to be a significant problem for air quality in the San Joaquin Valley.
Local Air Quality Conditions
Arvin’s air quality has generally improved over the last several years. During the five-
year period 2006 to 2010, the area experienced fewer days in excess of State standards
for 1-hour ozone, 8-hour ozone, and 24-hour PM10 (estimated) in 2010 than in any
other year in this period. This trend reflects improvements observed District-wide, as
2010 saw the fewest State nonattainment days for 1-hour ozone, 8-hour ozone and
PM10 (estimated) and the fewest estimated days exceeding the federal standard for
PM2.5 of any year in the five-year period. Detailed information on local ambient air
quality in Arvin can be found in the Existing Conditions Report, Technical Appendix to
the General Plan.
Despite these observed improvements, air pollution remains a serious problem in the
Arvin area, as pollutant concentrations exceed State and Federal standards with
unacceptable frequency. As mentioned in the Introduction section of the Air Quality
Element, ozone concentrations dropped in 2010 compared to previous years; however,
the Bakersfield MSA, which includes Arvin, had some of the smoggiest air in the nation.
The Bakersfield MSA experienced 69 days in 2010 on which at least one monitor in the
area measured an ozone concentration in excess of the 2008 national primary ozone
standard, which tied the Bakersfield MSA with Los Angeles-Long Beach for No. 3 on the
list of the smoggiest metropolitan areas in the nation. The ten Red Alert days was
second only to Riverside-San Bernardino for the highest number of any MSA nationwide.
Mobile Source Emissions
Mobile source emissions are a substantial portion of the pollutant inventory in the San
Joaquin Valley. Mobile sources consist of on- and off-road motor vehicles, trains, boats,
aircraft, construction equipment, farm equipment, and other vehicles propelled by
motors. At the scale of both Kern County and the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin as a
whole, mobile emissions, which account for slightly more than one third of human-
generated reactive organic gas emissions (one of the main ingredients in smog) in both
the County and the Air Basin, as shown by Figure AQ-1. Mobile sources are also notable
(and sometimes dominant) sources of other anthropogenic pollutants within the
County, accounting for approximately 16 percent of toxic organic gases, 83 percent of
carbon monoxide, 77 percent of nitrogen oxides, 12 percent of PM10, and 31 percent of

PM2.5 emissions (all excluding natural source emissions). This makes mobile sources a
potentially promising avenue for reducing the City’s contribution to regional air
pollution across a broad range of pollutants.

Other Emission Sources
Other emission sources include point (or stationary) sources, area-wide sources, and
natural sources. Within Kern County, point/stationary sources make up the largest
category of human-generated emissions, at 43 percent. They are regulated by the Air
District and can only be controlled by the City in the form of land use regulations that
permit or prohibit the type of business that typically generates these types of emissions.
Because these businesses provide needed employment opportunities and contribute to
the City’s tax base, it is undesirable to ban them outright; instead, the City’s land use
policies will focus on separating emissions-generating businesses from residential areas
and sensitive receptors. For this reason, it is the second largest source category at 35
percent that commands most of the City’s attention as a potential avenue for reducing
emissions.
Facilities that have valid Air District permits are called point sources or stationary
sources. Refineries, gas stations, dry cleaners and industrial plants are examples of
                                            City of Arvin General Plan

point sources in the San Joaquin Valley. The operators of these sources submit detailed
information to the Air District, which maintains a database. Almost all facilities with
emission greater than 2.5 tons/year of any air pollutant are included.
Area-wide source emissions are from sources that are not regulated by the Air District,
or are individually very small emitters that may not be included in the District’s survey
system. These small sources may not individually emit significant amounts of pollutants,
but in aggregation area-wide sources can make appreciable contribution to the emission
inventory. Examples of area sources are residential water heating and use of paints,
varnishes, and consumer products. Emissions from these sources are grouped into
categories and calculated based on surrogate variables.
Natural sources include wildfires, windblown dust, and biogenic emissions from plants
and trees. Emissions from natural sources are estimated by ARB.
Land Use Regulation and Development Patterns
Land use regulations influence the distribution of housing, employment centers, and
other land uses within a community. The widespread distribution of different land uses
affects the way individual residents choose to travel to various destinations within the
community; the current orientation of the City’s land use patterns toward automobile
travel means that driving is the only option for many residents.
The patterns of land uses found in a community are directly tied to the prevalent form
of transportation available at the time the area was developed. Urban areas established
before the age of the automobile were often developed around a railroad station or
streetcar stop with most residential and commercial uses located within walking
distance of the station. After World War II, however, automobile ownership became
much more widespread as the United States experienced unprecedented economic
growth and prosperity. New residential development could appear anywhere a car
could reach. Suburban shopping malls were developed away from existing homes and
downtown commercial areas. Parking lots began to be placed prominently in front of
new commercial development. The practice of using cul-de-sacs in subdivision designs
and limiting access from major arterial and collector streets further separated
residences from frequently needed goods and services.
After more than 50 years of automobile-oriented development, the personal
automobile now accounts for the vast majority of our daily trips. (U.S. Department of
Transportation 1999). This is driven by necessity, due to the increased physical
separation between home, work, school and retail commerce. Driving is often the only
way to get to one’s workplace in a timely manner. Most parents must act as chauffeurs

                                             AQ-9

                                             Air Quality Element                     2012
for their children, shuttling them to school, to little league, to fast food, or to day care.
Most destinations are perceived as unsafe for children to walk or to bicycle due to the
lack of sidewalks and/or high vehicle speeds.
The community orientation to the automobile is not without benefits. People enjoy
having quiet residential neighborhoods, with commercial and industrial employment
sites situated well away from their homes. However, if Arvin wishes to reduce mobile
source emissions, the City as a whole will need to address the overwhelming reliance on
automobiles, and to increase the range of options available to Arvin residents. Land use
patterns and transportation systems must continue to allow people to efficiently use
their cars, but also must provide an environment where walking, bicycling and transit
use are practical, safe and enjoyable alternatives for meeting mobility needs.
The City of Arvin plans to achieve these objectives in a number of ways. An important
land use strategy will be to prioritize “infill” development on vacant sites within the
boundaries of the City’s existing built-up area rather than expansion onto adjoining farm
land. This will ensure new residents are near existing retail commerce and public
services and will not need to travel farther to meet their daily needs. The largest
opportunities for such development are the planned Jewett Square area (north of Bear
Mountain Boulevard, west of Campus Drive) and the two large vacant sites at the
intersection of Meyer Street and Sycamore Road). Beyond these major development
sites, which are discussed in detail in the Land Use Element of the General Plan, this Air
Quality Element contains numerous policies stating the City’s commitment to ensuring
site and building designs that prioritize safe, convenient pedestrian access, as well as to
developing a network of bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly streets that reduce the stress,
discomfort and danger of non-motorized travel in Arvin neighborhoods.
Energy Conservation in Building Construction and
Operations
Another potential avenue for reducing City emissions is the reduction of the amount of
energy consumed in building, maintaining, operating, heating and cooling homes and
businesses in Arvin. Natural gas-burning appliances used for space heating, water
heating and cooking are a sizable source of NOx emissions. The consumption of
electricity also causes pollutant emissions from the operation of power plants fueled by
fossil fuels. Local efforts to reduce energy consumption can save consumers money and

COMMUNITY HEALTH
ELEMENT
Introduction
The City of Arvin, a small town that is driven
by its agricultural community, is located in
one of the most productive areas of
California.     However, the City faces
numerous environmental challenges and
health-related issues. Arvin, as well as
many communities in Kern County and the
San Joaquin Valley are struggling to address
these interrelated issues, such as how the
community's health is impacted by air and
water pollution, dependency on cars, lack
of physical activity and accessibility to
medical care and healthy food. Recognizing
that there are critical health risks in the
community and that the City can take a                         Brisa Valencia, Sierra Vista Elementary School
proactive approach solving these issues, the
City has developed a Community Health
Element for its General Plan. This Community Health Element primarily addresses concerns
that relate to the built environment, as well as identifying programs that will educate,
support, and encourage a healthy lifestyle.
Authority
The State of California has mandated that city and county governments adopt a General Plan.
The General Plan consists of seven required elements and gives the flexibility to include
optional elements. The California Governmental Code Section 65303 enables a county or city
to adopt “any other elements or address any other subjects, which, in the judgment of the
legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.” The Community
Health Element is not a required element in the General Plan, but including the Community
Health Element enhances and supports the City’s vision of a sustainable and prosperous
future.

Purpose
The purpose of the Community Health Element is to establish the community's vision for the
future and outline a clear but flexible policy framework in regards to the community’s health.
Its goal is to provide informed guidance for long-term decision-making that will encourage
and support improved health and quality of life in the City as it grows and evolves over time.
In the service of this goal, the Element includes a set of policies and action programs that
collectively form an integrated strategy to ensure a sustainable and prosperous future for the
community. These policies and actions are anticipated to guide the City in terms of how the
design of the built environment is to enrich the health of the community, how it conserves
the City’s resources and how it maintains and expands its recreational and cultural resources.
This planning effort will occur in conjunction with developing air quality, land use and
transportation policies and within the context of the Sustainable Communities Strategy to
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as required by SB 375. The City’s focus on providing
effective transportation and land use policies can change the built environment to reduce air
pollution emission and promote healthy active lifestyles. The built environment is all the
physical, human-made surroundings that provide the setting in which we live and work (e.g.,
homes and buildings, streets, and parks). An example of how the built environment can
affect public health when the unavailability of assessable sidewalks and bicycle or walking
paths becomes a factor of physical inactivity. Lack of physical activity can lead to poor health
outcomes such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer.
Relationship to Other Elements, Plans and Planning
Tools
As stated previously, that the Community Health Element is an optional element, but must
still comply with all other elements and policies that have been adopted by the City in
accordance with the California Governmental Code Section 65300.5, which states,
      “In construing the provisions of this article, the Legislature intends that the general
      plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated, internally consistent
      and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency.”
The Community Health Element comply with all other general plan elements, especially the
Land Use Element policies. Additionally, there are several regional plans and programs that
are also considered in the formulation, adoption, and implementation of local land use
policies as well as the sustainability principles of the Strategic Growth Council, the California
Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32), the Sustainable Communities Planning Act (SB
375) and the Kern Regional Blueprint Program, which are all describe in the Introduction
chapter of the General Plan.

The Built-Environment and Health
An important consideration in developing the Community Health Element is the effect of its
policies on Arvin’s public health. By shaping the built environment, the City can contribute to
healthier community lifestyles and reduce reliance on automobile travel by enabling more
residents to live within walking or bicycling distance of neighborhood services. These changes
can help reduce pollutant emissions from mobile sources and make it easier for resident to
incorporate physical activity into their daily routine. Residents’ ability to choose whether or
not to drive a car, to obtain healthy food, and to incorporate physical activity into their daily
routines are influenced by three important characteristics of the built environment:
development patterns, site and building design, and the design of streets and public spaces.
        Development patterns that incorporate a variety of housing types and locate jobs
         and services close to neighborhoods can contribute to healthier lifestyles and reduce
         reliance on automobile travel by enabling more residents to live within walking or
         bicycling distance of neighborhood services.
        Good site design --the placement of buildings on their lots and their relationship to
         the street and sidewalk — can contribute to the ease of non-automobile travel by
         offering safe pedestrian access and making public spaces more inviting.
        The design of streets and public spaces can make it easier for residents to get
         around without a car by including safe, pleasant sidewalks, crosswalks and bicycle
         paths, and can serve as a resource for residents to engage in physical activity and
         gather with other community members.
These design concepts and principles are further explained in the Existing Conditions Report
for the Community Health and Air Quality elements as areas where the City could potentially
improve.
The street network, while offering smooth and
efficient automobile travel, should also enable
and encourage users to meet their mobility
needs by means other than the private
automobile, and should serve as a resource for
residents to engage in physical activity. To the
greatest extent possible, streets should be
designed to enhance the safety, comfort and
convenience of people who are not drivers,
whether they are too young or too old to drive,
physically unable to drive, lack access to a
vehicle, or have chosen not to drive for a
particular trip. In order to encourage healthy
lifestyles and reduce reliance on automobiles, the                 Pedestrian walkways in Jewett Square
                                    City of Arvin General Plan

City must incorporate pedestrian- and bike-friendly designs into the street network. The use
of alternative transportation such as bicycles, walking, and public transportation may both
reduce carbon emissions produced by cars and provide physical activity for people. The City’s
policies pertaining to the built environment will look to encourage these modes of
transportation by making these processes safe, easy to access and enjoyable.
Health Issues Facing Arvin
Air Quality and Asthma
The physiography of the southern San
Joaquin Valley is a significant factor in the air
basin’s limited ability to dilute and disperse
air contaminants. Within the majority of the
San Joaquin Valley Air Basin, air movement is
restricted by the hills and mountains
surrounding it. Although marine air flows
into the Basin from the San Joaquin Delta,
the Coast Range hinders wind movement
into the Basin, the Tehachapi Mountains
prevent the southerly passage of airflow,
and the Sierra Nevada Mountains create a
significant wind barrier to the east. These
topographic features create a weak airflow
                                                                Yisel Para, Sierra Vista Elementary School
pattern that becomes blocked vertically by
high barometric pressure over the Basin. As
a result, the majority of the Basin is highly susceptible to pollutant accumulation over time.
Air pollution Arvin is not entirely due to the contaminants drifting from northern counties to
the southern end of the Basin. Local emissions, especially those produced by automobiles
and trucks, greatly affect the Arvin area. Also of significance in the Arvin area are suspended
particulate matter emissions (dust) generated primarily through the cultivation of the
agricultural soils.
Automobile emissions contribute greatly to the creation of smog—photochemical oxidants
created by chemical interactions in the presence of sunlight. Ozone is one of the primary
photochemical oxidants and is a major pollutant in the air of the southern San Joaquin Valley.
Currently, the Kern County portion of the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin experiences violations
of both state and federal air quality standards for ozone and suspended particulate matter.
Another, large scale air quality issue affecting Arvin is that of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global climate change. The
presence of GHGs in the atmosphere regulates the earth's temperature; however, it is
                                     City of Arvin General Plan

                                    Community Health Element                            2012
believed that emissions from human activities, such as electricity production and vehicle use,
have elevated the concentration of those gases beyond naturally occurring concentrations
and are contributing to the gradual warming of the earth's climate.
The negative effects of air pollution on human health and the environment have been known
for many years. Studies have shown how ozone and particulate matter damage lung and
other tissues and lead to an increased risk for asthma, heart ailments, and cancer. According
to the American Lung Association, the San Joaquin Valley is home to more than 10 percent of
California’s population and represents 13 percent of California’s criteria pollutant emissions.
In its 2011 State of the Air report, the Association found that the Bakersfield-Delano
Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Arvin, ranked highest in short-term and year-
round fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) and second-highest in ozone levels. In 2008, ozone
levels in Kern County exceeded the regulatory standards on 106 days — only San Bernardino
County was higher with 117 days, while Riverside County equaled number of days at 106.
During the same year, the annual average particulate matter concentration in Kern County
was 23.5 micrograms per cubic meter, which is considerably higher than the 15.0 micrograms
per cubic meter standard. Any particulate matter concentrations over the standard are
considered potentially harmful.
Water Quality
Water quality is also a key issue for the City of Arvin. The level of arsenic found in the public
drinking water was over 50 parts per billion (ppb) in the northwestern portion of the City.
Arsenic is a known carcinogen, and drinking high levels of it over many years can increase the
chance of cancer and other diseases. The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
ordered the Arvin Community Services District to lower the arsenic levels to federal Safe
Drinking Water Act’s arsenic standard of 10 ppb. Within the City of Arvin, the Brown and
Bryant site (APN 193-130-11) located at 600 Derby Street is identified on the National Priority
List. This site covering approximately five acres, contains formulated liquid agricultural
chemicals. As a result of poor handling practices by the company and the contamination of
the soil and groundwater with numerous pesticides such as Dinoseb C, ethylene dibromide
and other fumigants, the EPA added the site to the NPL in 1989. The contaminated site is
located approximately 1,500 feet from the City of Arvin Well #1 and within three miles of
other public and private wells, which provide drinking water to 7,200 residents and irrigate
19,600 acres of cropland. This site is also identified on the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Information System (CERCLIS), the California
Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) Calsites, the Site Mitigation and Brownfields
Reuse Programs Database (SMBRPD) and the Hazardous Waste and Substances Site List
(Cortese List AB 3750).

Tobacco Control
According the American Lung Association, tobacco use is the number one preventable cause
of death and disease in California. Despite significant gains in the last 20 years, four million
Californians still smoke, and smoking kills nearly 40,000 people every year. The State of
California aims have smoke free outdoor air, smoke free housing, and reducing sales of
tobacco products. The State have passed several legislative policies that pertain to
prohibiting smoking in public areas such as places of employment, schools, enclosed bars and
restaurants, health care facilities, and child care facilities. In addition, the State has several
laws regarding restricting minors from purchases and possessing tobacco, holding tobacco
retailers accountable to selling to minors. More recently, the State has passed SB332, which
makes it explicit that landlords have the right to make their rental properties smoke free.
The American Lung Association’s State of Tobacco Control 2012 report tracks progress on key
tobacco control policies at the state and federal levels. The report assigns grades to the
states in four key areas — tobacco prevention and control spending, smokefree air, cigarette
tax and cessation coverage. According to this report, both the County and the City had
unsatisfactory reports. Recently, the County has implemented a tobacco retailer’s permit
ordinance and a comprehensive outdoor secondhand smoke ordinance which is in review.
The Kern County Housing Authority is planning to implement a 100 percent smoke free policy
for all the facilities owned or managed starting July 1, 2012. In efforts to be aligned with the
State and County goals in tobacco control, the City will adopt similar policies in the health
element.
Obesity and Lack of Physical Activity
One of the greatest public health concerns in
the United States is obesity. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
considers obesity as the number one health
risk in the nation, with approximately one-
third of the adult population defined as
obese. Obesity is a growing health concern
because it is linked with many types of
chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart
disease, hypertension and stroke.            It is
estimated       that     obesity    results     in
approximately 400,000 deaths a year
nationwide and costs the national economy
over $120 billion annually. The San Joaquin
Valley counties have some of the highest
adult obesity rates in the state. Lack of                                Bike lane on Campus Drive

physical activity is one of the main factors of obesity. Some of the barriers to living an active
lifestyle are:
        Time spent in front of TV and computers doing work, schoolwork, and leisure
         activities
        Reliance on cars instead of walking or bicycling for local travel
        Lack of sidewalks in local neighborhood
        Lack of bicycle access or poor bicycle access
        Lack of access to parks, trails, sidewalks, and affordable gyms
        Lack of time
        Increased employment in the service industry and desk jobs that involve little
         physical activity
Many of these barriers discouraging an active lifestyle are a result of the built environment.
In addition, reliance on automobile travel contributes to an increase in physical inactivity.
Contrastingly, walking, bicycling and the use of public transit are signs of an active
population.
Food and Nutrition
While genetics, age, pregnancy and other
factors may contribute to becoming overweight
or obese, it is generally accepted that too much
food — especially widely marketed fast food
and junk food — and too little exercise are the
main causes. Therefore, both nutrition and
physical activity are critical to control the
obesity epidemic.
The nutrition side of the obesity equation must
include the availability of fresh food products
and the accessibility to food outlets, such as
grocery stores. The California Center for Public
Health Advocacy found the following

health:
        Where there are high numbers of fast-food restaurants compared to grocery stores,
         there are higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.
        People who live near supermarkets are more likely to eat more fruits and vegetables
         and less likely to be obese.

        Eating at fast-food restaurants is associated with consuming more calories and fewer
         vegetables; it is also associated with higher rates of obesity.
        People consistently underestimate how many calories are in fast-food meals.
According to the California Health Interview Survey, approximately 75 percent of the
residents of Kern County consumed fast food at least once a week and the County also has
about four times the number of fast food restaurant and convenience stores to the number
of supermarkets and produce vendors. Similarly, the California Center for Public Health
Advocacy conducted a study of type of food retailers in communities around the state. The
study found that in Bakersfield had the highest concentration among the state’s largest cities
According to recent market study of health-related establishments, Bakersfield has six fast
food restaurants and convenience stores for every one grocery store, farmers market, or
produce store, and at the same time, has one of the highest levels of obesity and diabetes in
the state. In comparison, the City of Arvin has over eight fast food and convenience stores to
markets and produce vendors. There are seven fast food establishments and 11 convenience
stores and only two markets that sell fresh meats and produce in the City. The market study
indicates that there is a lack of establishments that provide fresh produce and an excess of
convenience stores.
Although Arvin is located in one of the most fertile and productive agricultural areas in the
state, the City lacks fresh produce and healthy restaurants. Alternative food markets such as
farmers’ markets or community gardens are an affordable way of accessing healthier foods.
However, there are currently no farmers' markets or community gardens in the City. The
nearby community of Lamont has a farmers' market that operates once a week during the
summer months. Bakersfield has six farmers' markets within the city that operate once or
twice a week. Two markets operate year round. Smaller communities such as Delano,
Shafter, Rosedale and Tehachapi all have farmers' markets.

                                              Implementation Plan                    2012
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
The City of Arvin General Plan 2012 establishes the foundation and policy framework for guiding
Arvin’s future development. The General Plan establishes official goals and policies related to
community development, resources, health and safety. This Implementation Plan identifies
specific actions the City will take to implement the General Plan’s policies. Its purpose is to
serve as a reference for City staff and decision makers as they strive to put these policies into
effect in the form of ordinances, programs and practices. The Implementation Plan will be
updated as often as necessary to ensure that it reflects the City’s policy priorities and available
resources. In addition, the Implementation Plan will be updated whenever the General Plan is
amended in order to ensure that it remains consistent.
The following actions will put the General Plan goals and policies into effect. Many of these
actions help to implement policy priorities identified in more than one element; for example,
Action 3, which concerns placing new residential development within walking distance of retail
commerce and neighborhood services, addresses land use policies concerning compact
development, community health policies concerning physical activity, and air quality policies
concerning non-polluting transportation. Therefore, because of these overlapping relationships,
actions are not grouped according to the various individual General Plan elements, but by a set
of nine focus areas that address specific topics, some of which are common threads that run
through multiple elements.
The responsible agency and/or City department for each action is identified, as well as the
recommended time frame and funding source. Time frames for each action are primarily either
“short-term” (one to five years from plan adoption) or “long-term” (after five years, but within
the General Plan’s 15 to 20-year time horizon). Activities that are anticipated to be sustained
over the entire planning period are shown as “ongoing.”
