INTRODUCTION
This Element of the General Plan describes
the various means by which residents,
businesses, and visitors in Atwater travel
through the City. The most common means
of transportation is the automobile (and trucks
for business and industry). However, this
Element deals with transportation in all its
forms, including bicycles, walking, trains, and
airplanes. The intent is to provide an
overview of all the means of transport, and to
show how these different methods can
complement each other to make Atwater’s
circulation system work more efficiently.
The topics addressed in this Element are:       The City is linked to Merced and Sacramento

HARBORS AND FISHERIES
Under state law, the Conservation Element is
required to discuss harbors and fisheries.
There are no harbors or commercial fisheries
within the Planning Area. Due to the limited
amount of waterways in the vicinity, any
fishing conducted in the Planning Area is
primarily of a recreational nature.
OPEN SPACE FOR RECREATION
Recreational lands are different from other
open space lands by their availability for
public access and direct recreational uses.
State law and policies, as expressed
particularly in the requirements for the Open
Space Element of the General Plan, promote
the retention of open space for recreational
purposes. Beyond the general requirements,

the presence of flammable substances, faulty

arson. The Uniform Building Code, adopted

activities that use flammable or explosive

  uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings).
Note:      For the purposes of the Noise Element,
           transportation noise sources are defined as traffic on
           public roadways, railroad line operations, and aircraft
           in flight. Control of noise from these sources is
           preempted by Federal and State regulations. Other
           noise sources are subject to local regulations, such
           as a noise control ordinance. Non-transportation
           noise sources may include industrial operations,
           outdoor recreation facilities, HVAC units, loading
           docks, etc.
GOAL NO-4. Prevent the introduction of new
fixed noise sources in noise-sensitive areas.
