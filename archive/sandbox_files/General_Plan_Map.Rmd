I renamed these General Plan text files because they had typos:

City_Chinio_Hills.txt -> City_Chino_Hills.txt
City_Clistoga.txt -> City_Calistoga.txt
City_Coahella.txt -> City_Coachella.txt
City_Filmore.txt -> City_Fillmore.txt
City_Hidden_Hill.txt -> City_Hidden_Hills.txt
City_Hunington_Park.txt -> City_Huntington_Park.txt
City_La_Canada-Flintridge.txt -> City_La_Canada_Flintridge.txt
City_Palo_Verdes_Estates.txt -> City_Palos_Verdes_Estates.txt
City_Placenta.txt -> City_Placentia.txt
City_Rolling__Hills_Estates.txt -> City_Rolling_Hills_Estates.txt
City_Sun_City.txt -> City_Menifee.txt
City_Temucla.txt -> City_Temecula.txt
City_Whitter.txt -> City_Whittier.txt

```{r}

#The following text was updated in the dataframe in order to match the file names. 

city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub("Angels", "Angels Camp", city_sf_fixed$FILE)
city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub("Gustine", "Gustine City", city_sf_fixed$FILE)
city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub("Truckee", "Town of Truckee", city_sf_fixed$FILE)
city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub("Tustin", "Tustin Foothills", city_sf_fixed$FILE)
city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub("Windsor", "Town of Windsor", city_sf_fixed$FILE)
city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub("Yreka", "Yreka City", city_sf_fixed$FILE)
city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub("St. ", "Saint ", city_sf_fixed$FILE)
city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub(" \\(.*\\)", "", city_sf_fixed$FILE)
city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub("Ã±", "n", city_sf_fixed$FILE)
city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub("-", "_", city_sf_fixed$FILE)
city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub("de ", "De ", city_sf_fixed$FILE)
city_sf_fixed$FILE <- gsub(" ", "_", city_sf_fixed$FILE)

```

```{r}
file_names <- 
  read.csv("fileNames.csv")
```


There ended up being six rows with duplicated file names because the following six names had both a city and a census designated place with the same name. They have different geographies however. 

El Cerrito 
Greenfield
Live Oak
Mountain View
Paradise
Rolling Hills
